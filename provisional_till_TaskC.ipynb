              "'entry level performance luxury sedans are a hot area for car manufacturers and enthusiasts alike these sedans show their performance by being fun to drive and handling well they show luxury by offering leather and some of the important creatures comforts found in the most luxurious upscale sedans the selection of vehicles that compete in the space is vast and varied the benchmarks which define this are the bmw 330 and the audi a4 30 but there are many contenders such as acura tls chrysler 300m jaguar xtype infiniti i35 mercedes cclass volvo s60 t5 some companies have contenders that emphasize performance lexus is300 or luxury lexus es300 and the field is continously growing with the recent additions being the cadillac cts and infiniti g35 the common charateristics of this entry level perfomance luxury group seem to a price around 30 to 40k us dollars and 060 times between six and eight seconds with this wide variety of cars targeted at a similar market segment the choices for our own personal car are great but with all these choices it is hard to understand and personally evaluate all these options so this topic has been created to start a discussion on the relative merits and personalities of the cars available in this entry level performance luxury field i personally think that with a few tweaks the c320 could also sit at the top of this group its still more of a entrylevel luxury sedan than mercedes would lead you to believe the c320 sport needs to have its suspension retuned to accept 17 inch tires without a harsh ride mb also needs to stop forcing metal trim and black leather on everyone that wants the sport package the c240s 6speed wouldnt hurt either if offered on the c320 though it needs to be fixed first that said my favorite of the group is gasp the new a4 30 the a4 easily has the best interior of any sub40k car combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite the single thing i dont like about the a4 is the grey trim around the bottom of the car this trim doesnt match any of the body colors as it should be body color anyway this is an excellent car and in my opinion the best there is under 40k the upcoming a4 convertible coupe and s4 will all be winners the bmw 330i is now an old favorite but im of all people starting to tire of the 3series just a bit save the m3 variants i was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift they could have done a little more in the way of styling i hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models the acura tls is easily my favorite fwd car in this class wonderful engine you actually can hear it and decent handling for a front driver nice price seats and what not not hard to see why the tl is so popular this cars main faults are styling and obvious costcutting in the interior stereo fake wood etc otherwise a standout lexus es300 nice but not my type of car at all this is one for the buick set the is300 is half baked but has a wonderful chassis styling is also in question here it simply doesnt look like a 35k car grown the interior is gawdawful bet on the next is300 being done right from the start in their defense toyota didnt initially intend for this car to be sold in the us so it was a rush job the cts holds the greatest unrealized potential here ive seen several now and each time i see one they look better and better again like the c320 is300 the car has interior issues the dash feels like it was made by rubbermaid if youre going to be stingy with wood trim why bother half of the steering wheel in wood and very little anywhere else in the car the seats are very good though as is the handling a work in progress the g35 looks like it may have a winning chassis but the interior though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago lots of square shapes and flat surfaces another great engine waiting to drive this one dont really care much for the xtype if i were a jaguar man id be truly pissed at ford and jaguar for this one they are actually selling a fwd xtype in england and ive read where theyre thinking about selling it here hell no the car should have been rwd not awd some will tell you that this was done to compete with audi thats bs awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd without spending the money to convert the car to rwd it is a good looking car though and that jaguar leaper will be enough for some but this car has to grow on me the chrysler 300m is about as close to an audi that american cars come this new 300m special is truly a good looking car inside and out one problem where is the performance a 255hp car in this class with a 060 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable something is not right here some say engine transmission andor gearing but whatever it is chrysler needs to let some mb engineers have a look at this car the heavier e320 with less power is faster i still like this car but its no lust object once you get past the great styling m i am debating a new purchase and these two are at the top of my list the price difference between these two is approx 6k nontype s acura is the es300 worth 6k over the tl i dont know because i have never owned a tl but i am familiar with the es300previous generation supposedly the 2002 es300 is a lot better than the previous generation but is it that much better than the tl of great importance to me is initial quality and overall dependability does the tl compare with the es300 in both of these categorys i am not familiar with the honda co are prices lower than lexus for service work i would appreciate any input on this dilemma from some tl owners great handling rwd excellent engine and the best warranty around easy winner and no manual tranny that may not matter to you but it most certainly does matter to me and many other enthusiast drivers so imo its not even on the board let alone the easy winner one beauty of bmw 3 series is that there are so many models to choose from almost half of all buyers in america dont get the basic rwd 4 door sedan besides having 3 engine and 3 transmission choices you can get coupe convertible awd station wagon and superhigh performance mseries hungrywhale i concur that having the availability of a manual transmission across the line is absolutely critical good grief so you wait 9 months for the manual even with an auto i prefer to every car listed and i never have owned an auto and never thought id enjoy driving a car with an auto thats what value performance and an exceptional engine can do for a car once the g has a stick there is not another sedan under the m3 that id consider ill give it a fair shot when the manual comes out but im just flatout not interested in an auto i dont care how fast it is its not about the speed its about the driving experience and having more control over the car i understand its not about the speed i really dont care if the car wont do over 100 as i rarely break the century mark what i do care about is power and with the manual mode on the auto i can get it when i want it will i buy an autoequipped g in all likelihood no i desperately want to drive the 6 speed it sounds like you know why i wont even put it on my list let alone at the top until the manual comes out is there such a thing as an automaticonly true performance sedan not in my book certainly not in europe or asia only in america is such an oxymoron possible sad if or when the manual g35 comes out and the coupe version then the g35 will be interesting enough to be a serious contender in this segment if i had to rank the entry lux performance sedans here is what i would choose audi a4 30lots of bang for the buck loads of style and loads of luxury cadillac cts decent btfb good handling nonlemming style infinity g35tons of bftb good luxury but completely boring exterior and even more boring of an interior bmw 325very little bftb excellent handlingbuild qualityresale classy looking but too conservative for me saab viggenalmost zero bftb spotty build quality but the damn coolest style in the world everything else is not worth my time hey my friend dig this in australia the only 5series that can be had with a manual gearbox is the m5 yeah right not the 525i 530i 535i or the 540i they are all automatic only  best regards\\nshipo is there such a thing as an automaticonly true performance sedan not in my book certainly not in europe or asia only in america is such an oxymoron possible sad\\nif or when the manual g35 comes out and the coupe version then the g35 will be interesting enough to be a serious contender in this segment riez i read from your profile that you have a manual bmw 5series but i think you are wrong to not consider a car such as a infiniti g35 to be a serious contender as a performance luxury sedan from your logic then the bmw 3series your wifes or the 5series with the steptronic should not be contenders either thats belittling the infiniti audi lexus acuras bmws etc with automatics when i return in december from qatar i plan on purchasing a sports sedan im leaning on the g35 but the bmw 330i along with the audi s4 are also contenders imo if the handling of the infiniti is as good as the bmw as some that drove it has stated then it will hard to pass up especially for the price also my first choice will be a manual and infiniti should have the manual out by december i will test drive all three manual and automatics and make my choice from there i do agree with you that manuals are more fun to drive and that will be my first choice but automatics in this category especially those made by bmw infiniti and others should not be eliminated as performance sedans different flavors for different people i have been following discussions on many boards and what i have been noticing is that there is so many experts on what is the best sports sedan and most havent even driven the competitors to give an honest opinion this is not aimed at you riez or shipko because your profiles states that you own a bmw already but from what i noticed is that some bmw supportors dont even own a bmw at least not from their profile or they state that they never drove an infiniti g35 but they still make unsupported facts assumptions or opinions on such see the edmunds bmw 3series discussion i hope in your defense reiz that you drove the automatic infiniti g35 to give an opinionated statement that it doesnt classify as a performance sedan i value your opinion and others as well again im not flaming you but i try to be an informed consumer before i buy anything that is the reason that i will drive every car that im interested in and make my choice from there im also always interested in those opinions from people that own the type of car im shopping for and at least drove it so they can give valid pronegative statements cheers i think what riez and i are trying to say is not that automatics perform poorly or that only weenies drive them but any car that truly holds itself out as a performance sedan needs at least the option of a manual tranny manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver theres nothing at all wrong with automatics but i sure dont want one amen in this class the best bang for the buck has to be is300 assuming one can live with the styling i guess im one of the few that likes the old a4 styling to the new isnt the new a4 pushing 3600 lbs now thats pretty heavy for this class even at 29k for a 35k msrp is300 i passed on it now i never drove a manual one they werent out yet but even with a manual given the cars horrible drivefeel poor interior and lethargic steering i dont think id go near one theyre not up to audibmwmbinfiniti never liked a lexus and probably never will i would rather drive the cts there is always something that irritates me about them i would buy the is as a toyota but not a lexusi personally think lexus should have a car in its lineup with this cheap of an interior and with this much sporting character toyota deserves something like it though also i dont think 215 horsepower for 29k is a lot of bang for the buck considering the g35 is the same price with 260 horsies i would buy the is as a toyota but not a lexus how else are they going to get that extra 5k from you then reasonably equipped g35 goes for 33k or so i couldnt have said it better myself ill let you lead services mbarto i most certainly will test a g35 manual if and when it finally comes out i promise automatics make nice luxury sedans and maybe even sporty luxury sedans but not performance sedans or luxury performance sedans i dont even consider the 540ia sport truly worthy though it is as close as one can get in an automatic if i could just get my wife to drive a manual thanks riez let me know when you do im sure youll get a chance before i will since i wont return until december i am curious of how it compares to the bmws you can speak from experience so ill value your opinion it does make a difference being married lol see the latest discussions on the infiniti g35 vs bmw 330i board first im fortunate to have a wife that can drive a manual not that she prefers that her first choice is an automatic but she appreciates the hard work and sacrifice im doing out here and knows that this car is for me first family second of course it helps my cause when i let her buy a new dining room set last month and new living room drapes this month bribes do help whatever i finally decide im sure shell be happy mbarto as regards the bribes issue youve figured out one of lifes great truism you get what you want so i can get what i want so if someone were looking to purchase a new performance luxury sedan today what cars would they have to take a look at and test drive lets say they only had time to look at five what five would they have to look into since it has to have a manual transmission and should be rwd awd4wd adds too much weight and complexity and has to be fun to drive hard 1 bmw 3 series manual\\n2 lexus is300 manual\\n3 cadillac cts manual\\n4 lincoln ls6 manual if you want affordable and can go fwd then add nissan maxima 6speed with lsd and maybe altima 35se 5speed try to get car with lsd inline 6s are magnificently smooth engines possible future car infiniti g35 sedan when it finally gets the 6speed manual the tl should be up for redesign in a few years so a tl would be outdated in the not so far future and besides it seems like everyone who drives an acura drives the tl i love the es300 some say it looks bloated i dont think it does at the 34 angle it looks impressive the interior is as nice as a car can get if i had the money i would buy an es300 in a heartbeat i never did like the past ones boring stylingespecially since the last two generations were nearly twins go with the es besides lexus quality is ahead of acuras the new es is a very smart looking car notwithstanding any engine issues though i think there are direct price competitors like the i35 that offer better overall value on paper now i havent driven either new model i did drive the older es300 and it did its job very well they are both great cars lexus for legendary reliability and resale value infiniti for uptodate features umyou left off the infiniti g35 and its bland boring brother the i35 the es300s competition 29k gets someone a 4 door 260 hp performance entry level luxury sedan with all sorts of goodies sorry i thought that i had already taken up too much space and i also was getting tired of typing when i check out an infiniti g35 maybe ill post something on it i always thought the i35s looked all right even if they arent the most exciting cars ever built go drive one theyre a blast and for the money theyre a steal if someone wants entry level performance luxury at a great price the gs really tough to beat save for bmw it sort of stands head and shoulders over most of its competition i cant make a decision i was set on the mb c240 but then i read some postings from people who got lemons now i am starting to think that the audi 30 cvt front wheel drive is what i shoud get any advice low manintenance is what i am looking for\\nthanks well im a benz fan first and foremost but the a4 30 cvt just offers more for the money the a4 has a better interior the top a4 engine compared to the c240 which is the base c and its styling is at least as good as the benz if not better both makes pay for scheduled maint during the warranty period neither car will be low maintanence after the warranty runs out especially the audi with its fairly different transmission if youre priced these cars and theyve come out equal go for the audi its the better value here m i think both are excellentsp cars however neither one is a low maintenance automobile that is to say neither brand is known for low maintenance what they do offer is luxury and performance in an aesthetically pleasing package and some would argue a superior ownership experience as someone has said before every manifacturer makes lemons  some more than others  but the internet is not the best place to find information about that most people are just venting and are not representative of the owner community although i can not speak as to the driving merits of the cars i suspect that they are similar since ive heard read good things about both the a4 cvt and the c240 something to keep in mind is that anytime a new product is offered by the industry it usually takes a couple of years for the company to work out all the bugs in the technology both cars are relative newcommers to the market the facts that they are made by distinguished companies and use proven powerplants does not speak conclusively as to how reliable the cars will be as a whole since you are already looking for alternatives to the mb because of reliability concerns it may be worth your time to look at other alternatives than the audi as someone has suggested in the help me choose forum try looking to lexus for the answer they seem to make reliable cars that are also cheap to keep running of course now we get into the issue of european vs asian luxury  it has come to my attention that as of late mb has taken a hit in its reputation people have been quick to point at the recent survey results  both european and domestic  that say mercedes is no longer reliable these surveys show that statistically speaking mb has as much as doubled the amount of repairs that they do under warranty i wont deny these findings but i will try and justify them 1st and foremost mb has and is comming out with newer designs every year updating the cars both inside and out anytime that a new product makes its debue it takes a couple of tries to get all the kinks worked out secondly according to mbspycom mercedes accounted for half of the profits by dcx last year i think mb is being used as a cash cow to keep jeep and co affloat thereby driving mercedes to costcutting through corparate pressure lower quality parts equal lower overall car quality these two should get things going  feel free to agree or disagree there is not much to debate on this subject if you want a reliable car you buy japanese if you want a drivers car you used to have to buy european the japanese just do quality better and more consistantly than anyone else you also get a lot more car for your money with a japanese vehicle there was a time when the europeans built the best driving cars in the world sadly for them those days are passing the japanese keep building cars that are closer and closer to european driving dynamics is and gs series lexuslexi and q45 and g35 infinitis while the europeans quality especially daimlerchrysler just is not keeping up gave up nationality based generalizations a couple of years ago im interested more towards performance than luxury also value is an important component for me although i have the money to buy these cars i also have other fun things and places to spend it im looking to buy the car and keep it for around 710 years its very sunny with no snow here as well i also want an automatic or cvtgasp so right now the five i am going to look at more closely are as follows 1 bmw 330i\\n2 audi a4 30 cvt\\n3 infiniti g35\\n4 acura tls\\n5 nissan altima 35 se the bmw represents the top of the class but it also has the highest price the altima represents the most performance oriented family car which is a cheaper class of cars the bmw and altima will bracket the value equation the other three all have the potential to compete for my dollars cars that are missing is300 too small while the styling of the cts s60 t5 and 95 aero are not for me the es300 and i35 dont have enough performance for me everything more expensive than a comparibly equipped 330i was also excluded what do you guys think anything missing thanks\\ncybersol cybersol i cant fathom why you would want to go with slushbox but that is your loss comparing fwd to rwd is like apples to oranges not sure what sort of real price range you are looking at the 330i with options might push 40000 you might really consider the much less expensive 325i an altima 35se with few options might have a 25000 msrp read motor trends review of i35 theirs had more than enough performance 060 mph in 70 seconds fastest in their comparison test and it can be had with a sport package but you might be better off with a loaded maxima se or gle saving thousands off the i35 you might also consider volkwagen passat that can also be had with awd if you like awd the jag xtype should be on your list from the domestic corner you might also consider a lincoln ls 6 or 8 or chrysler 300m surprised your list excludes the mercedesbenz cclass and if you can live with a fwd automatic a loaded camry or accord v6 or avalon might be acceptable near the altimas price range sorry to disappoint with the slushbox but if we were all the same life would be boring and there would only be 1 car type i would prefer rwd but the best fwds torque sensitive steering are getting close enough to bring the acceptable price premium for rwd down price range is 2540k as you mention passat 300m 325i are too slow for me the c classes are either too slow or more expensive than the bmw i would choose the bmw over the xtype as they are similarly priced and i live in sun country the maxima better value than the i35 is a good suggestion and i am considering that equally with the altima at the lower end my wife loves camrys but im looking for excitement slushbox or not thanks\\ncybersol the new altima is great as my friends just bought one however dollar for dollar i think the maxima is the overall winner for a fwd car if you can live without the amenities of the i35 the gle with leather sunroof bose cant be beat ive owned two maximas me i recently made the jump to the 330i and its been worth every penny however the g35 owners are very passionate about their choices for a couple of dollars more than the maxima hovering around the i35 i guess the tls cant be beat either i understand when it comes down to it you pick what you think has the right combination of value performance luxury and the right type of car for you for every person it is different when i got the bmw i was crossshopping suvs minivans and fwd passenger cars to see what struck my fancy and i was ready to get an explorer cybersol excitement and slushbox dont seem to be compatible i cant get too excited about fwders certainly not a slushbox fwder not sure what you mean about the best fwders torque sensitive steering very powerful fwders tend to suffer from severe torque steering use of equal length halfshafts and limited slip differential can help but not completely eliminate the laws of physics remain when the drive wheels and steering wheels are one and the same and you have a powerful motor youll get some torque steering do you have kids plan to in near future if not have you considered any coupes or convertibles they can be a bit more exciting excitement and slushbox dont seem to be compatible agreed unfortunately most american drivers dont seem to get it they care about silly stuff like 060 14 mile hp  torque numbers but choose to miss out on the fun part of driving riez you have heard of speed sensitive steering this varies the power steering boost as with the speed acura claims to have torque sensitive power steering on the tls not the tl though this would supposedly vary the power steering boost with the torque being applied and that in theory could eliminate a large amount of torque steer found in powerful fwd cars it still doesnt eliminate the fwd tendency to under steer due the the drive wheels being the same as the turning wheels cybersol there are two types those tied to engine output and those tied to road speed i have heard that the latter are superior since you can vary engine speeds rpms a lot depending upon gear being used and speed even while driving relative steady speeds better systems vary boost on road speed since you normally need more assist at low speeds regardless of engine rpms here is all that the lengthy fullcolor tl brochure says steering variable powerassist rackandpinion this is off the tech specs on page 30 i cannot find a single mention of the steering system anywhere else in the brochure so if acura thinks its variable assist power steering system is special they are keeping it a secret this large brochure covers both the tl and tl type s yeah i have that brouchure and they dont mention the difference between the tl and tls though they say both have variable power assist they do not say how it varies but on the acura website tl  specifications  bodysuspensionchassis it says \\nsteering type tl type s  torquesensitive variable powerassisted rackandpinion steering 32tl  speedsensitive variable powerassisted rackandpinion steering \\nheres the link if you want to check it out httpwwwacuracommodel_tltl_spec_resultsasp \\nhard to find but not a secret cybersol from what ive read the better variable power assist system is tied to road speed not engine rpms once you get a car up to 25 mph or more there isnt much need for assist even if your rpms decline due to turning or downshifting and certainly once you hit 45 mph or more there isnt much need for assist no matter what happens to your rpms but keep in mind that torque steering isnt due to the steering system it is due to other factors can be very pronounced in powerful fwders corrective actions include limited slip differentials and equal halfshafts need to provide equal power simultaneously to drive wheels from standing start floor your car see if the wheel pulls in one direction youll have to correct with the steering wheel to keep the car straight but by then youll have already encountered the torque steering you can also notice it if you are aggressively accelerating in a curve wheels pull you out of your intended direction and you have to correct so if you read through most of this group alot of references went out to audi give a guy a hand here and compare an audi a4 30 to an audi s4 i see a difference of about 5k 30hp and a sporty suspension why shouldnt i load up a 30 rather than going after the s4 oh and does anyone know on possible improvements for one or the other for 2003 have you driven them both the s4 really moves even by audis own 060 times the s4 manual is 1 second faster and the s4 tiptronic is 12 seconds faster yet the s4 is currently based on the 2001 a4 platform and it is scheduled to be upgraded to the new platform in the 2003 model year expect the performance difference to increase as the indications are that the new s4 will pack 300 or more hp hope this helps ive tested the 30 not the s4 hmmm new s4 in 03 huh maybe i should just wait what do you think cybersol right now th3 current s4 states 250hp yes yeah the current s4 has 250 hp and 258 lbft of torque the torque is fully online by 1850 rpm so this is why it scoots the new s4 should be really nice if you have the time to wait it might be worth seeing it might move up in price a little if the performance gets closer to the bmw m3 but then the old s4s should be easier to pick up at a good price right as the new ones are coming out so many decisions have fun making the right one for you not so fast there is merit to the nationality based debate let me explain to you why japanese cars have higher quality in terms of reliability than american or european cars the reason is cultural americans have always had an adventurous entrepreneurial spirit we take chances its not in our nature to accept things as they are i think this is somewhat genetic since the vast number of us are descended from immigrants  arent we all really  people who took tremendous risk and had great courage to brave the unknown for the promise of a new and better life as such in areas of design we bore very easily americans are always looking for the next great thing the next new design the next technology breakthrough europeans especially germans are like this about cars if not about everything else the us auto industry is always ready to chuck the old and start over from scratch  witness chrysler and ford over the last two decades as such our products are usually stylish and inventive but not very refined  see minivans suvs cabforward nightvision etc the japanese by comparison have a culture that is traditional and thousands of years old they have made an entire culture out of honoring tradition and the status quo we had to yank them kicking and screaming into the 20th century after world war ii i know this is somewhat simplistic but bear with me what the japanese are good at is taking an idea and refining it year after year until it is near perfect there is very little innovation or risk taking that is why the cars are so bland when was the last time you saw a new technology invented in japan vcrs computer technology cell phones the microwave ovenall american inventions that are better built by the japanese the same goes for cars most innovations come from the us or germany with some safety innovations coming from scandinavia give up the turbos and 5cylinders already those are as refined as theyre going to get anywaywhen you distill it down to its essence this is why toyotas and hondas never break its also why they are no more than transportation appliances and this is why the best performance cars from japan will always be knockoffs albeit sometimes very good ones of something somebody else does better and more originally ill step off my soap box now and await your wailing the problem is that they are huge generalizations also you are talking japanese as almost exclusivly honda and toyota what about subaru mazda isuzu mitsubishi daihatsu and suzuki so far the only makes that seem to keep with that japanese culture are toyota and honda and many american and european makes are now capable of having higher quality than more than 70 of japanese cars doesnt help your generalization that much does it so where do the generalizations stop they should stop with brands and not nations have found out that with some of the more powerful cars like the g35 or corvette the difference in performance from a practical standpoint isnt really an issue because these cars are faster than we can ever dream of driving without either killing ourselves or getting tickets all the time i have an automatic g35 and love it being that it is an automatic i can enjoy my coffee shave talk on my cel phone and hug my wife while driving in rush hour traffic if i feel the urge which i dont very often i can shift the manumatic and pretend it is a stick when i get my ferrari it will have the paddle shifting because i dont ever want another clutch just my opinion paul el cajon california how does your theory explain english cars a country steeped in tradition producing poor quality cars with little inovation look what a traditionalist country managed to do to the acura legend when they produced it as a stirling lol  quote wishnhigh1 what about subaru mazda isuzu mitsubishi daihatsu and suzuki so far the only makes that seem to keep with that japanese culture are toyota and honda  those cars in general reflect the perfectionist attitude of 1pierces post with virtually no exception the overall quality of japanese brand cars especially fit and finish considerably excels the american brands from what i have read this is due to the attitude of japanese management in not accepting mediocre craftsmanship not the abilities of the assembly line workers you may have a point though that some of the japanese brands show as high a level of innovation as the american and german brands after all which country has used the wankle rotary and miller cycle engines and who introduced us to the vtec engines etc american management leans strongly to the bottom line and ceo bonuses with refinement and polish falling by the wayside as a casuality of the heavy handed management style being that it is an automatic i can enjoy my coffee shave talk on my cel phone and hug my wife while driving in rush hour traffic truly critical things to do while ones driving he did mention in rush hour traffic like theres anything else to do in bumpertobumper not like rush hour demands anything of the driver ive read books while in traffic let out clutch apply gas push in clutch glide repeat snooze edmunds has a new feature called true cost to own it is listed when one researches out the various vehicles on the new car heading it is one of the 13 subjects when you click on a particular vehicle it is very useful when comparing one vehicle to another true cost to own takes the purchase price and adds things like depreciation insurance license fees etc and gives you a figure for 5yr ownership they even tailor it to your particular zip code i tried it on a few vehicles and it is very useful i have not had a chance to look at it in person but does the 38k passat w8 fit into the entry level performance luxury sedan category any other upcoming next year or so vehicles fit into this category but its not really a performance sedan drive one and then take on a bimmer or g35 night and day vws are nice inside and good for cruising but their handlings akin to riding a pig in a hurry i beg to differ while i admit that i am biased obviously since i bought one i believe that the w8 is really a performance sedan i test drove the g35 and several bmws and a few others before making my final choice i suppose the term 145performance sedan146 could be defined in any number of ways for me the w8 offers everything i want 150 and nothing i don146t isn146t that a recent nissan 145tag line146 take straight line acceleration for instance vw literature quotes 0 150 60 in 65 sec to me this is pretty quick for a 4 door sedan my fearless  prediction of future test acceleration numbers is 0 150 60 in 65 sec as vw claims and a quarter mile in about 150 at 94  95 i base this on a number of things for instance in the may 2000 car and driver comparison that included the lincoln ls8 sport and the audi a6 27tt the audi tested had virtually identical curb weight as the w8 identical final drive wheel  tire size and tiptronic the hp  tq for this audi were 250  258 and their test results were 0 150 60 in 66 sec and the quarter mile in 151 at 94 thus my w8 with 270  273 ought to do slightly better we146ll see   btw in the same test the lincoln ls8 sport they tested turned in acceleration numbers of 0 150 60 in 75 and the quarter mile in 157 at 90 this was my previous car so it seems reasonable that my w8 feels quicker 150 setting aside the notorious unreliability of everyone146s 145butt dyno146 does it pull the same lateral g as the g35 or a bmw 3 series wsport package almost certainly no but with more aggressive rubber i expect that it will provide enough grip for entertainment value at any sane public road speed just my opinions cheers\\n ray\\noff shortly to put on a few more 145breakin146 miles at lunch    i recently went through the list of entry level carsi was in test drive heaven 325i  very nice car best shifterclutch of all but not enough power for me great motor though as fas as smoothness the interior is average nothing better with leather and wood it helps but you either dig it or you dont 330i  same as above but better power although i find the power to be linear you can really move in this car but the sensation of thrust is lacking i like that sunroof and leather are std better value overall than 325i plus std 17 wheels although with allseasons pricy is300 nice manual tranny and smooth motor thats about it hate the interior feels claustrophobic and chintzy xtype  i liked the 30l sport but did not like the grey stained maple didnt look like a jag very nearly purchased a 30l british racing green with ivory leather and beautiful walnut but with options this car is riciulously overpriced makes the bmw look like a bargain hunter too bad nice motor and very good manual tranny and ride brakes were strong one thing about the motor was it just didnt feel or go like 060 65 as advertised nicest interior overall a4 30  porky ponderous even with sport package did not feel swift and easily the worst tranny available in this segment nice interior leather was only average you could barely tell the difference between the leather and leatherette which is a good thing if you are cheap but bad if you opt for leather by the way the leather in the bmw was much better s4 2001 nice but not as fast as i thought it would be i did drive a 99 mustang gt it rockets off the line but it isnt that impressive afterwards nicer seats and support but interior is too gloomy 250bhp and 258 lb ft motor is not an audible delight the 2002 a4 30 sounds amazing compared to the s4 i think the backpressure has gobbled up the exhaust note an exhaust would be perfect here they were giving them away 9000 off msrp  and people were definitely buying but it just looked dated now beside the new ones g35  went and looked at one in showroom and was not impressed and without a manual tranny i wasnt interested one bit i still managed to drive one and was impressed with the torque it definitely had thrust that the others lacked except the s4 nice seats and neat touches for rear passengers i really liked the dynamics of the car but the tranny left me cold the fit and finish was poor maybe it was an early modelno dicker sticker which made it cost as much as the a4 30 and bmw 330i was close lincoln ls v6  very good handling and crisp 5 speed engine was thrashy at high revs which is particularly bad because it needs to be revved to really move torque is lacking here but i liked the car overall especially with the sport susp acura tls another auto tranny but an incredible motor definitely my favourite v6 of all of them as far as sound is concerned interior average and handling soso excellent price volvo s60 t5  i chose this car for its thrust come to think of it 3bhp less and 15 lbft less than the s4 is quite close to the s4 and it is lighter fwd torque steer is evident only beyond 810ths but it is there no question about it best seats best stereo average steering feel falls behind the jaguar and bmw brakes while strong are grabby but it takes getting used to amazing power and style seems decent off the line but after 100kmh it easily pulls the hardest price was also a consideration as it was cheaper than bmw audi jaguar didnt drive the cts but i am sure it is excellent in conclusion these are all excellent cars and even though we all nitpick this and that on all of them i would be fine with any of them in my driveway honestly i had the grave misfortune to drive a cts and its not in the same league as the bimmer audi infiniti or even the lesser acuralexusjag the cts i drove was a 5 speed sport model with a sticker of 38k gasp the tranny was rough very rough almost mustang bad the interior felt cheap with lots of hard plastic and very little in the way of substantial or softtouch materials the throttle response was weak and required excessive modulation of a rather awkward gas pedal the cars a rolling bed of 1998 technology no automatic brake distribution for one thing the salesmen kept insisting 4 channel abs is impressiveto each his own handling nothing at all like the claims car mags are making it was a slow reacting boatturn the wheels feel the car undulate and then slowly shift directions not impressive in the least in fact when the salesguy asked me what i thought after the drive i told him the cts wasnt even a real competitor to the germans or japanese he snorted and reminded me this is a caddy not a sports car yeah well that caddy can sit on the lot with the other heaps they have congradulations on your new s60 t5 it is a great looking car and i hope you are very happy with it i saw a really nice one in front of me this morning have fun with it hey blueguy what wrond with the mustang tranny i know it is not a fwd type gearbox but when you have 300 lbft of torque twisting that car you need a strong tranny in all honesty the clutch while incredibly easy to modulate was hevay but with a purpose never missed a gear either which cant be said about the a4 6speed jagboyxkr i know you have an xtype and i was right in there to the end with this car bottom line was 10000cdn difference the way they package the options is ridiculous i needed the split fold seats but they were bundled in a 2000 package xenons twice asmuch as any other car 160000 sunroof another 160000 it was unbeleivable but the lease rate was very low 19 which helped make up the difference i dont care what anybody says about the xtype because most have never driven them it is imo a better overall car than the audi in canada awd is recommendedthis car gets slaughtered because of its high price this car should have been priced equal to the leader of the class but to price it more than the best car in the segment is suicide in this hot market the t5 is broken in nicely i have over 2000 miles on it now and it is everything i expected what i didnt expect was the sheer power this thing has after 100kmh i think it would beat my mustang at that speed in a rolling start no question i would even say an s4 hey ive never driven an 18 wheeler so maybe the mustangs tranny isnt like one but thats how i imagine a big rigs tranny to feel thanks for the comparison post it was very informative congratulations on your s60 t5 i didnt want a manual tranny because i like to eat a sandwich or be on the phone roll updown windows and sunroof at any time while i drive i testdrove a used 98a4quattro 28 new 325ci325xi i loved those bimmers and audi was a great car but the bottom line sticker is what made me go with the acura with the steptronic this car is an absolute joy i went from a 1993dodge pos im only at 150miles so far but no complaints and extremely satisified with my decision what does a manual have to do with eating drinking talking windowing  lol sunroofing  i have a manual actually never owned an automatic and i have no problems carrying on several tasks at once its just like walking and talking it sounds like he got the right car for him i guess you guys have become very experienced with manuals i feel they are fun and someday when im rich and famous lol i hope to have a manual porsche or something like that but for now the sequential shifter gives me enough performance so that stones arent casted at one another i would like to remind everyone that this is my opinion which is why we have these forums cmnott i respect your opinion about the jag and the audi 30although i strongly disagree i guess as a 30 owner i would i personally found the jag xtype to be the worst car i have ever test driven first it was 3000 more than the audi second well it is a ford and felt like a ford the handling in no way compared to the 30 the interior might look a little better but certainly did not feel any better as for performance i am a little dissapointed with th 30 and i think they could have used a 250260 hp engine to solve the problems however it is still a fun engineespecially at highway speeds i honetsly felt that the mondeo excuse me xtype was going to fall apart on my test drive now i know audi has had its problems but not even close to comparison with the negative headlines for the xtype oh wellto each their own enjoy your t5 i came to a different conclusion about the jaguar xtype 30 and the audi a4 30 quattro i was considering both vehicles and it was very close but the jaguar won for me acceleration\\nin acceleration times the jaguar is clearly faster than the audi cardriver states of the xtype subjectively the xtype didnt feel quite as quick as a bmw 330i but a few instrumented acceleration runs revealed that the measured 0to60mph time of 63 seconds was only 02 seconds slower than the small bmw we would rate the smoothness of the xtypes v6 to be similarly close to that of the bavarian inline six roadtrack says of the xtypes performance in acceleration the 30 xtype is among the quickest accompanied by a nicebutdistant exhaust note the jag goes from 060 mph in 65 seconds undercutting the boyracer lexus is 300s and audi a4s 71 the mercedes c320s 68 sec and matching the bmw 330is time jaguar xtype 30 acceleration times 63  65 sec\\naudi a4 30 quattro acceleration time 71 sec   manual transmission handling\\nof how the cars handle rt says of the xtype whether the chassis is redolent of jaguar tradition or not no one complained that it didnt work it feels like a modern wellbalanced sports sedan with excellent highway ride and good balance in the corners every time we got into a long stretch of fast curving mountain road whoever was in the jag inevitably got on the walkietalkies we all carry and said this thing is really good in the curves its a confidenceinspiring car with good grip linear steering and precise turnin the engine is not bad either our test cars optional 30liter 4cam v6 theres a less expensive 25 version as well put out a respectable 231 bhp keeping it in this fast company with no particular effort they also say of its suspension jaguar engineers told us they wanted the suspension to be connected but relaxedand that seems to wrap it up nicely the ride is about as smooth as youll find in this class even with the sport suspension given its soft ride the xtype delivers surprisingly good handling of the audis handling they say dynamically the allwheeldrive car is not as crisp as it looks it handles well enough and has a superb highway ride but it accomplishes these goals in a rather soft and rubbery style of suspension tuning and steeringin short the audi is missing that firm rallycar edge and sense of steering precision that makes the bmw for instance so delightful to drive its a car that can keep up with the other sports sedans but doesnt feel very sporty doing it despite our cars having the optional sport suspension for 750we noticed in some of the whoopdedos and curves of our desert highway that the audi produced considerable excitement as one driver put it and was simply more floaty and loose than the others and again this is where you pay for that great highway ride one driver noted the 30liter 220bhp dohc aluminum v6 is smooth and reasonably peppy though well back from the front of this pack steering\\nmotor trend says of the xtypes zf servotronic ii variableratio speedsensitive rackandpinion steering system the cars best system may be its speedsensitive rackandpinion power steering in fact it matches the previously unrivaled precision served up by bmw 3 series car placement feels laserguided precise with excellent feedback and road feel with complete confidence and comfort we drove at most times with just our fingertips  even at 120 mph on the track the only allwheeldrive car weve ever driven offering similar levels of steering communication is the nissan skyline gtr a pretty racy piece the audis steering was criticized again by car  driver and road  track for being rubbery in feeling and cd said that the steering wheel vibrates at peak engine revs cardriver also says that the steering system of the xtype is nothing short of terrific they call it enthusiast goods forbes even takes note of the steering system in the x jaguar engineers boast its the best steering system theyve ever had on any model we agree allwheeldrive\\naudi is known for its quattro awd system which has been develped for over 22 years now quattro iv its newest version and is used on the a4 it divides power 5050 to the front and rear wheels unless slip is detected and is known to be one of the best systems available torque steer is said to be very minor and it is said to work well with even the turbocharged 18liter 4cylinder versions of the a4 although it is noted by some to feel heavy without the larger v6 audi also used quattro to prove that awd in certain racing conditions could be better than other setups and later was banned from using awd cars in certain races because of its advantages jaguar uses a new awd system they designed called traction 4 which divides torque 40 to the front wheels and 60 to the rear unless slip is detected this along with specially designed roller bearings fitted between the tops of the front strut towers and the body along with its advanced steering mechanism give the performance and feel of a rwd car unlike most awd systems cardriver said that traction 4 produces no torque steer to interphere with the purity of the steering forbes stated of the xtypes awd the xtype gets a seemless virtually transparent new 4060 viscous coupling allwheeldrive system with optional dynamic stability control that rivals audis vaunted quattro for wet and dry weather grip roadtrack said that the jag is better balanced it will understeer during turnin take something of a set and then pull you through its a safe and secure feeling that signals whats about to happen and gives you plenty of time to adjust braking\\nthe xtype features the same vented front and solid rear discs as found on the larger stype road  track said in braking tests the xtype had impressive and easily repeatable stopping distances from 60 mph 118 ft and 80 mph 208 ft in another one of their articles they say the braking distances turned by the xtype are exceptional comparable to those of top sports cars car  driver also said a few laps at the castle combe racetrack allowed us to explore the outer reaches of the xtypes handling where it proved completely benign thanks to the allwheeldrive even at the limit understeer never grinds the front tires excessively but the only way to get the tail out was to flick the steering wheel while simultaneously lifting the throttle the fourwheel disc brakes proved linear and powerful under repeated heavy track use by comparison a bmw mroadster stops from 60 mph in the same 118 feet as the jag the porsche 911 gt2 stops from 60 just two feet shorter than the jag at 116 feet an slk32 amg does it in 127 feet jaguar xtype 30 braking distance from 60 mph 118 ft\\naudi a4 30 quattro braking distance from 60 mph 137 ft iterior\\nhere is where the statements become subjective and anything i say here other than what is quoted from others is just my opinion both the audi and the jaguar offer excellent interiors the jaguar goes for the warmlooking british cabin that its family members also display utilizing massive amounts of wood and conolly leather with bits of chrome the audi has a german functional design that is still inviting with clean lines and details i really like the interiors of both cars the jaguar has the best leather and wood but a few things like the plastic of the audis air vents seems more resilient etc roadtrack said that despite the lowerthanxj price the xtype sports the traditional jaguar upscale cabinthe simple round gauges have an easyontheeyes green backing on the instrument faces theres birdseye maple trim scattered around the cockpit and the seats are tasteful and comfortablethe jags interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures done up with nice details like the silverrimmed greenfaced gauges they say it may be an entry level model but you wouldnt know it judging by all that leather wood and the easy to use nav system motor trend says the xtype has great styling inside and out and says specifically that the interior is soothing luxurious and reasonably sound from an ergonomic standpoint the main instruments are nicely detailed and easily readable through the steering wheel hvac and audiosystem controls are housed in a centrally mounted horseshoeshaped binnacle which allows lots of genuine maple veneer to span the entire dashits pure jag inside and out cardriver says as youd expect the interior is lined in sumptuous connolly leather and birdseye maple wood trim on the dashboard and doors luxury amenities abound as well as the expected front side and head airbagsthe level of finish is very nice with neat stitiching close fits and excellent materials throughout\\n_____________________________ eaweg my opinion is that the audi and the jaguar are both great cars but that the jaguar offers more it is more expensive than the a4 but it is more expensive for a reason it is known to outhandle the a4 and outperform it in acceleration and braking and it has the most rigid chassis in its class 30 more than the previous class leader awd is also standard as well as connolly leather and wood you must have had a bad test car if yours felt like it was going to fall apart because everything i have read and experienced with the xtype says that it is very solid with highquality materials throughout like you said to each their own you can lease an xtype for next to nothinghigh incentives thanks for the responsei too have read all of the magazinesi love automobile literature at the sametime i have come to realize how much biased opinion there is and maybe payoffs \\nanyhow i would agree with you that so far all of the statistics that have come back point to the jag leading in numberswell so does bmw and the g35 i was really interested in the xtype whenit came out it does look quite beautiful howerver i test drove not only one but two same opinion both felt like fast wheelbarrows i think you would agree that what it comes down to is personal preferancei just didnt feel right with the xtype the bmw i tested i liked quite a bit and it was a tough decision i have to be honest and say that it was the quattro that won me over as well as the excellent lease deal my lease on the audi was much better than that on the xtype as well i think that you would also agree that not everyone is going to get a perfect car off the lot even though we all should every car is going to have its minor and unfortunately some major problems fortunately for me and hopefully you i have had none what concerned me was the article i read from autoweek quality problems bedevil jaguars xtype two drivetrain issues cited jaguar cars ltd is at risk of alienating its newest group of owners many of whom complain their new xtype sedans have an array of irritating quality snafus while none of the problems directly affect safety or operation they are of sufficient annoyance that some firsttime jaguar buyers say theyre ready to bolt the franchise there are two separate drivetrain problems during deceleration from about 70 mph a highpitched whine will come from the allwheeldrive differential unit that problem is so widespread that jaguar has issued a technical service bulletin to its us dealers the fix adding mass to the differentialmounting bracket but the cold weather noise is another matter it occurs anywhere from 20 mph to 70 mph for some owners it goes away quickly others have the tuningfork sound ringing for minutes at a time this problem has been the most bothersome to owners because jaguar cars has not officially acknowledged it exists some owners say they have had several propshafts replaced under warranty  one american owner says he is on his sixth steven miller a 41yearold attorney from long beach ny suffers from both drivetrain problems while he says he loves his xtype miller is frustrated by his dealers inability to repair the problems despite three visits to the service bay i made a tape recording of the noise miller said the attempted fix was to put some sort of additive into the allwheeldrive system this quieted the noise for several days then it came back  this is what turned me awaybefore this article came out i had heard about thisi hope it doesnt happen to you guys thanks for the friendly chat thanks for the responsei too have read all

for the friendly chat congrats on your a4 look no question you were quite gracious about my comments about the a4 i was so disappointed with the new styling because i always wanted the previous a4 so to see how it looks personally i hate it maybe it is just me but i just couldnt come to grips with it i found the a4 felt slow reacting whereas the jag had better reflexes but also felt smaller i think it is unfair and untrue to say the ford thing i think that has been addressed whether people choose to beleive it or not the 6 speed was poor there is no other word for it but i really did enjoy the automatic as far as one can the jaguar had a much much better transmission but i was not particularly enamored with the clutch the steering imo was better than almost all i just couldnt justify the price difference when a certain car is trying to make an impression in a hot segment like i said before there are no losers in this segment but i think it is safe to say none of us would go for the winner of the comparo eaweg and jagxboytype i totally agree that it is all personal preference and i really believe that most all of the cars in this segment especially the a4 s60 and xtype are some of the best i dont think there is a best car here since everyone has different needs and preferences they all have their own ups and downs but i think the benefits of each of these cars certainly outweighs most of their negatives as well on the xtype article\\ni read that autoweek article too and it scared me a bit before i went to check out the xtype and made me check the competition before going with the car in the end jaguar seems to have solved most all of those problems in the current xtypes though and the ones being produced now dont have any of those problems i also found two articles in my local newspaper that were on early xtype problems the initial article was much like the autoweek one and the second one came out a pretty long time after the first one it was a followup on how those initially unhappy customers were doing after jaguar north america finally contacted them and worked on their cars they had factory technicians go out and examine the cars and all of that  they even bought back a car and gave the owner a much better new one jaguar was a bit late in contacting them and i agree that it took too long but they did get most all of their xtypes fixed and the customers ended up being very pleased with their cars in the end yes some of the very early production xtypes lived up to their old jaguar reputation for being problematic as the article shows but the newer ones are much better both in quality and reliability jaguar did many things and worked hard to correct the faults of the early cars and they even had the whitley engineering center who designed the driveshafts for the xtype go through five or six different new designs until they finally got it perfect i can personally say from experience that the xtype is not in any way a problem car at least the ones being produced now especially as my own car has had no problems at all it initially had the drippy windshield whiper jets but the dealership simply tightened a valve on the underside of the hood before giving me the car and nothing has gone wrong since ive had it i really love even just being around the cars as it has been so good again it is all personal preference when i sat in the jag for the first time it just felt right i hadnt even adjusted the seat and it just felt so perfect every time i sit in it everything is perfect the whole car is that way for me and i bet your audi is the same for you and if anyone is paying off the media its bmw and infiniti and it appears that infiniti is paying the most i dont think jag even has the funds to do that although global sales were just up 62 in april and theyve had recordsetting sales for the past four consecutive years now and it is very nice to speak to someone civilized on this board take care of your car\\n____________________________ blueguydotcom i actually own my car we paid the dealer in full when we got it the only incentive for the xtype is a pretty good lease price i just checked yesterday but even that has been complained about and called false advertising by many as it is only for the 25 litre model with no options not even paint is included in the advertized price for the lease its also ending in a few months and then prices will be even higher id like to see how people complain about it being very expensive when the 2003 prices come out as they are even higher than this year oh well it is a jaguar after all and a great car on its own option packaging has been reorganized for 2003 however so getting things like sunroofs is easier is the jag even selling i see far more bimmers lexuses g35s and ctses than jag xtypes and i live in car crazy socal the xtype is jaguars fastest selling car right now it accounts for over half of all jaguars sales and it has boosted jaguars global sales by 62 since january 2002 and that number was recorded from april in february of 2002 jaguars us sales alone were up 105 compared to feb 2001 largely because of the xtype xtypes sales have been taking off after a slower start since the events of 911 recorded in may 16171 xtypes have been sold since january 1 2002 in the us of that number 2961 were sold in may jaguar is very happy with its sales also the xtype is supposed to be lower volume than many of its competators as it is a jaguar never the less this compares well with 16395 audi a4s and 16339 volvo s60s sold so far this year the infiniti g35 has only sold 8731 units so far and 11237 cadillac ctss have been sold in 2002 as well thanks to you both for your great chatsi agree with jagboy that its nice to see people talk about things without acting like my dad can beat up your dadmy only knowledge from automobiles is that i have a passion for them mechanically i am okayjust enough to get by its funny after i got my audi the volvo dealer thats 5 miles form my house had a great deal one week later yes i was miffed for about 24 hours but like the both of you i think my personality fits my choice you are absolutely right about there not being a loser in this segment for those who get the g35 more power to youso you can beat me in a straight lineif racing was what i wanted i would have gotten a used s4 and modded it to about 340hpbut i really couldnt see myself doing that for at least the next 4 years of my life for some reason i have a sneaking suspicion that something negative is going to come out about the g35i just cant pinpoint it thought the 02 3 series are just plain ugly with the new facelifts cmnott as for the 6 speed yeah it was pretty odd the first couple of months i can honestly say though that it has brolen in and that it is worlds better than when i first got it to think that the 5spd manual in the 96 saab 900se that i had before it was actually better oh well nice chatting again to jagboyxtype you said the infiniti g35 has only sold 8731 units so far i think its important to point out the g35 has only been on the market since march 11 in the month of april infiniti sold over 3200 g35s i just want to make sure no one is misled by your post my point was that the xtype is selling and that there is a larger amount of them on the road right now than there are g35s or ctss blueguydotcom had asked about its sales numbers and had compared how he had seen few xtypes on the road but many more bimmers lexuses g35s and ctses i just threw in the other cars numbers to demonstrate that although he may have seen more of some of the other cars in actuality there are more xtypes that what he has seen also infiniti sold 3298 g35s in may 2002 since its introduction in march it has sold 8731 units as recorded in may assuming that around 3298 units would have been sold in january and february had the car been introduced earlier and had a start in sales numbers for january 1 like the others it would have sold about 15327 units 3298  3298  8731  15327 the latest sales figures are out the g35 and lincoln ls both sold about 3050 units cadillac cts sold 3475 is300 only 2300 bmw sold 9630 3 series that total for the 3series is for all of its variants though where many of these manufacturers have other models competing for convertible and coupe etc sales volumes the 3series sedan which competes against the cars you mentioned sold 6498 units about the same number as the lexus es 300 which sold 6477 units in may apparently in racetrack fantasy land torque steer is a problem for some im just saying that here in sedan vs sedan form that is how many 3s were sold the other variants are countered with other models in the other marques lineups the sportcross takes on the 3wagons so do the a4 avant v70 cclass wagons and the soon to appear xtype touring the s4 takes on the m3 there is also a c32 amg later the xtype r will also join that crowd the a4 cabriolet takes sales from the 3convertibles an a4 coupe is on the way as is the g35 coupe to take one the coupe 3series there are still is300 coupe rumors too to a lesser extent the cclass coupe takes on the compact 3series in europe and to top that off the new saab 93 is a sedan now with a normal trunk by your thinking you could almost include the z3 roadster in the mix as it shares engines transmissions and platform parts i guess we should include the camry in the es300s sales volume since they share those same parts too how about all of those jettas passats beetles and golfs that come with that 18t engine in the a4 maybe those should be included too what is your source when you quote sales figures for the cars in this discussion group no one has mentioned the acuratl i might assume the tl is a sales leader in this class am i rite autosite appears to be one of the better sources for new car sales in usa pretty easy to navigate honda will reportedly import the jdmeuro accord here as the acura tsx the tsx would replace the now deceased integra sedan in the lineup the jdmeuro car is expected to debut at the september paris auto show in september and be on sale in na in 2003 as a 2004 model\\nfor more info and some early spy pics from various sources see ickes_mobile acura tsx jul 30 2002 1231pm okay my head is spinning ive spent the past month driving several models reading reviews hearing opinions and  truth is these cars under consideration all look great right now im leaning toward bmw 325i but the g35 impressed me greatly also like the passat wagon should i bow to the need for storage space and the idea of saving several k cant be ignored wife has a 2 year old acura 32clwonderfully reliable and comfortable but the bmw infiniti audi a4 et al have strong pull in the area of life is short go for it i guess i d say im looking for a blend of reliability and driving fun id appreciate input from owners of any of the above recent years models thanks xxoneputtxx only you will know what meets your needs within your budget do a ton of research but then spend a lot of time test driving your primary choices dont let em give you the standard dog and pony test drive that wont tell you anything you really need to drive each car some distance on a variety of roads at a variety of speeds i am looking at purchasing the g as a family sedan my 3 kids will easily fit in the rear seat is this too much of a sports car i really like the gs lines thanks i can only speak for the choice between the 325 and the a4 is youre into the hood badge and sound of the exhaust then the beemer is your car if you want a quite similar ride the equipment of a 330 at the price of a 325 then go for the a4 30 i drove several 02 325xis and a4 30 quattros and both had their s the 325 though lacks even the most fundamental standard options no power seats on a 30k car and has a way to go on the interior design cheesy exposed cup holders that look like they belong in a pontiac not to mention the 325 has 30 less power to spin those 4 wheels the sad thing is that virtually all luxury sports sedan reviews compare a 40k loaded 330 with a 33k a4 and the 325 is declared the de facto winner as it rides on the tails of the 330 the whole 3series nomenclature is nonsense take an a4 30 out for a test drive i beleive the handling of the bmw is slightly better because of its small size i would like to see how it would handle if it were a midsize car like the infiniti g35 or acura tl the amount of points that are giving to the bmw for its handling should be removed for its size this is a sedan it is not a sports car when talking about sedans sufficient room in the car should be seen as an important factor im sure they could make the bmw even smaller and get even better handling and performance from it if they did that it would be hard to justify it even being in this category rp  you are correct the 330i is a sedan just like the g35 just like the acura just like the audi and all of the cars that were compared in the latest edmunds roundup none of them are sports cars edmunds calls them entry level luxury sport sedans the fact is the 530i also gets very high marks in the performance department except the 530i is a true luxury sport sedan again not a sports car now the 530i outclasses all of the above in terms of amenities but it would be interesting to see from a strict performance viewpoint how it compares to the above or even compares to the 330i although in the scheme of things size has little to do with performance  as another poster pointed out there are cars the same size as the 330i that are nowhere near it in terms of overall performance note the salient word is overall also the fact that it is a compact has nothing to do with its interior room the g does not have marginally much more room and if you read edmunds roundup it does state there is sufficient room in the car for 4 adults in the 330i unless you regularly transport 5 people and the two people in the back seat absolutely have to have the reclining seats in my opinion the amount of extra space in the g doesnt make that much of a difference it might to you but then you get to vote with your dollars if i regularly transported 5 people however none of the cars in the edmunds roundup would be on my list it seems clear to me based on the reviews ive read over the last couple of years when only talking about the sport of driving in this segment the 330i is the benchmark some acuras are experiencing very serious problems with their automatic transmissions shifting from 5th to 2nd at high speeds for no aparent reason this causes the cars to lose control and swerve off the road httpwwwbuffalonewscomeditorial200209141036070asp \\nmike spencer a spokesman for acura hondas sportluxury division confirmed that there has been a higher than normal incidence of problems with two hondabuilt automatic transmissions although many involve highperformance models such as the 260horsepower acura types others afflict 200horsepower v6 honda accords and 240horsepower odyssey minivans not usually associated with racing and speeding abuses \\nthe two transmissions are the fivespeed used in v6equipped acuras since the 2000 model year and in honda odysseys since the 2002 model year and the fourspeed automatic used in v6 honda accords since 2000 and in 2000 and 2001 odysseys i am having the hardest time choosing a replacement for my 3 year old leased saab 93se ive narrowed it down to the bmw 325i mercedes c240 and vw passat glx they all excel but in different ways ive driven all 3 several times and still cannot decide here are my thoughts and id appreciate comments from others 325i pros\\nfun to drive and handles well\\nlike the sound of the inline 6cyl engine\\nholds its value well\\nnice safety features\\ngood reliability record 325i cons\\nmany on the road\\nstyling not that exciting any more mercedes c240 pros\\nstyling in my opinion\\nsolid as a

my area there are many on the road diminishing the value seriously  i think you have to focus on whats important to you is fun to drive holds value and good safety features important or is styling important and the fact there are many on the road an important criteria because you want a unique vehicle just as a suggestion if you phrased the question differently rather than giving your opinion about the importantance of certain car attributes you might get some very meaningful responses for me important questions might be 1 has anybody had any reliability issues with any of these cars how did the dealers respond\\n2 what do others think about the seating in the vehicles\\n3 how much did people pay good luck with your decision kdshapiro  thanks for your post im finding that its very hard to judge reliability from the internet message boards ive read horror stories on the internet for all three cars people with problems are more likely to post a message than those without problems consumer reports recommends all three cars i personnally know one person with a c240 and one with a c320 wagon both love their cars but havent had them too long i made a mistake with my current car and am determined not to do it again i want to get something i dont mind paying for want to keep for many years and want to keep shiny the problem is all three of these are great cars these are three pretty different cars so it really comes down to what you value the passat is a real bargain with the nicest and largest interior as well as elegant exterior styling i looked hard at a glx and w8 when i was shopping the handling is pretty wallowing and the power is just adequate im a leadfoot  the 325i is fun and rewarding to drive really nice handling and ergonomics its pretty small and the price goes up fast as you add options and its also underpowered for my taste ive never driven the c240 the c320 i drove was nice but not terribly sporty and i was disappointed in the quality of some of the interior pieces they need to see where vw gets their switches all three a very good cars i could be happy with any of them based on my needs does anyone find that the tl has extrememly boring styling ive only seen white tls and they dont look exciting but i havent seen a darker colored tl do the darker colored tls look better also anyone who owns a tl type s how fast does it go from 060 im curious because im crosshopping with the g35 if the tl type s can at least compete with g35s performance that i would be happy the tls does have boring styling and white is its worst color it fairs better in darker colors the overall performance is similar to the g35 though it gets edged out in most categories the biggest difference is fwd vs rwd i spent quite a bit of time in a tls when shopping recently i chose a g35 but if you are a honda fan or prefer fwd the tls is a great choice it will also run you a little less than a comparably equipped g35 and you can probably get a deeper discount to boot there have been concerns about the tls having tranny failures but acuras tend to be very reliable for direct comparisons of the g35 and tls look at the recent edmunds entry sport lux sedan comparo the cd currently on news stands i have to admit its not very credible to me and the july 2002 rt good luck with your shopping wowthat guy in the news clip really does look like the stereotypical computer engineer doesnt he as an avid reader of consumer reports i find it hard to believe that their research didnt uncover any problems with the transmissions in the tl if you read their auto issue they give the tl their highest rating for reliability including the transmission is their something wrong here i read consumers as well my theory is that the percentage is higher than zero which took honda by surprise isolated incidents over tens and thousands of vehicles sold make it a small statistical probability this doesnt mean there isnt a design flaw somewhere for every mass produced car has some flaw no matter how inexpensive or expensive however at this point there is a lot of hubris over it should i be purchasing an acura this would not be a factor check out their november 2002 issue page 82 their longterm testing as they put it it is good but not great and not worth the price and it does have its good points but unfortunately it doesnt have enough of them or it doesnt live up to its nameplate or its pricetag they pan the engine noise  power weight stereo sound lack of indash cd player clutch handling etc this article follows an earlier one 0902 issue in which they pointed out the xtypes many flaws and few virtues jagboyxtype if you want most other marques models you have to order vanilla maybe a chocolate or strawberry your xtype offers choice of automatic or manual and 25l or 30l engines is300 offers sportcross but only the 3 series offers so much more sedan coupe convertible wagon and ultrahigh performance models awd and rwd automatic and manual choice of engines is it bmws fault they are so wise to spread their costs across so many variants and give buyers so many choices i say you could also add z3 sales to the mix too oh thats too bad its also too bad that they failed to notice that the xtype does have an indash cdplayer which is standard on 30 litre models out of the group of european sport sedans eg bmw 3 mercedesbenz c audi a4 the jaguar x has the most powerful engines the jaguar alpine sound system is rated very highly the autos section of my newspaper rated the jaguar alpine system the top system out of premium european cars in a big comparison test of car stereos lexus won the japanese premium car sound system category with its ml system the car is a wonderful handler for example it outperformed the c320 sport in that deleted post comparison and although it does not have the classleading acceleration times it is only about 02 second behind the 3series and is in the top end of its class when it comes to performance 060 in 63 seconds  cardriver 060 in 65 seconds  roadtrack with its awd it can corner like no other car braking performance from 60mph is just two feet longer than the porsche 911 gt2 116 feet at 118 feet thus it stops in the same distance as a smaller bmw mroadster 118 ft brakes are from the larger stype connoly leather and wood are all standard in the jag and leather and wood are only optional if available in competors models it has the most rigid structure in its class over 30 higher than the previous class leader synthetic interior materials eg plastics and notleather softtouch areas are made by the same company from the same materials from the same machines that manufacture synthetic materials for audis a6 and new a8 which are industry leading according to many the xtype does weigh a little more than a rwd car as it carries an extra differential and drive shaft for its awd but that doesnt seem to hurt its performance it actually helps it in many ways also for instance it weighs less than an audi a4 cadillac cts and lincoln ls there is some engine noise entering the cabin but even wispers are still audible from passengers plus its a sportssedan so the engine is supposed to have a nice little note to it many reviewers have enjoyed the sound the xtypes engine makes there is also almost no wind noise as exterior mirrors etc were sculpted from windtunnel tests at pininfarina and highspeed tests on the nardo bowl in italy as well as the nurburgring in germany clutch yes some people dislike its feel yet others like it because it is not difficult to use i believe that it was motorweek that stated it felt like a bmw clutch pricing you can get a base xtype for around 29000  30000 with leather and wood manual transmission metallic paint etc option packages have been reorganized to allow more individual options to be ordered competators like the mb cclass sedan start at around 31000 without leather and wood but vinyl and plastic about the only virtue the xtype doesnt have are memory seats beyond those its one hellofa car i doubt it would still be making up 567 of jaguars sales and dominating an unheardof 66 of its market in europe especially italy if it werent a great car\\n______________________________________ on the acura transmission problems only 16000 cars have been afficted with the problem over the past two years according to the posted article accura sells a lot of cars so it does not seem to be a massive or widespread problem hopefully theyll fix it but i wouldnt worry about it too much jagboyxtype have you been reading what european car has been writing id encourage you to read their articles they have a web site i didnt write them please dont shoot me i just passed along what an interesting source said i happen to agree with many of their comments not all and i hope jaguar works aggressively to improve the xtype please dont shoot me i wasnt trying to shoot you you are just being paranoid i never even mentioned you in my whole response except for in the title where i was directing my message to what had been said that you passed along i said they as in the editors of european car but if you are now using the royal we and took what i said as directed towards you now you know that is not how it was meant i will shoot some words at you about improving the xtype however as i dont feel the car needs any improving at all except in a very few minor areas such as memory seats not that they are really needed but it would be a nice touch everything that makes a jag is there in the xtype and it is a great car on its own naturally jaguar will improve the xtype just as it improves all of its cars as for your fear of being shot at with words on this board perhaps you shouldnt say things that would cause you to get shot at if that is a fear of yours btw every month over 3000 people just in the us disagree with you and with european car about the xtype sorry buddy but youre in the minority on this one however european cars own final words on their xtype test were pushed to the limit and the xtype will gently push until you ease off the throttle muscled around the track however and its possible to slide the sedan until the tires melt great fun i came away from the xtype totally surprised i expected to find a meek and mild sedan but instead found a serious contender in the sportsedan market these first two offerings are greati cant wait to see what those rouges at jags r division have in store for the xtype why isnt audi considering shipping the a3 s3 here i belive theres a lot of market potential here in our shore it make perfect sense to have a a3 to battle against the benz c230 coupe and the bmw 320i i saw picture of the a3 and it look ok right now im considering to purchase an a4 30 i want to comapre the a4 30 and the s3 audi should ship the luxgolf here jagboyxtype ya gotta stay calm did you notice in your most recent post you did write over 3000 people just in the us disagree with you and with european car about the xtype have you even taken the time to read what european car has written or what mt and cd have previously written the xtype has gotten mixed reviews at best in america dont believe it has won a single comparison test see rts recent 11car sport sedan comparison think that says a ton when xtype falls short badly in comparison tests can you steer me to an american comparison test in which the xtype won and what do sales have to do with how truly good a sport sedan is i see a lot of people driving malibu taurus i30 es300 etc to many most people a car is either an appliance or a status symbol but it is only the rare few who are truly interested in all around performance some people might argue that low sales are a better indicator most people want cushy ride on interstate not 060 times or slalom results the is300 crowd might wear their low sales as a badge of honor jagboyxtype do you read mt or rt check out the november 2001 issue of motor trend mt pans the xtype 30 automatic in their 5car comparison in 10 areas of their report card the jag wins just one styling has last place or 2nd to last place rating in powertrain ride interior design seat comfortsupport rearcabin space trunk useability and value track results mediocre fourth place 060 mph time 2nd slowest slalom time worst braking result they tested a moderately loaded 43695 one check out the july 2002 issue of road  track rt pans the xtype 30 manual in their 11car comparison xtype comes in 10th overall 9th in just subjective ratings and 10th in just performance ratings they tested a loaded 46510 one does that mean you disagree with me european car rt and mt wonder if you and the other 3000 people are reading what is out there and test driving the xtype against its competitors isnt that comparo a little bit much i mean how does a almost a 12 second  throat raming or pummelling  i would expect the jaguar to be faster with a stick and the benz with an auto i have nothing against the xtype but that test is a little thick in my opinion one other thing who says the xtype has the most rigid structure in this class ive read that the c320 sport 330i and especially the a4 all have very stout structures this has also been my experience in driving all three of them m jagboyxtype check out the february 2002 issue of car and driver 7 car comparison xtype 30 manual came in 5th place woes included lack of overall performance poor ride quality poor brakes and poor skidpad xtype was tied for 2nd slowest 060 mph time 72 seconds longest braking distance 2nd worst skidpad result but did have the 2nd best emergencylanechange maneuver mph cds xtype was pretty basic with only a 39170 msrp notice the trend all the tested xtypes had stickers of 39000 and up and most publications harp that the jag fails to deliver the goods for so many dollars pushing 40000 does not seem to be entrylevel to me the xtype 25 is more the entrylevel jaguar how about the fact that it look like a ford contour yikes merc1 the xtypes structure is 30 more rigid than the previous class leader the bmw 3series you may check out autoweeks review of the car for that information as well as a review on the site autobytelcom and reviews conducted by autocar including their autocar book all about the xtype i never said that any of those cars you mentioned didnt have very solid and rigid structures nor did i try to imply that but at the moment the jaguar has the most rigid structure in its class also as riez would say i did not write the article the reviewers were the ones who said all of those quotes about the xtype beating the cclass in every part of that test and not just acceleration times take braking top drawer for the xtype or how they said the cars felt when being driven\\n____________________________________ riez i pity you because you only believe what car magazines tell you and you allow them to choose for you what is best instead of collecting your own information and actually checking things out for yourself listen to what youve been sayin car  driver said this and motortrend said this and road  track said this granted i have used their quotes and stats many times to back my own opinions as well which i even do here but youve taken it to an extreme do you read mt or rt you ask me\\nsometimes i do but only for entertainment purposes why because i do not trust them do not believe everything they say and only take what they have to say as their own human opinions and i am not the only one who feels that way abc news for instance did an investigation on the subject of car magazines being biased and omitting facts to suit their own interests they use the ford focus and cardriver and motortrends opinions of the car as an example for example in january car and driver listed the ford focus among its 10 best cars of the year it never mentioned that ford had recalled the focus eight times for various problems when that review was written one such recall was because the wheels would fall off of the car also just this month when motor trends review came out  no mention of the recalls or the fact that the government has five ongoing safetyrelated investigations of the focus it currently has six ongoing investigations but only five that motor trend could have known of when it went to press\\nhttpwwwabcnewscom hmmm six government safety investigations eight major recalls in its few years of production and the focus is a favorite among car magazines like cardriver and motortrend well they can have it and im sure you think its a wonderful little car since everything they say suddenly becomes law for you abc also mentions how certain car manufacturers that give allexpense paid trips to reviewers get higher scores and better reviews when the reviewers handle their cars even an auto reviewer interviewed in the article said there are other subtle ways that automakers try to woo the press motortrends own c van tune admitted to utilizing these perks from certain auto makers although his magazine has the resources to pay for these trips etc on its own the warning at the end of the article reads so far the big magazines dont seem to have changed their policies so be aware when you read and see reviews of this years models some of those reviews were written by reporters whove been fed and fueled by the car companies it can be expected that comparison tests would be especially succeptible to the effects of biases and perks from some automakers this is why you cannot believe and trust car magazines for anything more than entertainment and a very few facts have you even taken the time to read what european car has written or what mt and cd have previously written you also ask me yes i have european cars own review of the xtype is nothing short of pure flattery towards the car roadtracks review of the xtype is also very complementary cardriver tested the xtypes 0  60 time as just 63 seconds and raved about enthusiast goods of the car motortrend enjoyed the car very much and bought their own longterm tester of which they say this new x is one shaggy jaggy and im anxious to try out the upcoming r version of the xtype because this is a very good sport sedan autoweek liked the car and decided that x was definitely an addition to the a c and 3 in the sport sedan equation forbes wrote a very fine review of the car a vast majority of other reviews such as those at carpoint and autobytel are also complementary to the xtype and again autocar was so inspired that they created a minibook about the most important jaguar ever and said that between it and a 330i they dont know which one they would choose  its that close you mention american tests in your posts i must also ask you however why you believe that any reviews or comparison tests about the xtype from any other parts of the world are suddenly invalid they are all reviews how come only the ones you choose count there are people from all over the world here at edmunds are their views and opinions also invalid to you because they do not live in the same country as you do on the matter of that roadtrack 11 car comparison the reviewers say\\nso how you ask did a car as nice as the jaguar xtype end up second to last in this great big comparison test thats easy price\\nnotice that they happened to also have loaded their xtype with every option available on the car including such expensive items as the navigation system weather package and premium sound system etc yet other cars in their test were not fully loaded as the jaguar was the bmw for instance was lacking its navigation system and other items the mercedesbenz the second most expensive car in the group at 44949 also without its navigation system and lacking its premium sound system and in fact left without a cd player that no one seems to complain about not having in this car for this price where as the jaguar can take heat for having just a singledisc indash unit when not equipped with the 6disc changer a test with price included is not valid unless all cars are optioned out with the same equipment the xtype had much more than any of the other cars in the test did a better comparison for price would have been to compare base prices of the cars or prices of options or get this equip the cars similarly take note that both the saab and the mercedesbenz have higher starting prices than the jaguar and that the jags starting price is about 15002000 above most of the other cars in the test and that it comes standard with wood and leather which costs about 15002000 to equip on the other cars awd is also standard on the jag and extracost options on the cars that can have it equipped la continuedlater in that same rt issue they happen to have purchased out of all those cars a longterm xtype also on price lets not complain about the xtype when roadtracks 39804 and i count that as near 40000 wouldnt you bmw 330i does not even come with power seats in another comparo page 74 of their road test annual 2002 \\nso what else did rt say about the xtype in that 11 car test how about whether the chassis is redolent of jaguar tradition or not no one complained that it didnt work it feels like a modern wellbalanced sports sedan with excellent highway ride and good balance in the corners every time we got into a long stretch of fast curving mountain road whoever was in the jag inevitably got on the walkietalkies we all carry and said this thing is really good in the curves its a confidenceinspiring car with good grip linear steering and precise turnin the engine is not bad eitherour test cars optional 30litre 4cam v6 put out a respectable 231 bhp keeping it in this fast company with no particular effortoverall the xtype is a comfortable pleasent and useful car with a welldeveloped chassisits a good allrounder with probably just as much british charm as most modern drivers really want independent of price it scored in about the middle of our group in performance and subjective ratings as a side note they also say the jags interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures done up with nice details like the silverrimmed greenfaced gauges given its soft ride the xtype delivered surprisingly good handling httpwwwroadandtrackcom \\nand most of its other reviews have said pretty much the same things about the car as stated above good handling nice styling comfortable interior yeah there are some bad reviews but there are many many more good ones and it doesntt get panned as you have continually been repeating \\nlets also not overlook the top gear 2002 motoring survey in which over 37000 motorists were spoken to about 120 car models and 33 manufacturers the rankings for the entrylevel cars were 1 lexus is 200 2 jaguar xtype 3 bmw 3series 4 mercedesbenz cclass 5 audi a4 and a4 avant wagon 6 saab 93 7 volvo s40 and v40 wagon 8 alfa romeo 156 \\nthey had little quotes by some of the cars the xtypes read just past its first anniversary and the xtype enters the survey three places ahead of the bmw 3series out of the total 120 cars great dealer service few problems and good dynamics see to that \\nlets not argue here though riez we both have opinions and i simply dont agree with yours hostilities aside have a great day  __________________________________ \\ndpvwia2 \\nthe whole jaguarford thing died a long time ago xtype shares 6 points on its platform with the mondeo  not even its entire platform and it shares no body panels with any other car anyone could just as easily say that your a4 is just a jetta with four rings on its grille _________________________________ \\npat \\nsorry i thought that you had already deleted the post as it had not appeared on my page until i clicked on scroll up i had just assumed that you had taken care of it when i didnt see it load on the page i was at the xtypes structure is 30 more rigid than the previous class leader the bmw 3series i think the xtype still has a way to go as far as i go before i ever would consider one to be a class leader while you have a private debate going with riez  my two cents you buy what you buy for the reasons you buy but the trades and mags of barometers you have to read them understand where they intersect with your beliefs and opinions and take it from there in addition a 40k 330i is

fully loaded 45235 this was done at the bmw us website its a little higher than that 40k estimate of yours my point is not to single out the 3 for high pricing but to demonstrate that while a nicely equipped one can be had for around 40000 like any other car in its class it carries a high price when totally fully loaded this is my point about the xtype in the 11 car rt comparison a nicely equipped one similarly equipped with that 40000 3 in the test can be had for around 40000 but the editors instead chose to get a totally fully loaded one and then mark it down for a high price it wasnt quite fair totally fully loaded the mercedesbenz would have been the most expensive car in the test by quite a margin ever notice how the eclass starts at around 50000 but the stype and 5series start at around 42000 as far as class leaders go i believe that all of the cars in this class are very good and that they target slightly different groups xtype and cclass have more luxury than the others g35 and 3series are a little more performance oriented but all of them share many traits with slight variances in the degrees of those traits its nice to hear from you we havent talked for a while happy driving jagboyxtype i merely pointed out how when the american automotive press has had a chance to test the xtype up against its main competitors it falls flat pretty much every single american comparison test why do i bring up american tests because i cannot buy a eurospec xtype in america and many of the european cars a eurospec xtype is compared against in these tests arent even sold in america besides marques like fiat seat alfa lancia etc heck i cant even spell the french marques that are no longer sold in usa renault and peugueot been so long since since ive even seen an old frenchmarque car in my neighborhood so ensuring all the cars are usaspec is critical to a legitimate comparison and ive always loved the probrit bias in the english car magazines they do whatever they can to say nice things about english cars i leaf thru their mags at my local borders and barnes  noble the german press has raved about the underlying ford mondeo platform mondeo built in germany ive been subscribing to autoweek for over 10 years and i dont recall that issue if you know what issue that is in due tell i have hard time believe they did a specific testing of each of these cars structures to determine that the a4 is the one i felt was the most solid as far as that test goes i think it was basically set up to show up any weakness the c320 may havei dont think a 12 second is stomping anything into the ground and the jag should have been faster considering it was a manual beating the cclass at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isnt what the car focuses on primarily id be more impressed with a pumeling by the xtype of the 330i or is300 in those areas dont get me wrong i dont think the xtype is a bad car but that test had more than a twinge of bs to it m i dont know what car you speced out but its not my car i dont deem a nav system a must on a fully loaded car i am talking about leather sport and most high end options my 330i does not have sport nav or xenon but if i did it again i might have gotten sport to me its fully loaded because there is nothing else i wanted and i belive the navs are the biggest waste of money anyway if you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option thats your call people have different requirments for what they want in a car we have to be careful between comparing the msrp of fully optioned cars because most people do not order them that way the base 330i with leatherette can be had at ed for a mere 32000 btwnice to to talk to you as well kshapiro cant believe you did not get sport package that is almost heresy dont forget that bmws current nav system stinks just now finally moving to dvdbased system instead of cd but still most reviewers prefer systems used by other marques i think a mark 1 eyeball and a good map beats a nav system about 99 percent of time and the dash looks better without one imho they were interested in moving the carand i really like that car so i decided to take it well see what the landscape looks like the next time around merc1 go to httpautoweekcomsearchsearch_displaymvport_codeautoweekcat_codereviewscontent_code09870788search_typestdsearch_id609952record2 they say this particular partssharing it turns out only gives the jag its chassis hard points and its engine blocks but not much else jaguarites say the chassis itself shares only six small panels with its blueoval counterpart and that their version has been reinforced significantly for stiffness and quiet in fact they boast by the time the leaper hood ornament goes on the car its static rigidity is 30 percent better than that of the nearest luxury segment competitor by another measure body stiffness comes in at 22 kgdegree vs the 21 kgdegree recorded by the bmw 3 series a mighty fine measuring stick to use see they measured itb other reviews have noted that it has the most rigid structure in its class i can find them and post their urls if youd like if this review is not proof enough also if the link doesnt work because the site is a signin type go to autoweekcom and use their search box typing in jaguar xtype btw i do think that xtype v cclass review was also a little bsed however i believe all comparison reviews are either a little biased or include some bs as you can read about in my long posts a few messages away however you say beating the cclass at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isnt what the car focuses on primarily isnt the cclass supposed to compete with the is300 330i and xtype why is it that when the xtype does win excuses can be made for the other cars with they dont focus on those areas im willing to invalidate the transmissions in the this test as they were not totally evenly matched there but the xtype won out every other category of the test as well engine brakes ride i could just as easily say that the xtype doesnt focus on those areas either but no one would back me and it really is a poor excuse you also note that 12 second is not stomping anything to the ground yet in the roadtrack 11car test the xtype was just 06 second slower than the fastest car in the test and it was marked down for that we cant suddenly make an exception for this test i could say that the xtype doesnt focus on acceleration in the rt review but again that is a poor excuse if we choose to accept the rt 11 car test then we must by principle accept this test as well in those regards the xtype v cclass comparison was quite valid take care\\n__________________________________ riez i think ill terminate this discourse now that we have both had our say its just going to continue in a perpetual loop if we dont stop but i noticed that you still say the car falls flat and in all of those comparisons you have said yourself that price was a major factor in the cars losing points as well as rt cd and others noting that im just wondering if you read my really long message a ways back as i outlined how the xtype in all of those tests was outfitted much more heavily with options than any of the other cars and that its price would have been closer to the others had the xtype been outfitted with the same options as the others in the test also as merc1 notes 12 second differences etc are not large gaps being 06 second off from the fastest car in the test and 05 from the winning car is not falling flat by any means you seem to fail to notice actual measurements and what the reviewers write about the cars and instead only look at points and scores take note of the luggage space scores for the cars in the rt 11 car test for instance the xtype has a boot capacity of 160 cubic feet for that it received 78 out of 10 possible points in that category now look at the cadillac cts with a boot capacity of 128 cubic feet yet it received 84 points out of the 10 and it had a smaller boot the infiniti g35 has 148 cubic feet of boot space yet even with less space than the xtype it received the same score of 78 out of 10 the 330i with only 107 cubic feet of boot space received 76 points only 02 less point than the xtype with 53 more cubic feet than the 330i these ratios arent right and i cannot help but feel that their other points and scores must also be affected by these kinds of discrepancies i also still disagree with you about european or other comparison tests not being valid included in these tests are cars such as the xtype cclass and a4 et al that are sold in the us as well as cars that are not available here just because a car is not usspec doesnt mean the test is totally invalid in those other countries especially those tests are very valid as far as comparison tests go it is not a question of whether or not the test is valid just to you rather it is a matter of how valid the test is as a fair test thats where the problem is you are choosing which tests you want to acknowledge and which you simply feel like leaving out besides the difference between a usspec car and a nonusspec car is not going to come out in the test unless the car is crash tested or has an engine choice unavailable in the us etc you can get a general idea still and to simply say that because it is not a test conducted by an american magazine is a bit ignorant especially as all of these cars are global cars you also claim that english reviews have a bias towards british cars and that the germans also are biased however i have found that those two groups especially are very picky about cars and will tear a car apart worse than any american reviewer would dare to the british also have a thing for bmws  a german car  and ive not found a review where they had a bias for jaguar or any other british car and if they were biased and i missed it they certainly could not be any more biased than any american editors perhaps you have not noticed the bias that american reviewers have for german and japanese cars i believe edmunds stated something about their infatuation with everything german in a mercedes review and the idea that japanese cars are so much more reliable than any other cars is also overplayed to the point of now being a bias of american writers and dont attempt to say that im saying that japanese cars are not reliable now because they are im simply pointing out that there is an american bias of believing that they are tremendously more reliable than any other kind of car kdshapiro you said i dont know what car you speced out but its not my car i dont deem a nav system a must on a fully loaded car i am talking about leather sport and most high end options my 330i does not have sport nav or xenon but if i did it again i might have gotten sport to me its fully loaded because there is nothing else i wanted and i belive the navs are the biggest waste of money anyway if you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option thats your call thats exactly what i was trying to prove about the xtype in its tests take for instance the roadtrack 11 car comparo the xtype had every option available including the unnecessary navigation system and other equipment that the majority of other cars did not have it has been that way in almost every comparison test the editors choose a fully loaded as in every single available option xtype and then mark the car down for being expensive in comparison to competitors that are not fully loaded you are totally correct no one ever totally and fully loads out their car with every available option but the reviewers all do for the xtype in its comparison tests they dont for the other cars even that secondmostexpensivecar in the test c320 sport was still not fully loaded it didnt even have a cd player as i mentioned before in my other message in the magazines they depict the xtype as costing 46000 all of the time a base xtype 25 with standard connoly leather wood trim and manual transmission can be had at 29000 make the car a 30 litre model and you get everything in the base model plus standard indash cd player and other goodies and your choice of manual or automatic transmission at no extra cost for 35000 nicely equipped a 25 is usually around 33000 a nicely equipped 30 is around 38000 in my other message i wasnt trying to talk about your car i was using the 3series as an example of how in the tests theyll get a nicely equipped one at 39000  40000 but that the cars fully loaded price is 45000 just as they only showed the xtypes fully loaded price of about 46000 when one that is nicely equipped is between 38000  40000 just like the other cars okay i missed the point that particular car left nothing out in the options category most people do not buy a car like that jagboyxtype maybe well have something to discourse about when ford improves the future mondeo xtype such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class as it stands it just doesnt compete well as a serious all around sport sedan sure it has a big trunk but it also has a cramped back seat but i dont buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space and sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and spaceintruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multilink hinges oops think i meant to say when jag improves the future xtype  and ill really really start worrying about and paying attention to european magazine results when eurospec cars are sold here but today i can not even buy them think you should keep in mind that they often have many differences with their american counterparts eg safety equipment enginesthey love diesels transmissions and there are tons of marques in europe that are absent in america alfa fiat lancia seat renault peugeout skoda etc riez you missed the target again the trunk space example was simply an example of how the points awarded to certain aspects of the cars in the tests do not tell the whole truth as you misguidedly seem to believe the fact of the matter is that the xtype had more boot space than the other cars i mentioned and it recieved less points than they did and in an unbalanced ratio and that other scoring categories were similarly affected you also failed to notice the phrases for example and for instance leading into what i was saying in many cases if you believe that boot space was all that i was speaking about you said of the xtypes large boot and sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and spaceintruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multilink hinges from this i can tell that you never actually take the time to examine a car for yourself before passing judgement on it but instead rely completely upon little comparison test articles and your own assumptions as the xtype does have multilink boot hinges as opposed to the swanneck hinges on such cars as the xj8 and es300 ect that you assumed it had and then stated it had as if it were a fact but what can i expect from someone who finds himself clever at falsely mistaking a car for one with which it shares a few parts that cannot even be seen and on that topic in the global car world of today every car shares parts with another or many others for example if you miss it this time i dont know what to do bmw uses general motorssourced automatic transmissions and parts are shared with mini volkswagen and audi seat skoda porsche bentley lamborghini and bugatti all share many imany parts daimlerchrysler and mercedesbenz share some parts now too as well as sharing parts with hyundai and mitsubishi making fun of that seems well kind of pathetic  unless you have a weird sense of humor they share parts yeah  so what its not really relevant and as i noted about reviews and comparisons from other countries the cars do have some differences from usspec cars as you and i had noted that engines can be different etc but a general idea of the car can be had from those tests  as i had also said before in my other message quite often those tests even use the versions of the cars equipped with engines that are sold with them in the us as we generally have the larger versions of the engines available to us if its a dieselengine test they usually also have the whole test based upon that fact and will call it a diesel showdown or something else to that same effect again for now the second time you cannot simply invalidate a test because it was not conducted in america the cars we are disputing are not even built in america and many times the versions of the cars used in the tests are for the most part equivalent to their usspec versions alpha romeos fiats renaults and vauxhalls are not sold in america and thus i understand saying that for use in america their tests would be for the most part inconcequential but audis jaguars bmws and mercedes are all sold in the us as well as foreign countries and those foreign versions of the cars have little difference from their usspec versions as far as any test categories can gauge they never crashtest the cars in these comparisons and as c van tune pointed out in the abc article about how reviewers are fed and fueled by certain car manufacturers safety isnt an exciting enough category for these tests so to those reviewers who write about them it is irrelevant safety equipment is usually the primary difference between usspec and foreign versions of the same cars but thats not going to showup in one of these car comparisons because they are not comprehensive enough at all to measure such things yet its not just foreign articles that you are saying are invalid though you are just choosing the ones that back your arguement to the slightest degree which again just a display of your ignorance as well as the boothinge thing that you got wrong remember xtype has the multilink hinges with autoopening gas struts not swanneck hinges you also said that it had a cramped rear seat in comparison to its competators in comparison to a longwheelbase maybach it is cramped yes however it has one of the larger rear seats in its class not only is it larger than the bmw 3series rear seat as well as the is300s and a4s but it is also larger than the midsize 5series rear seat but ill admit not by that much compared to the 5 in posts in other sections of the town hall you defend how large the 5series rear seat is and how comfortable it is for adult passengers as far as roominess goes why do you call the xtypes rear seat  which is even larger than the 5s  cramped is this yet another assumption that you made about the xtype by now i am sure that you have noticed that i have continually refered to things in this message that i have already spoken about in my other two posts addressed to you a few messages back im wondering if you really even read them since your arguements are always the same and now youre even making outright assumptions no matter what i say and no matter how many facts i back my statements with you seem to have your eyes closed to them and dont even take them into account not only that but your statements are generally incorrect and your assumptions dont even touch on facts or reality and id say the best selling jaguar in history is competative when it makes up 567 of jaguars us sales and holds an astonishing 66 of the entrylevel to mid luxury segment in europe as well as over 70 of jaguars sales in its third largest market italy was your statement about being competative just another assumption on your part maybe well actually have a discussion when you start taking note of whats actually going on with the car and stop making assumptions and false remarks good day ok i read all that so im supposed to believe jaguars claim over what every other brand claims right until i see an independent test of all of the cars in this class structural rigidity ill go by what feels the most solid and it isnt the jaguar xtype so we disagree there\\nsecondly everyone knows full well that the cclass is not on the same plane with the 330i and is300 when it comes to being sporty to impress me youd have to beat those cars at all the track tests beating a c320 at the track isnt hard the is300 and 330i rule there that acceleration test will never count in my book because of the trans difference im not saying the comparison as a whole was not valid but i still maintain that they picked the areas in which the xtype would winout and lastly the xtype has been ranked below the c in every other comparo done if it were such a slaughter id think it would win some test over here too m jagboyxtype you should have more carefully read my post did i specifically mention the xtype trunk boot no i was discussing trunks in general and did you notice how i was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rearseat space should have much if any bearing when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedans do you harp on such little things regarding the xtype becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors when you get creamed on the track and street talk about the trunk i dont care about sales figures what do they prove if we used that wed all be driving a camry or accord 4cyl sedan as for euroland market keep in mind two huge facts currently about 40 percent of the cars sold there are diesels the hottest bmw is the 330id can i buy that in usa no and that over 80 percent of the cars sold there are manual transmission how many manual transmission diesel sedans coupes convertibles etc are sold in usa be willing to bet the figure is about zero ford europe and jag are rushing to get diesels into their europroducts riez again my point was that the boot space example was an example of how the points awarded in such comparison tests do not give real data points and scores are skewed  or whatever adjective you would use to describe awarding more space with less points in a category that is all about having more space and did you notice how i was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rearseat space should have much if any bearing when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedans yes i did catch that phrase the first time i read it however your argument against the xtype in you message before the last was that it had a cramped rear seat and had swanneck bootlid hinges  both statements that were false and now your latest statement that you did not name the xtype directly when speaking of such things as bootspace and rearseat room really is a weak coverup you stated maybe well have something to discourse about when ford improves the future mondeo xtype such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class as it stands it just doesnt compete well as a serious all around sport sedan sure it has a big trunk but it also has a cramped back seat but i dont buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space and sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and spaceintruding hinges that limit usability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multilink hinges oops think i meant to say when jag improves the future xtype your argument was that you do not consider rearseat room or trunk space when it comes to sportsedans because those are two areas in which the xtype excels if it had a small boot and a cramped back seat then you would be attacking the car for those two points then to further attempt to deride the xtype you state that large boots such as the xtype has often have spaceintruding swanneck hinges and odd opening shapes of course you did not have to name the xtype when making such statements  you implied it and did indeed name the car with the word it why even mention spaceintruding hinges if the xtype does not have them also paragraphically your topic was about the xtype and as those areas were spoken about there they are directly linked to the xtype however your arguments were wrong and to counter my catching of them being wrong you are now stating that you were not speaking of the xtype  a weak argument i dont care about sales figures what do they prove you constantly say that the xtype does not compete well against its competators sales figures and how much of the cars manufacturers sales the car makes are a direct indication of how well the car competes if the car did not compete well then it would in turn have low sales figures and most probably not make up much of its manufacturers sales the camry and accord 4cylinder are not in the entrylevel sport sedan class however in their own class it is generally accepted that they are very good cars also the ratio of new buyers of a new addition to an established market segment is an indication of how well the car competes and over 90 of xtype buyers are new customers to jaguar that means that it is taking sales from competators that compete in that market segment  thus it is competing very well if you have not gotten the fact that there are european comparison tests of cars that are sold here in slightly different forms but with the same engines as usspec versions then it is just a show of your unwillingness to be reasonable to any degree i have stated that those cars are not exact doubles of their us versions but the ones outfitted with gasoline engines that are available in the us and other such options are so much like their american versions that a comparison test is not going to be able to differentiate the two if there are differences measurable by the tests then you can take them into account however to invalidate the entire test is ignorant and unreasonable do you harp on such little things regarding the xtype becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors no i harp on such little things because you bring them up by making false assumptions which you present as if they were facts again i used those little subjects as examples to prove my points because facts are a necessity in presenting the truth you are the one who decided to harp on my examples also as i have stated and continue to have to remind you the xtype does not get beaten in the performance realm against competators examples the xtype completely won an allout performance test against the competing model from mercedesbenz the c320 sport it is a competing car then your soveryimportant roadtrack even states in acceleration the 30 xtype is among the quickest accompanied by a nicebutdistance exhaust note the jag goes from 060 mph in 65 seconds undercutting the boyracer lexus is 300s and audi a4s 71 mercedesbenz c320s 68 sec and matching the bwm 330is time and remember the xtype like the quattro loses a tick off the line because of a nowheel spin launch with allwheeldrive according to your precious magazines it also out brakes the porsche 911 gt2 from 80 mph and stops just 2 feet shorter than the 911 gt2 from 60 mph that is real performance and if you try to argue that down i believe i could safely say that it is a sign of a delusional mind perhaps you should stop simply reading my posts but should actually begin synthesising the data as well im having a hard time responding to much of the outrageously false statements youve made thus far you did get one thing right though jaguar is getting diesel engines ready for the european market as they do make up for much of a manufacturers sales there that was a weak point for the xtype it had no diesels to compete against the 330d etc with the high gasoline prices in europe rest assured that when the engines are available the xtype will compete even better than it already does so well and when im on the track ill remember to mention my cars boot to the porsche that i outbrake and to the is 300 a4 c320 that i out accelerate and the bmw driver that im deadlocked with even roadtrack took note of that merc1 other marques are not claiming that they have more rigid structures than the xtype has because they do not you say that youll go by what you feel feels more solid however i could just say that the xtype feels more solid to me and say that the discussion is over either way we cannot do that autoweek had the measurements for structure rigidity in their article and i even quoted them a little way back they also noted that the xtypes structure is 30 more rigid than the previous class leaders that means that the previous class leader no longer has the classleading structure in rigidity because the xtype now the class leader in structural rigidity beats it by 30 you are just choosing not to accept a fact as for the x v c article you say that they chose to test in areas where the xtype would win but then wouldnt other car media groups just be choosing areas in which the 330i wins the same can be said about any comparison look at what is said in these articles pointwise the cclass may win however in actual measurements the xtype beats it take for instance what roadtrack said about acceleration which i quoted above in my message to riez oh well we dont agree on this one at least you have an open mind enough to at least read the articles etc whether you choose to believe what is said is you choice have a nice day considering most manufacturers make improvements in rigidity on the scale of 50 to 100 percent when they do a platform update 30 sounds at least a little reasonable lets get pluskin in here he should know and if not he should be able to find out i would trust him more than any hearsay in this forum betcha cant get a jag bmw or audi with a thong holder  i havent heard from pluskin in awhile they double their rigidity with every platform update since its you telling me i believe you but that kinda boggles the mind one would think theres a point where you cant go beyond chris omgyou guys actually read through all that how ironic the one car they couldnt have known about yet was the a4 it came out after the jag by a few months if the bmw 330i was the class leader dont you think the new a4 surpassed it too landing it squarely at the jags level or beyond as for the x v c article you say that they chose to test in areas where the xtype would win but then wouldnt other car media groups just be choosing areas in which the 330i wins i agree there weve had this conversation before car and driver is most guilty of this agreed their last comparo was seemingly decided on how the 330i handled mountain roads something most people dont drive on in my opinion road and track conducts about the fairest comparos i always willing to read and listen hence our actual debating and not outright arguing that said its been another fun one m i know that the a4 is 40 more rigid than the previous a4 but i dont know what its actual measurements are it being more rigid than the xtype has not been mentioned in any reviews that i have seen as of yet so i cannot say that the car is more rigid than the xs structure in many reviews the editors have stated that the xtypes structure is the class leader in measured rigidity and as many reviews have concluded this i accept the fact if the measurements of the a4s rigidity came out and proved to be higher than the xtypes then i would accept that however at this moment the xtype is known as the most rigid car in its class this is not to say that the a4 has not surpassed the 3series in rigidity or possibly the xtype or to say that the car or any of the cars in this class are lacking in structural rigidity it is simply to say that with the information available all current measurements have proven the xtype to be the most rigid to this day i always willing to read and listen hence our actual debating and not outright arguing yes thank you for being that way it makes discussion so much more pleasant when two people can actually debate without losing total respect for each other and resorting to primitive argumentative states you always review the information presented and can thus make valid statements as you said its been another fun one keeping open minds makes life so much more enjoyable btw  have you read about the recall on the g35 well until either of us run across the a4s chassis figures i guess neither of us can say anything either way huh im a gambler and im betting the a4 is stiffer plus that that was only review of the xtypes structure i dont recall reading that it has the stiffest structure by any publications on this side of the pond other than autoweek i havent read anything about the g35 i simply dont like the car m well in any case we dont know the exact figures for any of the cars in quantitative terms so we cannot make a complete judgement however what i can judge with relative certainty are the crash test results for the x type 3 series c class and various other models which is related to structural stiffness and design from these results httpwwwhwysafetyorgvehicle_ratingscehtmlsummary_midluxhtm and httpeuroncapcomratingsphp3idlarge_family_carsorder1 i am pretty certain that the c class has the best designed structure in its class with the jag being behind the 3 series and the a4 the c class was one of only 2 cars in the euroncap test to get a full 5 star rating and the c class is the highest rated midsize luxury car according the insurance institute the intrusion and deformation ratings are as follows httpwwwhwysafetyorgvehicle_ratingscehtmlgrey_midluxhtm anyway if i had a choice on any of these cars id save up my money and get an e class but thats my personal opinion actually stiffness mainly determines how much a cars twists during quick handling maneuvers\\nwhereas occupant protection arises from engineering to divert kinetic energy from the crash into crumple zones and away from the main passenger cabin the challenge is actually to get the stiff but crushable compromise correct so stiffness equals good handling more than occupant protection actually this isnt the xtype we have here in the us this is the xtype section of the car crash test above \\nhttpeuroncapcomdetailsphp3idcar_117_2002 \\ntake note that this is the jaguar xtype 20 lhd marked under the make model and hand of drive portion of the chart at the bottom of the page the xtype 20 is the lowend europeonly version of the car that lacks the extra driveshaft that the 25 and 30 litre models have that are sold globally as well as the driveshaft that is found in the 3series and cclass thus its crash tests produce weaker results than the 25 and 30 versions and 3series and cclass because 20 is a fwd car with no longitudal driveshaft that is found in awd xtype and rwd cclass 3series cars \\ncheck out this site \\nhttpwwwhwysafetyorgvehicle_ratingscehtml0210htm \\nit notes that the xtype underwent structural changes after december 2001 but does not say if that was a versionspecific change which i discovered it was a letter to consumer reports aided research and their reply was as follows \\nwe spoke with jna jaguar north america on this question and they explained that the jaguar xtype was originally introduced in europe as a 20 litre fwd front wheel drive model the only models sold in the us are 25 and 30 liter awd versions that achieve better frontal crash test results than the fwd european model due to a prop shaft that runs the length of the car from front to rear the prop to the rear supplies power to the rear wheels as well as the front which accounts for the awd traction the modifications made and referred to in iihss report on xtypes made after december 2001 were actually modifications made to fwd european models and are not applicable to the us awd models thanks jagdude and consumer reports for this information \\nalso note that the reason why the cclass recieved a 5star rating in the european test over the 4star rating that all of the others in this class recieved was because it was the only car that had a flashing light that litup a sign reading the equivalent of fasten your seatbelt on its dash which is to become a standard feature in europe in the future it would have recieved that same 4star rating had it not had the light this is straight off the site \\nextra points awarded for the way that the cclass reminds its passengers to buckle their seat belts have now made it the second car ever to gain a fivestar crash protection rating results for the cclass were published last year and it achieved four stars but euro ncap has since changed its scoring system to encourage car makers to fit seatbelt warnings \\nall in all id feel very safe in any one of the cars in this class and i do feel safe being in one of them stay safe everyone i honestly cannot remember a car ive been in that hasnt had a seatbelt warning light our 87 mercedes 420 sel had it and my 99 honda prelude has it maybe this is due to european influence as the focus originally introduced and designed in europe has an obnoxious system that beeps and chimes if the driver does not fasten within an allotted amount of time and other cars ive been in have sensed the weight of a passenger and have flashed the seatbelt light as well i believe the landcruiser does this however as the seatbelt usage stats are dropping in the us maybe this is a good idea after all i can personally attest my safety and my mothers life to seatbelts btw jagboy the euroncap xtype was a 2002 and it stated that the fwd 20 was released march of that year which is supported by both car and top gear magazines british publications in addition i am relatively certain that the xtype was introduced as an awd model to differentiate it from the mondeo and to keep it from alienating jag owners who may have cringed at the thought of a fwd jag this is from a car article soon before the xtype itself was introduced in may of 2001 however as the base 25 is an already relatively expensive car and does not fare well against a c180 or 318i in terms of value jag decided to introduce the fwd 20 with a stick as standard from what i understand the driveshaft does assist in distributing the crash impact rearward however the larger engine block of the 30 tends to push rearward earlier in an accident than the smaller block of the 20 with its fewer driveline components obviously as it is fwd so the crumple zones of the 20 have more room to crumple i believe this is the reason why mercedes decided to replace the 32 inline 6 of the e class with the smaller block of the 32 v6 in 99 and the difference in crash test scores between a 97 and a 00 are pretty significant although im not sure if mercedes conducted any significant changes to the structure since they lowered the hood by an inch they double their rigidity with every platform update since its you telling me i believe you but that kinda boggles the mind one would think theres a point where you cant go beyond wellyes theoretically speaking there is a point where you cant go beyondbut nothin on the face of this earth that has a perfect structural rigidity we are talking about a large structure on the scale of 100s of centimeters which carries payloads of about 1000 pounds and is subject to stresses incurred by hard braking and acceleration and cornering not to mention the constraints that mass production places on structural rigidity there is still a lot of flex in even the most rigid of automobiles even full out race cars have problems from structural rigidityi believe the initial audi r8 had multiple problems with body flexparts of the body would pinch and snap hoses and electrical lines so yes there is tons of room for improvement in all cars in the area of rigidity yes my xtype also has a seatbelt warning light in the dash most all cars do in addition it chimes at you when you do not have your seatbelt on and it has sensors in the seats that measure how much the occupant of the seat weighs and more sensors determine how far the occupants are from the dash and steering wheel so that it can calculate how much force to use when firing airbags in the event of a collision a small amber light in the corner of the wood veneer on the passengers side lights up and displays whether the occupant there weighs enough for the airbag to be automatically turned on or off and the seats automatically also turn off the airbags if a baby or childseat is detected the warning system in the mercedes cclass in that test was a different light from the ones we have in our cars here notice that the cclass had scored a 4star rating in the test just as all of the other cars in that class did but because of the addition of another light that said put on your seatbelt the cars score was later changed to a 5 to promote more lights that say put on your seatbelt to be used in other cars im not saying that the c does not deserve a high rating in crash tests but its additional star over the other cars in its class is simply because it has an additional light that tells passengers to wear their seatbelts on top of the light on the dash that says to wear your seatbelt it is not necessarily safer than the other cars because of that light and so i do not believe that it should have gotten an entire extra star for a light \\nyou are also wrong about the 30 jaguar engine pushing into the cabin in a crash before the 25 and 20 because they are the same engine blocks but the 30 has been drilledout more to be larger also the engines do not enter the cabins at any time in a crash because the xtype is designed to drop its engine when it is in a severe frontal crash most modern cars do this xtypes engines are also mounted horizonatally so they are not taking up a terrible amount of longitudal space in the engine bay thus the chances of them penetrating the passenger cabin is slim in comparison to longitudally oriented engines again however the xtype drops its engine when it has a severe frontal crash so it never enters the passenger compartment no matter what engine size is used the argument that a 20 fwd xtype would be safer than an awd larger displacement version is null and void because the engine does not enter the cabin at any time during any impact \\nyou really should read the bottom chart of the euroncap page for the xtype \\nhttpeuroncapcomdetailsphp3idcar_117_2002 \\nit specifically states that the car is jaguar xtype 20 lhd only the fwd xtype is built with the 20litre engine which again is the same engine block as the 25 and 30 but not drilledout as much all other xtypes are built in awd configuration the awd driveshaft of the awd xtypes aid in collisions v the fwd version that is sold alongside them in europe against 318 and c180 \\nmercedesbenz decided to changed to a v6 from an i6 because they lowered the bonnet of the eclass between those configurations and could not fit the i6 under the lowered bonnet as well as because it may have cost less to produce and it could be used in more vahicles as it had better packaging that is also the reason for the discontinuation of the e300 diesel as the diesel engine could not fit under the lowered bonnet that was used when the v6 was introduced that and because the e300 did not sell well here the eclass should have been designed to drop its engine in a crash as well ive not heard of a modern car being designed so that its engine penetrates the passenger compartment in a collision while the cclass did gain an extra star because ncap changed its guidelines earlier this year on performance in crashes and safety features provided the c class did earn its full 5 stars as its a very well designed car collisionwise when i can find the article in which ncap justified giving the c class an extra star bc of its overall performance ill paste the link as the pre 2003 e class also includes this seatbelt light your logic would conclude that it too should receive 5 stars from its previous 4 when it doesnt the fact that car engines are not designed to go into the passenger compartment is obvious what isnt as obvious is while the xtype is designed to as you describe drop its engine and driveline components they will always push into the compartment as evidenced by the insurance institutes listing of the crash details in which the xtype exhibited moderate footwell intrusion between 8 to 12 cm the best rated c class on the other hand had intrusion measures of 2 to 3 cm engineers are constantly trying to limit this phenomenon while i dont doubt the driveshaft aids in crash test scores i wasnt trying to prove one way or another i was speculating on a possible alternative and while i may be wrong on the engine block of the 20 being different from the 25 and the 30 i am certain that the e class hood and front fender structures were lowered as a result of the new engines newfound underhood space and not due to the new engines being introduced bc of the lowered hoodline this is evidenced by the 99 e320 having the v6 with the prefacelifted hoodline the discontinuation of the e300 in the uss was caused by the low demand for that particular car and bc of the structural change however that never meant that mercedes dropped diesels from its complete linup in fact europe still has the option of a few remarkable diesel e class engines which mercedes could have introduced here along with the redesigned 2000 e class speaking of mercedes and safety i think this wrecked s430 says it all httpgermancarfanszeroforumcomzerothreadid1698 \\nm note how the cabin is completely in tact amazing m i have seen 3 mercedes cars in accidents where the cars were totalled two of which were rollover accidents one of the rollover accidents was an s430 and it had a mild cabin protrusion but nothing serious the cabin was in perfect shape basically the other was i believe a 600sel this one was extremely important because even though this car had pillarless windows the roof of the car did not cave in at all even though the car came to a rest upside down the guy was still in the car at the time and he was hanging upside down with no visual bruises and a few minor cuts from broken glass the third accident was an e320 which was involved in a head on collision with a camaro who was racing another camaro on a 2 lane road i didnt see the drivers but i saw the car as it was being towed away and again no cabin protrusion at all the car was completely destroyed up to the point where the footwell started im generally dont praise late model mercedes but i will always say glamorous things about them when it comes to safety in my opinion they are a few steps above volvo they also have some of the strongest roof structures short of a 3 thick roll bar ill say it up front i dont think edmunds does a consistent job on sedan reviews i understand the whole theyre in bmws payroll thing as well as the but were not thing this months letters to the editors  edmunds responses make good points on both sides unfortunately edmunds does a fabulous job of putting numbers to their words that later can be dug up and compared im specifically looking at the entry level luxury sedan comparos  2001 where a tls edged out a 330i then 2002 where a 330i wiped the floor with the competition the idea and some will agree while others disagree is that the scores tended to deliberately put bmw above the acura is this happening well i decided to look at the numbers behind the comparisons to find out given identical cars whereas the two were eventually matched on performance in 2001 now there is a 20 point spread between them in 2002 what acura got slower or bmw got faster given identical front seat comfort in 2001 now for 2002 bmw front seat comfort is tops while acuras is bottom did the seats actually change or did the editors of the 2002 review have smaller rumps not that only acura gets the shaft either in 2001 bmw got a higher feature content rating than the tls in 2002 a 330i with more features than the 2001 model only tied the feature content rating than a tls with the same features this in spite of the fact that features the 330i lacked in 2001 dual zone climate control indash cd changer were simply left off the top 10 features list in 2002 leaving bmw as a vehicle that offers every top 10 feature as either standard or optional basically i like the prose of the articles and take away many good things from reading them when i look at the rankings though they seem to be statistically invalid if twelve months later your opinions on identical seats can change that much then how can you rank these cars based on 1 differences in the final rankings in one of the comparos it was stated that the margin for error was about 05 and any two cars tallying numbers within 5 of each other would be considered tied i suggest increasing that buffer to 10 in order to account for the startling differences you find between two cars after just one year until then im going to stop reading into the numbers and ranking and concentrate on the prose and photographs we spend a great deal of effort arguing here about which sedan came in 1 and which one came in 2 if you look at the numbers used to actually rank these vehicles against each other they fluctuate so wildly from one set of editors to another youd think that using a set of editors would even out the fluctuation so as to make the ranking of these vehicles practically worthless front seat comfort\\n2001 acura 83 bmw 83\\n2002 bmw 92 acura 76 rear seat comfort\\n2001 bmw 74 acura 70\\n2002 acura 92 bmw 58 conclusion either bmw and acura received total redesigns in 2002 unbeknownst to all of us or the editor buttometer does not produce repeatable results i was noticing how the hood ornament was still standing  anyhow all i can say is that mercedes still rule in crashes about seat comfort my theory is seats are mass produce by suppliers and sometimes maybe precision of making the seats can run off track who knows probably the reason they were not as comfortable in acura in 2002 as was in 2001 dont know how to go about that one j caddylac did you mean the 600sec coupe the reason im asking is because you said it had pillarless windows the sedan 600sel has pillars m yeah i know it was pillarless i all could conclude for sure was that it was a v12 and it was a pillarless coupe that v12 looks huge from underneath the car i can personally vouch for the excellent performance of benzes in collisions my mom had a gray market 1981 500 sl that was broadsided at a perfectly 90 degree angle to her car at 40  50 miles an hour she walked away with no serious injuries just some muscle tension and whiplash the other car was totalled and although the side of the car was basically crushed in the passenger compartments space was maintained in addition the door would still open and close normally and she was able to amazingly drive it home i remember how thick the doors on the dallas era sls were amazing took 30000 to fix it and even then it was never the same we also had a 1987 420 sel that was rear ended by a pontiac bonneville at approx 25 mph and the pontiacs front was pretty damaged to about the front wheels our benz on the other hand suffered little more than scrapes along the length of the bumper but no structural damage the bumper wasnt even displaced at all just wanted to share with everyone that after those things happen to you brand loyalty takes on a whole new meaning typical german engineering i was in an 01 golf that a yahoo in a huge pickup broadsided at 40 no intrusion into the passenger compartment at all just wanted to share with everyone that after those things happen to you brand loyalty takes on a whole new meaning of course it goes both ways many years ago in my first ever car a 1988 ford taurus that i loved to death i was rearended while sitting at a red light by an almost brand new mercedes eclass he had some bumper damage and the front hood was a bit bent in contrast my taurus was destroyedi was slammed into a buick in front of me and half the engine bay and almost all of the trunk were completely collapsed to the dearly departed tauruss credit there wasnt any cabin intrusion and i only bruised my shins but the car was totaled while the benz probably picked up a thousand dollars worth of body work ill never forget the mercedes dude getting out of his car and bending over to keenly examine his slightly crunched bumper while i stared at my utterly destroyed car on a more positive note that was the last ford i ever owned whew in conclusion mercedes sedans are notable not only for their defense but for their offense as well if i were looking to take out dodge neon drivers literally id pick a s500 as my instrument of mayhem if youre looking to drive while combing your hair talking on the cell phone and changing radio stations at the same time but do not want to sit in a ford expedition then an eclass may be for you am i correct in hearing there have been some recent problems with the trannys on these cars am comparing them between the 530 and gs 300 any idea on a manual dzuba  the word on the street is yes but i also heard that the stock market is about to rocket away and buy some good dot com stocks trying to ferret out the truth as whatever the truth is very difficult although some people say yes consumer reports highly recommends this auto about two percent of hondas five speed manumatic transmissions have failed according to detriot news honda issued a recall for these transmissions httpwwwedmundscomnewsregularnewsarticles75418articlehtml \\nthe recall doesnt affect most recent 2003 tls so supposedly it has been fixed in production 2 percent amounts to 12 million cars they do sell a lot of cars they may sell a lot but i dont think they sell 51 million tls a year chris the way i understand it is that they will send extended warranty to all owners who purchased the car model with questionable part thats the 12 million the 2 i believe is the approximate percentage of 12m cars reported to have problems approximately 12000 cars i misinterpreted where the 12 million number came from oops chris ah this reminds me of word problems in math class long ago yeah the 2 was the estimated number of these autos with actual transmission failures the 12 million is the number of autos that have the potential to be affected in the future and thus get an extended warranty also the cars affected span up to 3 years of production you guys want to try another word problem from everything ive read the percentage of affected trannys is 16 so how many cars is that j d power  nonpermissible content removed gives the tl its highest rating for long term reliability as does consumer reports transmission problems dont seem to be showing up in their research is this problem overstated or is their research flawed its definitely not overstated there have been widespread reports and complaints about all of the affected vehicles for a long time within the hondaacura community its nice to see the cars getting coverage finally although i know a lot of honda prelude owners who are upset that the recallfix wasnt extended to 9799 owners who to my knowledge were the first group of sequential sportshift owners to start having their transmissions die on them i am in outside sales driving 3035k miles per year my major concerns in a car are ride comfort luxury and reliability then they are style sportiness etc  anyone out there driving a tls 30000 miles a year and if so  how has the car held up my 98 maxima gle is flawless i think that honda willingness to extend the tranny warranties demonstrates their commitment to customers if they still have not fixed all the transmission problems then im sure they will continue to try i see your concerns though because the extended warranties only covered 100k miles as a nissan maxima owner have you considered the infiniti g35 sedan from nissans luxury division if so i would be interested in hearing your thoughts on the relative merits of it and the acura tls i dont think honda issued any recalls for the tranny at least none of the tl owners have heard of such however the problem is real i myself had a tranny failure at 6100 miles right when i entered a busy highway from a full stop pushed the gas pedal the engine revved into the redline and the car barely moved forward add the view of a couple of semis in the rearview mirror to all the excitement \\nthe dealer replaced the tranny it only took a couple of weeks to order the new one during that time i had pleasure of driving a rental dodge stratus \\nsome people have had multiple tranny failures \\ncheck the acura tl and acura cl forums for more info \\nhttpwwwacuratlcomforumforumdisplayphpsforumid34 \\nhttpwwwacuraclcomforums ooo that must have been exciting what happened to your gtp chris gtp lease ended in december 2001\\nwife got an rx300 instead audi a4 the model with memory seats and mirrors has a malfunction as a selling point the two remote keys can be assigned to two different seat and mirror positions so if husband or wife open the car with their keys the seat and mirror can restore to hishers position the bug is the right mirror can not be restored the bug makes this big selling point useless since you need to push the button to restore the position anyway and it is a potancial danger since you are easily ignore the right mirror until you are on the road then try to push the button on the door i struggled with this problem for my new 2002 a4 30 for nearly 1 year talk to dealer audiusa and audiusa field rep many times about half year ago the field rep let me stop complaining and tell me it will be fixed in 2003 model but now it turned out it still not functional in 2003 model and i was told they just do not think it will be fixed and i should treated it as work per design it is horrible for audi not to fix such an apparent problem for such a long time and looks like there is no way certain level of decisionmaker can hear customer146s voice a reporter is looking for consumers who have bought an entryluxury car  under 30k eg bmw 3 mercedes ccoupe jag xtype audi a4 etc in the last year ideally buyers who were new to the luxury brands to talk about how they like their cars and why they bought them the 30k isnt a hard and fast rule though it\\nwould be nice please contact jfallonedmundscom if interested thanks actually im looking into getting a car in this class again im thinking that my top cars are the g the x type and the c230 sedan i like all three but im having trouble making a final decisionplease help im thinking one factor worth considering is where you live if it snows where you live the x type is where you want to be have you driven any of them cjs2002 what are your criteria what is important to you are you looking more for luxury or for performance do you need awd do you want rwd do you want automatic or manual transmission what is your price range id strongly recommend you do a ton of research and a lot of test driving start with the acknowledged leader in this segment the bmw 3 series then expand out to those cars that meet your needs criteria and price short list of cars you should consider bmw 325i and 330i\\nlexus is300\\ninfiniti g35\\nmb cclass\\njaguar xtype\\nlincoln ls\\ncadillac cts\\naudi a4\\nvw passat\\nacura 32tl\\nacura tsx\\nsaab 93\\nvolvo s40 and s60 also check out chrysler 300m especially the special version well ive started researching many of these vehicles actually ive been researching them and for starters i detest bmw 3 series there are too many of them and i feel that they are priced too high for what you get as for lux vers sport im sortta torn im thinking id like a little more refinement but i doo need to have some get up and go to the car since i drive mostly highway as for conditions well i live near cleveland ohio and winters on some days can suck horribly but not nearly as bad as in the direct snowbelt like clevland ive had a rwd ford explorer in the winter and find drivin just fine so i dont think that a rwd car will be much different i like the jag x type but the 25 is rather underpowered when matched with an auto and for info i dont do manuals never learned how too tryin to see if i can get a deal on a base 30 s type and go from there i just took a drive in a 04 cts and like the power of that car just fine but the interior seem rather plasticky i drove the g and find that yeah while ill admit to it having some cheap looking parts it balances out nicer than the cts i also drove a mb230 sedan and like that as well but just have some concerns for one its the smallest or at least feals the smallest when you compare them allso i dont know and oh yeah dont like audis either lol sorry they just dont appeal to me not for the pricewell post more info latter thankx for all the help i really appriciate it and one last question driving in winter isnt so bad with a rwd car as long as you have snow tires i mean if its horrible blizzard conditions i dont go out anyways i just wanted your comments on it cjs2002 since youll only go automatic transmission i would not recommend the following combinations as they are sluggish in comparison to alternatives within the marque or the upengined model 325i auto esp heavier awd version\\ntsx auto uses small 24l i4 that needs high rpms for power\\na4 18t auto esp heavier awd version\\nxtype 25 auto made heavier by standard awd\\nmb c230 esp heavier awd version noticed you left one car off your comments lexus is300 you should take one for a spin my wife loves her is300 automatic if you are considering the cadillac cts you should also look at the lincoln ls6 lincoln dealers are really discounting these fine cars most cts ive seen at two local cadillac dealers tend to be loaded up with 57k worth of options hard to find one near 30k if you want powerful car and dont mind fwd you might consider acura 32tl infiniti i35 nissan maxima se or nissan altima 35se jag stype is not normally considered near luxury thinking its base price starts in the low 40000s and quickly moves up with options if you can afford this you might consider bmw 5 series 525i or 530i or lexus gs300 have you looked at 300m yet they are very nice i drove one for 3 years lease and it was great i still miss it 300m is not a 060 sprinter but it is quite powerful and it turns very well a lot of space inside nice luxury touches im glad you have decided to buy something other than a 3series i find it easier to do head to head than try to compare groups g35 vs c240 best budget rwd from across a pond\\n04cts vs 03ls8 best america has to offer\\n03i35max vs o3tls best fwd on a budget\\n04tl vs 04 95 best fwd\\n04 s60r vs xtype 30 not sure theres any real awd competition under 40k some of these autos 03 tls ls8 i35 are great bargains compared to original list but its no deal if you are unsatisfied just a thought  the mb that im talking about is the c 230 kompressor sedan its different than the 240 but has more hp i dont know what to do sorry but the is to me seems like a cheap camry with a lexus logo feal free to add more info and lend a hand i appriciate it all cjs2002 you wrote but the is to me seems like a cheap camry with a lexus logo there is no comparison between these two entirely different platforms are you confusing the is300 with the es300330 the es is fwd v6 and based on the camry platform the is300 is rwd i6 based on the toyota altezza the is can be had with manual and automatic transmissions the is300 also has a sportcross touring station wagon version is could use some more hp interior is kind of weird for my taste around the gauges es does look like camry it is basically a camry actually the es body looks a bit bloated with too much overhang on the sides sorry about the comparison i know they arent the same i was just comparing them to show what i thought of them ive never liked the is lexus now as to the es300 and 330 i like but they are out of my pricerange especially when equiped the same as the others ive been looking at thank you for your help though im slowly narrowing down my car choices i started with a list of nearly 20 and cut it down as for the 300m they are ok but well nothing against chrysler yeah its spelled wrong but ive heard that the drive trains and transmitions in the 300ms are terrible but maybe that was just when they first came out  i dont know but those stories just turned me off to that car as for a 5 series bmw well i love that car esspecally the new desighn yet i dont think i can lease one or well i dont know if i could or couldnt  i have no idea as to how well they lease my max payment is 300 and then thers another 250 from parents on top of that but id rather not have a 450  500  lease payment but i dont know any suggestions any one know what a 5 series or even a base mb e class leases for just wondering thank you all very much cjs2002 you have me thoroughly confused are you in the under 40000 range or not at post 198 you wrote tryin to see if i can get a deal on a base jaguar 30 s type and go from there the jaguar stype competes with audi a6 bmw 5 series and mb eclass then at post 205 you write now as to the lexus es300 and bmw 330i i like but they are out of my price range how can these two cars that are less expensive than a jaguar stype be out of your price range if you can buy or lease a jaguar stype you could certainly buy or lease an es300 or 330i then you also write i have no idea as to how well they lease my max payment is 300 and then there is another 250 from parents on top of that but id rather not have a 450  500 lease payment but i dont know what you can afford to lease is way different than what you can buy you should check out the various lease deals jaguar xtype leases heavily subsidized seen some inexpensive rates with 3 series i had a 300m for 3 years and  no problems id say that most 300m drivers that i know of have not had any problems especially with the drivetrain i leased a 2002 acura tls and the tranny failed after 6100 miles go figure lol sorry for the confusion everything im looking at is based on how it will lease and yeah im leasing what ever car i may get then so i know my max payment is about 500 for a lease mind you not a buy i just wanted to know if at least im pretty shir that the x the g35 and the c230 all lease for under 500 but i dont know about say a e class i hope i dont confuse you what im trying to get at is that if stepping into say a e class isnt much more expensive than getting a c in terms of lease payments then would it be better to lease an e over the c i dont know im not the one who handles the money factor and negotiations my father negotiates it to with in my budgette and then i just pay it no questions askedlol sounds dumb but oh well yeah my main cars that im looking at id half to say is below the 35k range actually below the 33k sticker range cause then my father can negotiate the final prices once again sorry for anyconfussion im just rateling off possibilities befor i make the final plunge into buying  wait let me correct that  leasing my own car thank you all cjs2002 not sure what to make pulled up your profile the car i am shopping for is a 2003 nissan altima and the car i own now is a 1992 buick lesabre huge difference between an altima and an eclass even bigger difference between nearly every car weve talked about an a lesabre let me know what you end up buying best thing for you to do is serious test driving and crunch your lease deal numbers ive been really pleased with the a4 with quattro awd i have the 30 with the tiptronic automatic transmission and live and work in the cleveland area the 18t is a nice car but the weight tends to make it sluggish it can be improved with aftermarket performance products chip exhaust etc but would bring you up in price to the 30 the a4 30 has one of the nicest interiors around i also do mostly highway driving and the interior combined with the performance handling makes this a pleasureable ride in winter the quattro system really shines ive been able to drive through some nasty snowstorms over the past 2 years and ive always felt under control wherever i was going audi also has a 4 year  50000 mile service program that covers all service at no cost to you with that along with the 4 year  50000 mile warranty all youll spend is for gas and tires if needed with the 2004 models now appearing on the lots you can make a good deal on any remaining 2003s just some insight from a fellow cleveland driver  good luck in your decision i had many problems with my g35 sedan but the brake padsrotor problem tops them all i was due for front brakes quite early imo but that is another story the service representative told me that my rotors are warped and i need to pay to replace the rotors according to many sources dealers and infiniti customer service most of the g35 require rotor replacement in addition to costly brake job infiniti knows about the problem and is not paying for the rotors be prepared to buy yourself a new set of rotors for every brake job and you will need this quite often to the delight of your local dealer unfortunately i was one of the early victims and did not expect that the car will be so bug ridden as it is i would never buy this pos knowing what i know not but is too late it is by far the worst car i ever had for 16 months i have been to a dealer 12 times let prospective buyers be aware post your message on the infiniti board let buyers and owners beware billyperks  he did  several of them there are too many of them and i feel that they are priced too high for what you get  im not sure which of these mass produced cars are actually rare on the road all of these cars have sporty rides with some leaning more towards performance than others but this would be my short list bmw 3 series  if i wanted the benchmark\\nlexus is300  cr rates this cars drivetrain almost as good as the 3series and as riez points out is has lsd\\ninfiniti g35  stripper version almost the least expensive of the bunch\\nlincoln ls  i would question the reliability of these\\ncadillac cts  should be awesome with its new engine\\naudi a4  all around nice car\\nacura 32tl  for a sporty sedan this would be at the top of the list\\nacura tsx  nice for a people without families\\nmazda 6  not withstanding the rust issue that seems to be on edmunds boards the 6 goes head to head with the tsx although the tsx has more upscale features the mazda 6 is having a rust problem m how much can a car cost before its out of this category 30 35 40 the 3series fits the definition of near luxury by almost every review and mag even if one takes every single goody and runs the price up to 45k its still near luxury the 5series by comparison has more upscale features and with good negotiations you can get one for a hair over 40k there are no absolutes and people have their own opinions but to me the cars discussed here are all in class strongly believe the segmentation should be based on what is actually paid not on inflated msrps this is really a sign of what the market thinks is the real value of the car think the heartmeant of this segment is around 2750032500 with the fringes at 2500027500 and 3250035000 a car with an msrp of 4000044000 that actually sells for around 35000 really is in this segment lincoln ls cadillac cts infiniti m45 and some others heavily discount their cars this would cover everything from acura tsx nissan maxima jag xtype 25 mb c230 and 300m at the low end and the 330i 525i jag xtype 30  c320 at the high end with a ton of cars in the middle leaves cars like cts6 ls6 and is300 in the middle jag xtype a great example easy to see msrps of the 30 over 40000 but jag needs heavy subsidies and discounts to move and for 2004 jag lowered the base price of the 30 by a couple thousand dollars and added a couple thousand dollars of free standard equipment the market spoke what this car was worth not to pick nits but didnt you in anotherpost above somewhere suggest cars should be compared msrp to msrp here you are doing an apparent flipflop 35 gs is the top then i would submit to you that the 2004 bmw 330i with sport pk 18 wheel and adaptive xenon headlights in jet black would be the perfect pick looks like dealer cost for euro delivery is 33600 id pay the 35 gs and scrounge up airfare to munich kdshapiro ive always tried to base a purchase decision on what i can buy a particular car for and how much i think it will cost me to own msrp is an important consideration more so for those marques that can charge at or near msrp but the reality of a specific purchase decision has to take into account the actual money that will change hands both now and in the long haul remember the old g35 vs 3 series debate i always mentioned bmw cca discount for members longterm resale value value of free maintenance etc others raised ed price i also included cpo when g35 first came out there was a limited supply and it was hot to market with dealers not moving much off msrp though that has certainly changed now compared to the readilyavailable e46 3 series that came out as my99 just looking at msrps didnt do justice to the cost analysis of course since discounts may vary by region time of year etc msrp always has to be an initial starting point not only do discounts vary by region time of year etc but they vary by buyer comparing what you could get 2 different cars for can be completely different than what i could get 2 different cars for just because your local bmw dealer gives you 10k off car x doesnt mean i could do the same or vice versa so comparing what cars sell for is extremely difficult the only way ive seen to do something like this fairly is to use an online buying service where the prices are available to the public like carsdirect or similar or to strictly use tmv here on edmunds along with this the hit that is taken you sell a vehicle is your personal hit or personal depreciation it does not represent the national average your car may be in a hot or cold market good or bad condition and you may have good or bad negotiating skills has anyone have info regarding how the s60r compares to the g35 sedan the s60r costs more but has much better seats and awd probably comparable performance g has a bit more room in the back seat  re gwhat can a person due to increase hp from 260 to 280 without doing extreme and  innovations questions has anyone driven volvos s60r and how does it compare to the g35\\nok 3rd question if i get a sedan what can i do to create more horsepower without going overboard in expense i want a performance sedan not a kids car the volvo is fast off the line  but imo its a turbo vs na thing which i believe all else equal you take the na people who ahve driven the volvo have said that its very fast but not quite a sports sedan and doesnt feel as planted as a g or 3 to mod the g you can do a ton with the work the guys owning 350z have done  since the underpinnings are the same as the g the g guys do what the z guys innovate cold air intake pulleys light flywheel grounding kit intake plenum upgrade cams are available headers catbacks and true duals are almost availble ecu upgrades to raise redline and improve mods where the ecu retard them by defaukt are available as well ps a guy with exhaust intake and plenum upgrade with a ecu flash got a 141 in an auto sedan i think you could get to 139 with all the above na baby some or many of these may add up to a couple grand but its fun for me over time to do most of these things much more mods i think the m3 was good for and plenty more to come there are some serious enthusiast in g forums out there too check em out ecu chip or reflash exhaust and intake with the r youd probably be up to around 340350 hp with modest mods like that with the g35 its tougher to say but maybe you could get it up to 275285 if a chip is available without getting into the big money mods probably the biggest advantage of the r aside from awd is the 4c suspension i really dont know why anyone would say it doesnt feel as planted when all reviews ive read state that you would not want to use the advanced setting on the r unless you were on a track sounds pretty planted to me but i havent driven both cars so take that for what its worth my a4 18t cvt has been a pleasure going on 7 months and counting the car handles like a dream has more than enough power and has been dead on realiable to date kudos to audi for such a fine automobile hi i am trying to decide between the g35 and a bmw 330i and wud appreciate any ideas on what else i shud try ive tried both cars plus the is300 and the rx8 i was almost sold on the g35 until i read about its brake and cd players problems plus people are not pleased with infinitis service i guess now i have no option bc the only comparable car to a g35 bmw 330i w performance packagea must otherwise its too slow is too much  after receiving excellent service from both honda and saab i have no interest in getting crap from any service deptdealer i mean saab gives you a loaner even if you are getting an oil change and they just finished replacing the entire 200 watt harmon kardon sound system on my 95 because one speaker was fried which was me playing the music too loud not a defect i definitely do not want to downgrade either in car quality my 95 has been perfect or service however i just did some research on lexis and and infiniti is rated very high by jd power and associates for initial quality for the 2003 model year 1 lexus\\n2 cadillac\\n3 infiniti 8 bmw\\n11 honda\\n14 benz\\n29 mazda\\n32 saab for dependability in 2003 this rated vehicles of the 2000 model year after 3 years 1 lexus\\n2 infiniti 13 bmw\\n12 saab\\n26 benz for 1998 models after 4 years 1 lexus\\n2 infiniti 10 bmw\\n16 benz\\n19 saab yet the bottom line seems to be that even tho infiniti sells great cars it has never developed the cachet of lexus much less bmw etc so it is desperate to sell cars it is trying to rebuild its line and nissan out of the slump brought on by the weak yen and the success of lexus of course the problem is that it seems to be caring more about getting customers than keeping customers unless i get this car for below invoice i wont take the chance on crappy product or service am i right i think the s60r is nice inside  has soft leather all around infiniti has more hard plastic imo orange gauges look horrible in g35 while volvo has cool looking blue\\nclutch is stiffer in g35 volvo has a light but spring loaded feel the shifter of the g vibrates and takes a lot to get used to when shifting into reverse far right and downward motion volvo doesnt vibrate and shifts into reverse more normally what im used to\\nboth look good but have totally different looks g 35 has that japanesse looks whiel volvo has a more sedated euro look\\nvolvo steering feels looser at low parking lot speeds but tightens up when speed is increased g35 feels a little tight both stick to the road and both seemed like they stop pretty well i did not feel tubro lag and s60 had pop when accelating s60 is awd and weighs moredont need awd in fla i think the s60 is a little faster and hold a little better big 18 wheels w p zeros\\nso my delema is which one do i get\\nwhat will hold up betterin the long term s60r is awd which i guess is nice but really isnt needed in fla\\none is more expensive but is damm good both in and out one is cheaper looks better out then in\\ni think the g35 sedan wont hold value as well as the s60r because they will be produced in greater quanity\\nany opinions would be appreciated has the best residual of any coupe sold right now including bmw  per kilingers who i think does lease residuals the sedan supposedly is worth 56 after 4 years and the coupe 62 ill live with that volvo with turbo may not be the easiest car to unload 4 years old if you want accurate information on lease residuals the carman in the finance and warranty board will be able to tell you what the residuals are kiplinger provides finance cos with residuals if you want to acquire a car you have to go to the dealers and negotiate a deal bmws have had historically very high residuals while infiniti has had historically low residuals nothing i have seen or heard of has changed this but you have to be willing to go toetotoe witht he dealer to get the best deal is just that history residuals change all the time  get the facts before you decide based on a forum with old information\\nps there is no negotiating the resiudual it is what the bank tells you it is and no car dealer can change it there may be not negotiating the residual but everything else is up for grabs including the cap cost history is useful in that it gives a sense of the future reputation which is the companies number one asset is based on history link lease questions  ask here of cap cost and residuals reflect market sentiment of a used car in the past nothing other than current residuals and money costs matter right now for a new car purchase if history is an indication of future perfmance meaningful info is best found elsewhere such as the jd power results when residuals for 4 years out are best in class right now  why would you look at the past markets change  dont buy stocks this way most people buy blue chip stocks based on past history i dont anyone who throws out a blue chip stock because they had a bad quarter usually look at the bigger picture the same with lease residuals the reason they are high for bmw is historically people are willing to pay a good dollar for bmw used vehicles there is no fluffy big picture to a quantitatively defined lease residual the g coupe gets best in class in kiplingers december personal finance issue bmw get some nice comments as well but right now  the only thing that matters is what the math works out to be on a deal done today by virtue of todays lease residuals it costs less to buy g coupea as opposed to a 330ci  all else equal youre not wrong to say that people have historically paid more for used bimmers e its true now the reality is people will pay the most for a g coupe of any car out there infiniti has had great cars for thier entire existence and now the market has bidded up one car int he lineup to reflect this bmw manages its used car markets better than anyone and perhaps nissan learned something history is nice but inadequate in most cases to accurately determine future trends people who look backwards only in portfolio management get fired in fact the real finds are in places where history has not been so kind history is generally the only accepted principal in the financial markets im not sure why you say it isnt you are correct lease residuals are enforce for a deal done in this specific minute they can change in one day but kiplingers doesnt make the market they report the financial news and again the reason bmw lease residuals are typically high is due to the overall demand of usedcpo vehicles check this link for a comparision between bmwaudiinfinity car_man lease questions  ask here oct 7 2003 719amkeywordsallinmsgtext20limitee9394d20g35 the statemnt i was rebutting  nothing i have seen or heard of has changed this but you have to be willing to go toetotoe witht he dealer to get the best deal \\n \\nread the article the bank buys the residual info from some one who analyzes the market if not kiplinger then who even if they are reporting the facts onlyyou can say youve seen this change re the financial discussion perhaps we should take it elsewhere the only fundamental principal held by chartered financial analysts the highest designation for institutional money managers is having a basis for representing to a client that an invstment is suitable based on his needs this specifically has to based on forward looking fundamentals reversion to the mean priciples suggests that what has done well in the past will not in the future and vice versa\\nhistory is about the last place you can justify an investment to a board a judge or the disciplinary body that can revoke the charter any one in money magagemnt  not a broker  will tell you history only serves to put a company on the radar for your selection process if you want to read up on this type modern porfolio theory into google i didnt get my lease from a bank and its either 62 or 63 as of one month ago the above link suggested infiniti was points behind bmw if it is now changed its changed and it will change tomorrow again but again history suggests that bmws hold a higher residual than infiniti if infiniti is pumping up the residual there will be a glut of used g35s available at bargain basement prices in a few years 66 for a coupe g after 3 years read it one more time  december issue infiniti can not set the residuals  the banks do any time i say bank its interchangable with financial institution did your mom lend you the money most institutions have similar numbers it will change tommorrow but probably not drastically the glut of ubiquitous 3s may drive that down  could be time to get a deal on a cpo 325 chrisboth  the lending instutition sets the residuals if the lending institution is wholly owned by the manufacturer they can set any residual they want will someone come forward and say they leased a g35 coupe with a 66 residual what was the money factor im not buying kiplingers to see what the infiniti residuals are and if they set it too high they lose thier job or business predicting values 35 years out is an art and setting them this high has to be based on great market percpetion and actual values obtained in used car markets you get stuck with 66 of a car you have to be able to make money on it still apparently institutions belive the g is the best coupe out here based on available and recently changed residuals in leasecomparecom the best residual for a g35c is 62 the best residual for a bmw 330i is 56 standard 36 month lease with 0 down buying the car at msrp yields these payments bmw 330i 597mo\\ng35c 496mo 100 difference just wanted to throw some numbers out there personally i lease what i like and dont let residuals make the choice for me my a4 has a much lower residual than both the g35 or the bmw but i enjoy the heck out of it my 2 cents speed interesting comparing apples to apples leasecomparecom gave slightly over a 50 residual on the g35 old information it does not reflect what actually happens currently ie not real time such as the awesome tmv sponsored by this site its a better residual now there is no going back probably extremely accurate check it out btwleasecomparecom uses residuals from leasing companies most folks will lease through the manufacturers financing arm and those residuals tend to be much better than those from leasing companies if nmac wants to to subsidise 66 residuals thats ok i am sure the money factor is adjusted for the higher residual anyway so it balances out speedracer you are right in cases where companies offer higher residuals they would demand high interest or money factors if youd prefer in my experience the manufacturers own financial company usually gives the higher residuals however beware that even though the monthly payments of highreshighmf  lowreslowmf come out the same if you decide to buy the vehicle at leaseend you would have to pay more for the higher residual personally ive found the residual values on carscom to better reflect what i see on usedcar listings you decide to buy the vehicle at leaseend you would have to pay more for the higher residual then one should be buying outright from the beginning leasing for 3 years and then buying is more expensive than buying outright from the beginning as everyone should know nissaninfiniti fortunes have changed completely the last few years including residuals so the past is not much of an indication apparently theres a auto research that predicts five year residuals and obviously g35 is not five year old yet it predicts the g coupe will have the best five year residual in its class which includes 330ci in the nonpremium market nissan residuals are moving closer to the perennial leaders honda  toyota the 04 tl is rated number 1 in a comparison of 15 near luxury automobiles consumer reports is the most respected publication for reviewing automobiles because they accept no advertising furthermore cr rated acura the number one manufacturer in the world for reliability two months ago based on most recent models 19992001 it was ranked number 1 based on performance luxury sportiness value and reliability not knocking acura or cr but jd powers website presents different information on reliability just look it up serious sports sedan enthusiasts recognize inherent limitations of fwd vs rwd yes  so if you want a good value automobile an acura is it actually the best value around is the stripper g35 without leather for 26k for 10k less if you want to drive the best entry level sports sedan in the world its the 3series btw bmw was given the alg awards for having the highest residual value of any manufacturer you can read about it on their website consumer reports is the most respected publication for reviewing automobiles because they accept no advertising furthermore cr rated acura the number one manufacturer in the world for reliability two months ago based on most recent models 19992001 cr is known for mom and pop minvan level reviews of cars they have no business even driving most enthusiast would probably ignore cr and look to the true auto mags for opinion before buying cr is great for people who know nothing other than what people tell them and want a camry wellll that is your opinion of course others are free to hold their own opinions as im sure you will agree any auto reviewer that can state 530i is the best sport sedans ever tested regardless price must know something about automobiles yep hear ya but that vehicle probably doesnt fit into the discussion subject here and cr isnt the subject either so lets get back to talking about near luxury performance sedans and happy new year  i looked at buying a bmw 330i when i was looking at the 04tl i bought the new tl  auto with nav  because the equivelant features on the bmw were 10k more everything was extra i am sure the 330i is a killer ride and will outperform the tl in the twisty parts of the road  but by how much then again even after paying many extra  for the performance packagethe 330i is still down 35hp to the tl i used to road race motorcycles and if i only had a buck for every time i passed people in a corner only to watch them go flying past on the straight because they had more hp how many of you actually drive your cars hard enough in a corner to get the extra benefit of the rwd on the 330i  many of you do however drive fast on the freeway in a relatively straight line or drive in the snow ill take the 10gs and the 35hp and the stereo and the nav and on and on and on  but by how much  that is exactly the question when you plunk down 35k for a tl when you can get a perfectly acceptable hyundia for 12k you start to ask yourself is the extra 23k worth it is the tl over 3000 better of course it isnt you just like to make yourself feel better when you think your paying less for something that you believe to be equivalent and you are really making out because there is something that cant be used that cost money in the other item but people cant take advantage of it that is the whole value equation in life for me either ill get the hyundia and pocket the 23k difference or ill spring for the extra 10k righthow could anybody possibly take an unbiased 68 year old publication whos auto test department includes a 327acre stateoftheart test track and autotesting facility that seriously get real chrisboth your summation of cr is without any factual basis all you have managed to do is compromise your own credibility how in the world can you compare the price difference between a 12k hyundia and a 35k tl it makes no sense there is no logic to your statement the cars are in two different leagues by your logic why would you even buy the 3 series it is just an entry luxury sedan why not spring for an extra 20000 and get a 5 series sedan or another 35000 and get a 7 series or an audi a8 and if you dont want to spring for the extra cash then why did you buy the 3 series in the first place just buy the hyndia you keep talking about calm down bmwdoug youre missing the whole point man noboby can make outlandish comparisons and generalizations like kd can hes taken playing the devils advocate a whole other level just sit back relax and watch a real master at work dude youll learn something ok sorry for the interuption kd the floor is your again please tell us the story one more time about how the tl is a communist plot to overthrow this country and the lexus es is our performance sedan savior dont get into a debate with kd on value because to him if youre not spending the money to drive a bmw you might as well save as much as possible and buy a hyundai i dont think theres any right answer on value bmw has prestige and road handling that is in a class by itself and if you must have those 2 things then spending the extra money for the bmw is worth it if prestige does not matter to you and youre happy with a car which handles 90 as well as a bmw then clearly its not worth it to get the bmw everyones value system and economic means are different and results in different valuations of cars if im making 50 million a year i dont care about a 10k difference in car prices between a bmw and something else its less than 1 of my net worth and ill get what i want if im making 50k a year that extra 10k represents a much greater portion of my income 20 of my net worth and i would not part with it unless i felt the car was 20 better frankly im sick and tired of the fwd vs rwd debate i have driven a ton of both fwd and rwd cars and just bc a car is rwd doesnt mean it automatically drives better than a fwd car mercedes for example makes a pretty fine car and its rwd but most benzes i have ever driven have not been the greatest handling cars please note that i have not driven every model benz just going by personal exp so no need to flame me for above statement for example i had to drive my cousins ml320 this weekend to get more food for my new years party his car was the last one in the driveway so was the only one available well the seats and the sound system in the ml320 were great the stiff steering the sway in turns and lack of feel on the road were awful i hit double curves at 70 mph in that ml320 to test it out and came out thinking hmmm this was a bad idea the ml320 is a nice luxury car and has a much nicer interior than my acura mdx but in terms of handling my fwd mdx kicks the rwd ml320 please tell us the story one more time about how the tl is a communist plot to overthrow this country and the es is our performance sedan savior im not advocating any one car because i think they are both excellent cars for the individual who wants to purchase them i do like to play devils advocate when someone says why pay top dollar for car x when car y offers almost the same for less and anyway youll never use all of car xs ability thats all well and good but you have to add the four little letters imho who is anybody to suggest to me how i should spend my money and whether a particular car is worth it to me and whether i will or wont derive any added benefit for paying more this train of thought can be applied against any two vehicles that being said sometimes people will compare vehicles that are not really in the same target market and look at each vehicle on their own merits and then make a choice sometimes it doesnt matter if you get a two or seven seater and you can compare the two seater with the seven seater and each can be good in their own right and a point in time either can satisify your requirements saugatak  this is not a bmw thread and comparing these two vehicles has nothing to do with bmw i am very familiar with both cars and each of these are fine vehicles in their own right they offer different qualities that make them very attractive to potential purchasers there is not one worldly overridding value equation that would make anyone jump at one car or another if there were a manufacturer wouldnt be able to give their vehicles away noboby can make outlandish comparisons and generalizations like kd can hes taken playing the devils advocate a whole other level just sit back relax and watch a real master at work dude youll learn something most people call it being argumentative and find it annoying saugatak  i am going to respectfully suggest you are missing the point of this whole thing and in the course of not understanding the point you call people argumentative it is not about which car is better because every car has its compromises and after all it is not you that is financing my car its me it is about what is the best car for me the es and tl as every other vehicle each have its plus and minus and im going to make a decision based on what i believe is the right choice for me doesnt matter what cr jd power edmunds you or anybody else says most people call it being argumentative and find it annoying yeahbut only if you take him seriously why would any thinking individual do that as far as the rwd vs fwd debate to some people it makes a big difference for whatever the reason is to a particular person a bmw 3 series like the tl like the es is not a one size fits all it depends on what one considers a priority in the vehicle they are purchasing there is no one rightly engineered vehicle shenkar lol kdshapiro kd you are the only person missing the point so let me spell it out for you you continually go around demanding that everyone respect your choice of car but you show absolutely no respect for any other persons choice of carunless of course that person chooses a bmw you continuously make fun of the tl you say that you prefer the looks of a lexus es330 over a tl but you also like the looks of the prebangle and postbangle bmws but dont like the look of pontiac grand ams real headscratcher you keep saying if youre not getting a bmw buy a hyundai you say the criticism of consumer review is worthless because it ranked the tl over the bmw i didnt notice any such criticism when the bmw was ranked above the tl i mean this list is endless the only consistent theme in your wildly inconsistent statements is buy bmw do you own shares you keep talking about your objectivity but i dont see it you say every car has tradeoffs and when i ask you what tradeoff the x5 has your response is it doesnt seat seven lol that is scathing criticism some people have sold their soul to the devil kdshapiro has sold his soul to bmw there really isnt any comparison between fwd and rwd they may both generate similar track numbers though even that is unlikely but they will do it in an entirely different way when you put 60 or thereabouts of weight up front and have the drive wheels do the steering you will get a different driving experience as for value the is300 manual is the sleeper you get near 330i performance luxury and equipment for 325i price not to mention reliability warranty customer service etc you say the criticism of consumer review is worthless because it ranked the tl over the bmw  i dont know what cr said since the only issue i have is the 2004 auto guide in that issue cr said something like the accord is almost as good as the 2004 tl for 5k less and ill say it again unabashedlyif you want the best driving dynamics the 3series is the benchmark the 3series isnt for everyone just like the tl isnt for everyone but it is the benchmark in the entry level luxo sports sedan market you have to choose the vehicle that you feel comfortable with everything else you said in your post is garbage riez i didnt know that the is300 had a stick i will have to take a close look at it thanks for the tip when i was car shopping in the early 90s i had just been blessed with my first child and was accordingly shopping for my first family car cr had a shootout involving the honda accord and the toyota camry the accord according to them had better road feel better acceleration better brakes better handling etc they labelled it the drivers car of the comparison the camry on the other hand was quieter had better trunk access was slightly larger if i remember correctly etc the camry won the comparison based on stuff that was mostly unimportant to me but was definitely important to others fwiw i ended up with an altima but that was based on a financial decision above all else for as reliable as it was i never really liked that car anyway i think cr is an excellent source of mostly objective info the buyer has to decide what is most important for their driving style and lifestyle take the appropriate cars out for a testdrive and then choose accordingly thats one of the best guarded secrets in the industry  lexus did themselves a huge disservice by releasing a good sport sedan in auto only for quite a while infinity did it with the g35 but they followed pretty quickly with the manual tranny and were pretty good about letting people know it was coming soon i do like to play devils advocate when someone says why pay top dollar for car x when car y offers almost the same for less and anyway youll never use all of car xs ability thats all well and good but you have to add the four little letters imho okay so you want other people to write imho but how come you dont preface your posts with the four little letters okay so you want other people to write imho but how come you dont preface your posts with the four little letters i do like to play devils advocate when someone says why pay top dollar for car x when car y offers almost the same for less and anyway youll never use all of car xs ability thats all well and good but you have to add the four little letters imho jrock  at times you appear to be articulate so here is a further explanation the above quote from the original poster is an opinion but its also appears to be a thinly veiled opinion disguised as jealously to reach that conclusion i draw on my own experience i said similiar things to a friend of mine who wanted to purchase a 911 i asked him how he could justify the purchase of a 911 because the roads are crowded and youll never be able to use all of the abilities of the car anyway and you are never going to track it why dont you get an m5 its about half the price he said to me because i want it and i can now that was me being jealous i think we all do this stuff now jrock  let me add imho but we could beat this till the cows come home cr does provide objective factual information i have been a reader since i was 16 and i do trust more than any other magazine their factually gathered information on autos however my reliability experience with cars has not jived in the past with theirs in addition as kominsky stated above my priorities have not meshed with their priorities when they pick a top rated sedan they do so for general populace sometimes its just not the car im looking for due to other reasons and i pick a car thats not quite toprated by them but offers me what i need imho the bmw 3 series is the best handling car in the bunch hands down moreover you get the prestige of a premium nameplate if you dont mind giving up heated leather seats sunroof cd changer nav and other niceties that are included in a comparably priced tl also if you are single or have a family with small kids only rear seat space and trunk size the bmw is ideal because its relatively smaller size enhances nimbleness if you are concerned about snow rwd get the new awd beemer which costs a couple of grand more having said all of the above i would rather get the g35 which gives up little if any in performance and handling when compared with the beemer and use the  savings in filling up the gas tank that gives me miles of driving pleasure plus the reliability of infiniti to boot  saugatak the is300 manual has been on the market since my2002 the is300 came out in my2001 but only with an automatic the sportcross touring also came out in my2002 keep in mind that the is300 does have a 5speed manual 5th is a slight overdrive you can only get the 5speed manual in the sedan the sportcross version comes only with the 5speed automatic you can get lsd with both transmissions but you can only get vehicle stability control vsc with the automatic can be a bit hard to find a 5speed manual many lexus dealers arent keen on them since the overwhelming vast majority of lexi ever sold had automatics check with some dealers love my 04 is300 5speed manual absolute blast to drive fun efficient car i do like to play devils advocate when someone says why pay top dollar for car x when car y offers almost the same for less and anyway youll never use all of car xs ability thats all well and good but you have to add the four little letters imho my post was the one that started this discussion and it is interesting that most of the subsequent discussions werent discussions about the cars but were mostly personal discussions about the people posting\\ni dont think i neeed to put imho on anything i write since it should be apparent that it is my opinion because i am writing it \\nmy point was more along the lines of value for performance and near luxury i think the tl is the winner on those merits because i get more for my money with the tl paying an extra 10k for the prestige of the bmw name is ok if what you want is prestige i am sure the guy in the 330i i blew off at the stoplight the other day is telling himself he has more prestige\\ni am not sure every 330i owner is going to lose me on twisty road sections but i do know what 35hp in a straight line means it means he better lose me in the twisty sections because he will give it back when the road straightens out\\nfor the 10k i didnt spend on the bmw 330i do you suppose i could make even more performance improvements or make many near luxury improvements to my tl oh thats right the tl already comes with more than the bmw \\ni saw a 2004 535i yesterdaynot a pretty car some people dont focus on the value side of the equation i do and i dont and it depends on what im getting sometimes i want the best i felt the 5k more for the driving experience of a bmw is worth every penny i spend a lot of time in my car and this is the most fun ive ever had keep your supposed goodies the 3 series goes to 60 in 56 seconds and has a top speed of 153 does the quarter mile at about 98 and 14recent car and driver im sure the guy you blew off at the light was laughing at you thinking this guy has a new car and has to show it off its just not worth it stop light races never impress me lets go to the track if you believe people buy bmw for prestige than all people have to buy the upscale brands for prestige as well after all why would one buy a bmw for prestige but not an acura the upscale division of honda for prestige if one wants to argue about the amount of prestige a car has go ahead i sincerely believe people buy a car because of the reputation of the manufacturer one list thing about value i dont need to be told a tl has more value than a 330 a honda accord has more value than a tl a mazda 6 fourbanger has more value than an accord an elantra has more value than a mazda 6 fourbanger its a given the less you spend on a car the more value it has because it is fulfilling a basic need of getting you from point a to point b what somebody on this forum would want to know is what is the rational for purchasing one vehicle over another prestige poseurs kinds of people who buy automobiles etc dont answer that question they are only selfserving reasons i saw a 2004 535i yesterdaynot a pretty car its a heck of a lot more handsome than the acura tl but thats imho you are both right the new e60 5 series and the new tl are ugly on the outside just like the new maxima stylists styling purely for trendy styling sake see it isnt that hard to agree is it leave it to riez to find common ground if prestige does not matter to you and youre happy with a car which handles 90 as well as a bmw then clearly its not worth it to get the bmw the last tome i looked at comparison stats the 330i handled about 9095 as well as the gprestige notwithstanding as far as cr being reliable in terms of performance oriented reviews i agree with kdshapiro in that they targtet the mass buyer and will point out some very intersting negatives occasionally there are many imo that will agree that they are a little more camry and minivan comparison worthy than 350z and zhp worthy 50000 acre test facililty wont get them better drivers or more enthused drivers all the arguments about the pricevalue equation have the same old value is in the eye of the beholder ending the thing people forget with the g is that prestige is not paid for in the diplacement department and if a hypothetical buyer wants to get into the low 14 game with world class brakes and handling he can get it for 28k want a comparable 330i and how much is it 10k more at least the whole value thing gets blown out of proportion and people need to relilze that bmw is excxlusive in that they will beat you to death with any options and everything is optional that addl 5 litres is a big nut and takes a very reasonable platform that can be had for a pretty good priced and makes it the same price as a 5 series someone above said you could spend 20k more than a 3 and just get the 5 series  no  you can spend less and get a 5 series in some cases the 3 is pricey cuz people will pay it its called good marketing and great productname perceptions its called good marketing and great productname perceptions yes and id like to add its also called execution and delivery bmw products deliver they are not an empty shill chris its always about value it never stops being about value but everybodys definition is different that is why some people will buy a 70k rolex and some people a 10 timex who am i to tell the 70k rolex buyer it does not represent good value to them they after all both tell time i cant you can only buy what you believe fits you and your lifestyle you will buy as much as finances allow not less thats why you ridicule a hyundia think of how the less fortunate must feel when they get their first new hyundia thank you i cant spel without my glases i understand i cant hear without mine i think it would be a fair fight at a red light or the racetrack bmw 330i\\ntransmission 6speed manual\\nzero to 60 mph 56 sec\\nzero to 100 mph 153 sec\\nstanding 14mile 143

or are you referring to the 5at tl which does not second i dont understand why bmw just does not up the horsepower in its inline 6s those engines have been around for a while with all the work bmw has done on its vanos v8s surely they can migrate some of the technology down and free up some additional horsepower ive heard that honda has the ability to get 350 hp out of its basic sohc vtec v6 engine if true that is amazing engineering and good news for acura fans because well always be ahead of everyone else when it comes to the hp game of course honda had better make a rwd platform soon so we can take advantage of that power no matter what bmw fans say about well i could beat u on the track or i dont have torque steer or if the roads were winding youd eat my dust fact is raw horsepower is incredibly useful and most racing occurs not in tracks or windy roads but on freeways or from stop light to stop light every time im merging into the right line of a busy highway with a short exit ramp and i see that 6ton trailer coming in my rear view mirror im glad for all the horses i have and am happy for more i find that these discussions always start off comparing value driving dynamics prestige etc but at some point the ultimate argument gets unleashed keep telling yourself how much better your car is while you eat my dust and look at my cars disappearing nonpermissible content removed its great that tl drivers can make the ultimate argument keep telling yourself how much better your car is while you eat my dust and look at my cars disappearing nonpermissible content removed well if you think you can go ahead imho you havent had a humble opinion yet i started this string with a legitimate question of performance and value actually raher you have been nasty i spent a lot of time at the track when i was younger im not saying bmw is the be all and end all but performance and value are completely opposite if you think the tl will track better than the 3 series more power to you btw racing nonstreet legal cars is a whole different ball game than taking your street legal almost unmodified car to the track hey raher my bimmer has been to the shopoh lets see may 2003 last before that august 2002 i think once a year to the shop for an oil change is sufficient total out of pocket costs to date 0 i think it qualifies as reliable btw what point are you trying to make in your post speaking of what point are you trying to makei am not following your observation that taking non street legal cars to the track is a whole different ball game than taking your street legal almost unmodified car to the track what was your first clue  what is your point \\ni am fairly certain that the statistics on repairs etc for bmws probably include a few more cars than just yours i am on my third acura and have never had a problem acura is rated as the number one most reliable automobile between 19992003 by your favorite uninformed magazine consumer reports\\nmy point in the original post  remember i started this discussion  and my continuing point on this subject is that for 35k i believe the 04 acura tl is the best value out there in a 4 door automobile what you get for a given amount of money is one way to measure value you get more for 35k in the tl than any of its competitors\\nbtw hey raher  nice touch ok raherwell leave it at that we have two different thought processes going here and all is good there is room on this planet for both opinions both thoughts and both cars its shapiro spewing his bmw elitist rhetoric funny how some things dont change one other important thing missing from those stats is price i dont have that info from the mag handy but that 330i apparently had the performance pack add in all the options already included in the tl and it looks to me to stack up something like this\\ntl  33k\\n330i  47k maybe someone can correct me if im wrong you absolutily right comparable equipped 330 does cost more that10k over tl and one more thing 330 for 35k does not have better performance in any way like kd i am going to make huyndai example her 330 without performance package is like huyndai in every way in and out correct but you still get a car that will outhandle the tl on a track or a street according to our worthless source cr the standard 330i will outhandle the standard g35 i am sure the standard g35 will outhandle the standard tl therefore the standard 330i will outhandle the standard tl i dont begrudge the tl anything you can have your goodies but ill take the driving experience for those who think the 330 with performance package costs 47 blueguydotcom got his for about 39k you might want to search the 3series board for more information no it wasnt a stripper but all of this is academic until both these cars are taken to the track ahhh speedracer good to see you back spewing your garbage as well the vast majority of bmw owners do not drive manuals nor do they speedbecause you cannot speed in the us anyway just like most suv owners do not go off road it is all about status acura tl\\n600 mph 115 feet braking performance is topnotch too with 60to0 stops averaging a short neat 115 feet our drivers were very impressed with our 6speeds alldisc abs brakes with brembo front calipers results are comparable to some recent porsches weve tested  motorweek thats right shapiroporsches at this years 2004 los angeles auto show acura unveiled its tl aspec concept this car sits on a two inch wider track with 21 inch wheels and is powered by a modified 32liter v6 that puts out a total of 300 hp if this car makes it to production and it probably will it will leave the 330i in the dust and give the 5series a run for its money i saw the arguments about the tl and the 330 it is all about the buyers choice i love my 03 m3 and i also love my 03 g35 they are imho exceptional cars for the price i paid i believe m3 handling can not be easily matched with a car in the same price range except the corvette g35 is also an excellent car and handles almost as good as the 330 i got the g because i didnt want another bmw 3 series the car is exceptional when it comes to performance and the looks many people talk to me about the car in parking lots and gas stations meanwhile an m3 is as we know m3\\ni recently test drove the tl actually borrowed it from the dealer  manager is my friend and there was so much hype about the car so i got it for a couple of hours their demo drove around the town and i was quite impressed it is a way better car than the old tl but the hype in my opinion is not well worth\\nthe sound system works excellent if you actually have a dvd audio disc they had one that was sent from the factory i think and it is just excellent quality but when you put a regular cd it is nothing ordinary\\nthe performance it has excellent pick up but the fwd downgrades the potential of this car whatever others say there is the torque steer this car would have been excellent as an rwd and i think as far as the pick up in street start the g will beat the tl well we know m3 performance is something else\\nthe interior is good quality but does not match the refinement of the bmw 3 series or the audi or the mb but better than the g the interior space was less than the g along with the trunk space i guess the g is a larger car overall and that makes a lot of difference especially for me with a family and lots of people in the car at all times i think interior space is similar to 3 series sedan i am 63 and with my seating position there was almost no space at the back of the drivers seat a similarity to the 3 sedan\\nthe handling of the car is not as refined as the 3 or the g i realized this when i was entering a highway ramp at about 6065 mph and felt the need to hold the steering wheel with both hands very steady because the car almost got out of the road it was a scary moment and such wouldnt happen with a rwd 3 series or the g or the quattro audi the handling is of course no issue in straight roads but not everybody drives crazy like me in the backroads\\ni would prefer an audi quattro 3 series or the g for backroads mountain roads but definitely not a tl the car just didnt make me feel comfortable enough kind of made me scared in a couple of situations\\nthe looks are not so much in my style it feels so dull and very accord like it doesnt have a unique feeling of itself i think they should have worked on the looks a little bit longer\\noverall the tl is an excellent value for an ordinary daily driver it offers so much for so less good interior good performance good safety features and a low msrp\\nbut for those who dont mind spending the extra cash i know that many will opt for other vehicles acura tl in my opinion is the choice for first time nearluxo car buyers who do not have the ability of spending another 5k without worrying about their pockets i am looking forward to the new vette and most likely i will be the first in line to add the car into my garage and then maybe trade in the g for the 05 audi a6 quattro meanwhile the argument of bmw is better than tl better than mb better than g better than this that can go on forever but one need to know that everybody has a different budget and different reason for buying a car some people may not mind spending 40k some people may only afford 34k some can not even afford that and some go out and buy a ferrari for 200k instead of comparing i think it is best to drive the car and enjoy the purchase i honestly did not see a ferrari owner and a lamborghini owner fighting and arguing about their cars and try to prove one is better than the other because they just dont care much they enjoy th at this years 2004 los angeles auto show acura unveiled its tl aspec concept this car sits on a two inch wider track with 21 inch wheels and is powered by a modified 32liter v6 that puts out a total of 300 hp\\nif this car makes it to production and it probably will it will leave the 330i in the dust and give the 5series a run for its money car alerady has 270  another 30 hp does not thrust this car into supercar status especially since its torque output will prob be about where it is now dont forget bmw has a perf pack for the 3 as wellbe sure to compare apples and will those big wheels help the torque steer that the existing car seems to struggle withit might not be pretty taking a fwd format that is pressed to perform even in the acccord and add hp braking  sorry the 70 to 0 braking of 189 reported in c  d was not the best numbers i guess if you keep the tl at sixty even your golden engines  bmw has a 3l na engine that puts out 400 horsepower but unfortunately well never see it a new 2004 accord drove up into my driveway last night it had all the goodies satnav etc out the door price was a little over 28k the tl with nav is about 35k after tooling around in this vehicle i realized the only reason that people would go for the tl at 7k more or the tsx which is a fourbanger is the socalled prestige factor of the acura brand you could never derive the additional 7k in driving benefit from a tl and it beats the tsx hands down for the pricefeature content this car beats em all of course it is fwd and if you are happy with that you will probably be getting a reliable honda with a powerful engine and a smooth drive train after thinking about it i can see why there might be some people who dont want to spring for the extra money for a 330i to get it identically optioned its because the perception is they are actually getting less for their money i can now see that as i believe when you buy a tl with nav etc your money has hit the point of diminishing returns against a similiarly equipped accord you are actually paying more money to get less car while i really wanted an x3 due to the ne climate i might have to reverse myself and say the honda with nav and such offers the best bang for the buck even though it has torque steer and fwd and save myself 12 grand which i can use towards my kids college education or home improvements for those who love numbers compare performance and price numbers for cars like the neon srt4 and sentra ser spec v ensure you add the available performance options like lsd to srt4 and the brembo brake package to the spec v then compare these cars which cost around 20000 to the 330i or tl that srt4 will run run over the tl or 330i and save you a small fortune in the process but is it a legitimate comparison price to performance is not the only way to go nor even always a relevant comparison kd people buy tl over accord for the same reason you bought your 330 over 325 riez those two cars you mentioned have no luxury factor if i would settle for something like that i would get wrx sti or evolution 8 zumbalak looks like you have a lot of experience driving rwd that is why you had few scary moments driving fwd tl you dont drive fwd the way you drive rwd i for example had a few scary moments driving g35 coup 6mt bacouse im not use to pushing rwd to the limit i even span once pg48477 you prove my point if luxury is the primary criteria then why are people obsessing about performance numbers and if pricevalue is the primary criteria then there are a lot better less expensive cars out there and that leaves us the dilemma of this board what does it mean to be a near luxury performance sedan are luxury and performance equal or is performance more important than luxury or vice versa i firmly believe in performance taking precedence but not at the expense of luxury and other factors like reliability warranty customer service operating costs etc cannot be left out of the equation but if you dont define terms and weight what is important all you do is debate apples and oranges or granny smith apples vs red delicious apples there have been some recent posts suggesting the tl is overall best value by whose yardstick are we measuring and what is the factual criteria 1 number of goodies\\n2 size of backseat\\n3 driving experience\\n4 hp and torque\\n5 oveall performance numbers\\n6 cost and financing\\n7 drivetrain what are the soft criteria 1 looks of vehicle\\n2 estimated resale value in x years\\n3 qualityluxury of interior\\n4 manufacturer reputation\\n5 dealer reputation\\n6 supposed value of automobile note hard value goes up as total cost decreases but soft value is based on the compromises one finds in the automobile for example a hyundai has a lot of hard value but to some people not a lot of soft value is hard value or soft value more important one size doesnt fit all for me performance is important but money is also important for example i would not pay 10k more for 330 over tl for only marginally better handling but worse power train on the other hand i would pay 20 more for m3 which has way better handling and way better powertrain you finally answered your huyndai question\\nboth are important and tl would be had to had with 330 if you compare everything you just said assuming that tl and 330 cost the same  we probably would have a tie but being that tl cost 10k less we now know who the winner is think thats a topic for another board but i dont think anyone can argue that v6 camry or v6 accord will refer to them as camcord from now on give you best bang for buck yes you can get a lower brand car but the camcord is renowned for its reliability and low gas mileage and due to its reliability has a low total cost of ownership tco with respect to the price differential between a navaccord and a navtl i agree the navaccord wins in the value equation but from what ive read somebody with more exp with both systems please help me out the acuras nav system is a lot better i have not bought any nav systems in my cars to this point i find a 20 mapatlas that i can carry from car to car is a pretty unbeatable value so i dont know this for sure but my understanding is that the nav system on the tl allows you to say phone home and then the car will dial the number for you whereas this is not possible on the navequipped accord now this may seem silly to you but i kind of dig this feature a lot for 3 reasons 1 i never use a cell phone when driving unless im stuck in traffic and need to tell someone ill be late because its dangerous so to be able to make voiceactivated calls is incredibly useful time is money and if i can conduct some business while on the phone and save some time the nav system on the tl could pay for itself also if you must talk on the phone this is a much safer way to do it and could save your life which is definitely worth something 2 one of my favorite shows as a kid was knight rider in spite of david hasselhoff because the talking corvette with the roving cylon eye was just so cool there is a fun factor in talking to your car and getting a response back that is hard to quantify 3 if i buy the tl itll be the 6mt so with a stick in right hand and wheel in left hand voiceactivated calling is really more than a luxury its almost a necessity the point is although objectively the navaccord beats the navtl i think there are some good reasons to spring the extra  for the superior acura navvoice system with respect to the current generation v6 accords i found that honda took all the driving fun out of the current gen accord to me they have the driving feel of a camry and frankly the camry is a better camry than the accord is when you compare prices on the nonnav accord v6 and nonnav tl i think the price difference is only 3700 based on my market research that i could get the accord for 600 over invoice and the tl for 2k under msrp based on whats been posted on the prices paid boards i think the extra 3700 is money well spent to upgrade from nonnav accord to nonnav tl also i really want a 6mt and unfortunately the accord sedan does not come in 6mt and v6 id have to get the accord 6mt v6 coupe and my wifes response when i suggested that we save some cash on my car by me getting the accord 6mt coupe was i always sit in the front and you are responsible for putting son in the back seat and pulling him out of the back seat well i like to save money like the next guy but destroying my back is not the way im gonna do it so its the tl for me i dont normally defend kdshapiro but i really think that his basic point that value is in the eyes of the beholder is correct its kind of hard to compare the tl to any bmw bc pricewise its closer to the 3series but sizewise its comparable to the 5series if you are someone who places a high premium on being able to hit 270 degree exit ramps at 65 and really enjoys driving your car beyond 810ths on twisty roads there really is just one sedan out there for you and thats bmw also as someone who drove a 3series in his 20s i have to say that i had a much much easier time picking up hot girls with that car than any other car ive had before or since i think if you exclude the 2 factors i mentioned above the tl whomps the bmw 3series but getting hot girls with minimal efforts is as they say in the mastercard commercial priceless ok i think most of the people on these boards are men and hopefully i havent offended any women tl is right in between 5 and 3 in size plus its being considered near luxury performance sedan everybody have their own opinion on any subject but consideration by majority puts thing in perspective i also place a high premium on being able to get of the corner by accelerating hard and i believe fwd is better in this department your post is interesting in that you are arguing with yourself at times as to what is a better value  the accord or tl as many of us have noted although value is relative it may also be measured objectively however even this objectively quantifiable factor may be viewed subjectively depending on the viewers wealth dispositions and priorities in life spending habits  and not to mention the proverbial ego or status factor as to the last factor people seem quite touchy  defensively and offensively  ok i think most of the people on these boards are men and hopefully i havent offended any women i would be more careful if i were you because i am not sure whether our revered host pat is patrick or patricia  the knight rider car was a pontiac firebird not a corvette perhaps the shows producers felt that the firebird offered better value pg48477 you write for example i would not pay 10k more for 330 over tl for only marginally better handling but worse power train but you can say the exact same thing only even worse for the accord v6 vs tl they are siblings from the same company thus if you cant say it for the accord you cant logically say it for the 330i we always end up apples to oranges because we cant agree on even the most basic of things for example what is the relevant price spread is it under 40k over 25k but less than 45k for me i think the meat of this market segment is in the 2750032500 range but this segment includes outliers costing at least 25k but no more than 35k but notice how subjective everything is thus for me the 330i comparison should be with a stripped one not a loaded one the loaded ones and the 330i with perf pkg push 40k to me 40k is squarely in the realm of luxury performance sedan there aint no near at 40k that is why i went with a loaded is300 manual for approx 32500 msrp when a similar 330i was nearly 40k for 32500 msrp i could get a decently equipped but just 325i but not a 330i and i dont want to bring in ed issue wish we had three boards one for fwd one for awd and one for rwd for me there is no such thing as a performance fwder that is an oxymoron and i wouldnt want the weight penalty that awd brings and staying purely subjective there is no such thing as a performance car with an automatic transmission so these discussions would only be covering cars not controlled dominated by slushboxes performance automatic is also an oxymoron the is300 is simply no match for any model tl automatic or manual in all categories and staying purely subjective there is no such thing as a performance car with an automatic transmission so these discussions would only be covering cars not controlled dominated by slushboxes performance automatic is also an oxymoron uhriez theres a mr enzo ferrari on the line to speak with you saugatak the cellphone interface you described handsfreelink is a standard feature on all 2004 tlsnot just cars with nav sys first is is not really a performance car rwd dos not make akar performance\\nsecond we all know that bmw makes one of the best handling cars in the world and it have nothing to do with its being rwd if you know mini couper is also made by bmw and it handle better than 3 series and its fwd second we all know that bmw makes one of the best handling cars in the world and it have nothing to do with its being rwd if you know mini couper is also made by bmw and it handle better than 3 series and its fwd as the saying goes on american idol  i beg to diffa your statement is incorrect to the extent it is not the size or weight of a 3 series yes you can make a gocart perform better than a three series but make the minicooper 3300 lbs give it four real seats and it wouldnt outhandle a gocart with 0 to 60 acceleration of 8 seconds im not sure how it outperforms the 330i but in its weight class it just does fine the srt4 also outperformns the 330i but add an additional 400lbs or so and it wouldnt accelerate its way out of a paperbag add 500lbs and 2 more seats to an s2000 to make its weight equivalent to a 3 series and it wouldnt perform either yes its very easy to make a car that out accelerates any other car just cut down on seats and mitigate with weight and youve got a winner but we are not talking about these types of cars to some paying the additional  for a 330i a vehicle with the best drivetrain in the business smoothest inline six vaunted handling is worth it to others its not whats so hard about that shenkar over the past 50 years what percentage of ferrari have had automatic transmissions just check out the resale value of ferrari comparing automatics to manual kahunah i beg to differ my 04 is300 manual brings way more many smiles to my face than any fwd tl ever can and certainly more than any 03 or earlier tl type s automatic there is nothing less fun than torque steer and having 60 of weight over the drive wheels isnt my cup of driving tea but guessin we are talking apples to oranges im talkin pure driving pleasure on real world roads i drive not tracks we dont drive on or track test results huge difference will be interesting to see how reliable the new tl will be the is has a proven track record over the past 50 years what percentage of ferrari have had automatic transmissions just check out the resale value of ferrari comparing automatics to manual riez im just saying you might want to rephrase that last statement in post 332 cause its falseand i just proved it the past 50 years and comparing values are separate and unrelated issues im only talking about the manual vs automatic argument you made in that post doesnt hold water as is riez  is somewhat correct but where i live i would never own a manual as a daily driver so if by definition i dont have a sporty car so be it i would however own a ssgsmg or the like i just dont want to have to put my foot on the clutch ok i am glad you understand that rwd is not everything in performance 060 acceleration have nothing to do with handling that what i was talking about handling not overall performance but if you want to go this way tl is fester than 330 060 so whats your point is is not 5050 balanced either so i dont know why you so proud of it plus 5mt is not enof for 225 engine you need at least 6mt to even be close is have nothing on tl nothing as in your is300 is no match for my 270 hp brembo equipped 6mt tlon any road but i didnt have to say it as others agree also riez  is somewhat incorrect kd and so are you if you believe his assertion i ask you both to consider among others ferrari stradale modena spyder gta maranello and enzo models which all have automatic transmission options would anybody in their right mind presume to say these are not performance cars because they dont have 4 5 6 or 7 speed manuals as riez is asserting or what about the porsche turbo bmw 760i and the m3 maserati cambio audi rs6 mercedes e55 c32 s55 s600 and a slew more than i can think of at this moment he kinda jumped off the bridge without a parachute on that one and you playing the devils advocate again followed him over in the same way as your analysis of mini cooper vs 330i the 330i would also lose its edge if it had to gain the extra width and wheel base to match g35 and tl as the 530i indeed does in the handling and accelearation departments to both bmw has been playing this rigged game of fielding a smaller sausage to win the handlinghappy rag writers for a long time brightness  you are somewhat incorrect as these cars are in the same class the minicooper by definition or the s2000 is not considered the same class of car we have been through this conversation previously it is what it is our somewhat worthless cr considers the 530i to be the best car it has ever owned period i guess thats rigged also pp  the 330 goes to 60 in 56 seconds it is what it is it also goes to 60 in 75 seconds yes there is a range of performance a range of models and a range of price it is what it is if you feel better in saying the tl is faster to 60 im not gonna disagree as with price and performance this is subjective which i have repeatedly stressed for me there is no such thing as a performance automatic and the performance and funtodrive factor of even a ferrari automatic pails in comparison to the same experience with a manual and keep in mind that smgtype systems used by ferrari maserati bmw aston martin etc are not automatics they are manual transmissions with software and systems to allow an automatic mode but still dont have a torque converter and yes cars as expensive as the new mb mclaren are still not true performance cars what is up with a hyper expensive supercar with a 5speed mb automatic transmission even autoweek ran a poll on this issue shenkar i stand by my subjective opinion a ferrari with an automatic transmission is a travesty one reflected in the future resale market it is less than what a ferrari could and should be kahunah and your 270 hp tl fwder will also out torque steer my car too much weight over front wheels which are also drive wheels fwders can never escape the laws of physics pg48477 the is300 sedan is about 5446 the sportcross wagon is about 5347 not 5050 but certainly not 6040 lexus shouldve moved the battery to the trunk anyone who thinks a tl is just an expensive accord has apparently not driven both or they have and just have so little perception of what they are driving i have they are not the same in any way even the shifter and clutch in the accord v6 coupe has an entirely different feel than in the tl i guess it depends on your definition of performance ill agree that on the racetrack or on the twistybits the manual equipped car will generally ruleall else being equal but on the drag strip or in stoplight skirmishes the situation is generally reversed even the car mags acknowledge this therefore they both deliver performancejust a different kind and while that may not meet your individual subjective standard but please dont denigrate cars because of that i for one would love to have an e55 which i think youll agree could blow the doors off 96 on the cars on the road todayregardless of transmissions btwapplying the personal bias youve expressed to the equation does this mean that your automatic is is not a performance car but your 5 speed is by virtue of the transmission only my wifes 03 is300 automatic is her performance car she cannot drive a manual transmission my 04 is300 manual is a performance car almost as much fun as my former 98 540i6 at half the price do i miss the 44l v8 and 6speed manual yeah but i get nearly as many smiles per mile with the 30l i6 and 5speed manual and the 540i6 didnt have lsd bmw only offers that in m3 and m5 and i can make the same case for my former 96 impala ss 57l v8 and 4speed automatic versus my former 97 camaro 38l v6 with perf handling  suspension pkg and 5speed manual take the manual any day much more fun to drive but if you like to be driven an automatic is just fine your assertion that a car must be rwd to be a true sports car is preposterous compare the is300 to the mazda 6s both cars are within a hair of each other in hp tq 060 and 14 mile acceleration skidpad grip slalom speed and braking distances even the weight distribution is close 5446 vs 5941 yes dynamically fwd and rwd perform differently from a standing start the is300 has an advantage over the mazda 6 because it has better traction to the drive wheels on a racetrack however that advantage is gone as it simply requires a different driving technique line to make a fwd go fast vs a rwd basically going around a road course quickly involves three elements  powertoweight ratio braking performance and traction in corners traction is key because the more you have the more power you can put down on the pavement the factor that most affects traction is weight transfer which is why smoothness is so important for fast lap times compared to a fwd car in a rwd car turnin happens sooner because during braking entry weight shifts away from the drive wheels and the resulting loss of traction can cause oversteer since turnin is earlier the apex also comes sooner causing the line to straighten and allow the driver to begin accelerating this technique obviously wont work well in a fwd car because the wrong wheels need the traction to exit the corner therefore weight transfer through a corner must be managed differently for a fwd car if youre piloting a fwd car into a corner you adjust your line by braking and turningin later this adjusts the line by moving the apex out farther with a later apex the fwder straightens the line through the turn and can accelerate harder sooner it may not seem as natural to you but it is no less effective at producing fast lap times as far as torque steer is concerned  no its not fun but modern high performance fwd cars like the mazda 6 or acura tl have it managed very well so if its present at all its more of a distraction than a performance handcap of course all of this talk is moot on the street at 810ths it rarely comes into play for the most fun and biggest performance gains attend a driving school and put good rubber on your wheels as far as torque steer is concerned  no its not fun but modern high performance fwd cars like the mazda 6 or acura tl have it managed very well so if its present at all its more of a distraction than a performance handcap i just drove the new tl my dinner buddy purchased last week and watched the review on the tl on speedchannelcant remember the show as i was taking one of my 14 naps over the last two weeks and so was groggy at the timebut the reviewer hammered the thing for having too much power for a front driver  all the nice sentiment over fwd is great but the platform will have a limit that this car seems to exceed the comment was the accord has about the right of poweranyone else see this so as to help me remember the show the very thing rear drivers enjoy is the differnt stlye of driving that reat powered cars afford usthat little correction to puposefully oversteer to put the car in line as the weight transfers to the drive wheels is the majic that people wont give up as a 10 year front driverthey are fun in turns  reallybut not as fun and not as easy to apex as rwd the chatter from torque steer is one of the most unsettling things you can deal with  not for fear of losing control as fwd are easier to keep in contoljust feels cruddy when your driving and it feels like an earthquake is shaking the wheeland combined with lsd and tractionits a little bit worse than my integra was ok riez well end this little chat for now but if i do get that e55 ill look you and your 5sp is up and well pick this performance discussion back up then chiao i havent driven the tl so i cannot comment on its torque steer i do admit that 270 hp is a lot to send to the front wheels that said while i dont believe fwd takes away from the fun to be had driving the tl i do suspect that its 3700 curb weight makes it more of a grand tourer than a canyon carver i would take a tsx over the tl any dayand in fact i did acura rocks in many ways  the tl is a sweet ride but it is not a sports sedan at 8595 of the envelope  while it may perform in curves nearly as well  hell even as well  better possibly with aspec it wont feel as competently done  that late turn in the fwd offers is kinda neat and i enjoyed it in the acuras ive owned and driven but the rumbling torque steer over bumps or uneven pavement is a very unimpressive offering for you and your passengers in a heavy car even the tsx may be the best value for that market segment ever its very much like the tl in terms of appearance and stancetsx owners must love it and not vice versa fedlawman please review the earlier recent posts as i said i am not talking smooth test track performance heck using that criteria a fwder with a live rear axle can be quite the performer im talking on the real roads i drive every day on the twisties on the curves on the bumps you really appreciate irs when you are taking a nice sweeper fast and you hit a bump when you lack irs the entire rear bounces up in the air and you say a silent prayer not unlike torque steer today i had fun playing with my business fwd sonata v6 5speed manual with defeatable traction control in the snow and ice she tugs and pulls like crazy every time she loses traction all that weight over the front wheels and those drive wheels trying to steer at the same time they fight for traction you fight to steer her just take a corner as you lose some front wheel traction pulls left then right laws of physics that is true for every fwder ive ever driven hard and yeah i had fun driving 01 tl type s but she torque steered same for the i35 sport i drove only way to go is to ensure the drive wheels are not the steering wheels dont forget that 5 of 3000 pounds is 150 pounds fwder is like having your preteen sitting on your hood all the time fwd vs rwd has been debated to death my personal take is that the difference is overrated mb makes rwd vehicles but how well do they handle every mb ive ever driven has been a nice car but handling wasn not really its strongest characteristic lexus makes both fwd and rwd cars but aside from riezs favorite is300 lol he has 2 of em i would really have to focus very hard to tell the difference in the drivetrain a soft plushy ride completely divorced from any feel for the road sucks whether the drivetrain is a fwd or rwd if you really want to make a performance car you not only have to have the rwd but you need to do all the other things it takes to get the weight balance as close to 5050 not sure what the exact weight balance on the is300 is riez but it doesnt sound anywhere close to 5050 so on that basis infiniti g35 and bmw are going to be a lot better than is300 also i think if you are used to a rwd and then go to a fwd the difference is really noticeable so you tend to overemphasize it the opposite is also true for example im now used to my mdx and when i had to drive an ml320 it took me a while to get used to the turns once i got used to it in 5 mins it was fine i find that as long as i have some feel for the road i can get used to just about any car and drive with my normal skill level and after a while dont notice it unless i try to go above 710ths living in the ne i prefer fwd bc i can slap on all seasons and not worry about snow tires yes you can get a rwdawd sedan but those are a lot heavier so their performance is compromised and they eat up a lot more gas when i move to ca where bad weather isnt as much of a problem id give a lot more consideration to rwd but im not going to let the drivetrain alone influence my decision as to which car i want saugatak be real just drive a fwd lexus es330 and a rwd is300 fwd cadillac seville and a rwd cadillac cts fwd lincoln continental and a rwd lincoln ls fwd infiniti i35 and a rwd infiniti g35 the list could go on and dont forget that lincoln killed the continental and cadillac is moving back to rwd for next seville not to mention chrysler and dodge going rwd for the next 300magnum platforf mb makes rwd vehicles but how well do they handle good enough to get you to 180 you are right the difference is negligible between fwd and rwd for those who cant tell the difference however i believe you underestimate the number of people who can tell the difference for those that can tell the difference the difference is real and its spectacular riez try comparing apples to apples if you absolutely must not apples and oranges saugatak is right about this fwdrwd thing being way overblown 99 of the drivers on the road including you unless you have a professional racers license wont notice a bit of difference in their morning commutes to the office the overwhelming mass of opinions either way have been driven by the marketing spin of the manufacturers and the auotmotive press we bite into something that sounds good and promote it as gospel when for the vast majority of usit makes absolutely no difference youve found a ride you really like were all glad for you why spoil it for everyone else who may like something different cant both decisions be valid all fwd cars you mentioned are soft and there were build to be soft how about rwd crown vic or town car they are also soft why dont you compare your beloved is to mazda 6 or tsx and you know what saab will out handle your is any time saugatak is right about this fwdrwd thing being way overblown 99 of the drivers on the road including you unless you have a professional racers license wont notice a bit of difference in their morning commutes to the office  this is where i say the car matters little and we should all be driving hyundais and buying mcmansions with the money that has grown out of the investments we have made because of the cars that we bought ppcan you way torque steer the saab really doesnt count lets put a supercharger on the is and then give it a shot might as well compare the mazda 6 to an evo yes if you take the worst handling fwd cars and compare them to good handling rwd cars then you are right but the point of the post which you clearly missed is that first you have to make a good handling car and then putting in a rwd drivetrain will make a difference i think a more valid comparison is the es330 vs gs300 both offer soft plush rides with little road feel es330 has too little power to have any torque steer does the drivetrain really make a difference i mean how much do i care that a bad handling rwd car might handle slightly better than a bad handling fwd car i would never push a bad handlng rwd car to the limits anyway so what have i gained with the rwd drivetrain riez its great you love your is300 so much that you got 2 of em lol but theres a lot more to handling than drivetrain and you know it ok kd time to retire the hyundai bit like i had to do with my real lexus spiel hello everyone i test drove both a honda accord coupe ex v6 with nav and the 325xi yesterday its very interesting to me that the accord popped up a few times in this thread about near luxury cars i must say that the 240hp accord seemed more powerful than the bmw with only marginally worse handling granted i was not on a race track but this is everyday driving i also must say that this accord had every possible option and is 4000 cheaper than the bmw that has almost no options not even power seats i was amazed that you could actually talk to the navigation system finally i was amazed at how plush the honda was and how spartan the bmw was the bmw was almost embarassingly uncomfortable on the inside all this being said can anyone really justify goping with the bmw here also can anyone justify spending 4k more for the acura tl maybe go for the bmw because of 1 all wheel drive and 2 prestige of driving a bmw please let me know thank you i dont understand why is that saab does not count because it stepped on your toes we are talking about stock cars without any additions from after market hey saab does not have 30 v6 like is does riez and kd i wonder how far you two push you rwd cars i have a tl and i really in to cars so i have driven quiet a few rwd and fwd cars with that said do you really know your cars limits i bet you dont because if you do you must of crash it a few times or be really close to it to understand were exactly the limit is in order to compare rwd and fwd you really have to spend alot of time driving each one and really push it to the limit and that would only be possible only on the race trace or on the empty road at night i dont think any of you two had this kind of experience and for this meter so as anybody else on this side including myself so if you think that rwd is better than fwd that is your opinion not a fact and it varies from car to car while 330 in my opinion has a slight advantage over tl in handling there is no way you can take advantage of it as for is in my opinion it does not even handle as good as tl so just leave it a that ppit was written tongue in cheekforgot the smiley but to answer the question i push the car pretty darn hard i dont drive to smash er up or to race it but the predictable response smooth drivetrain and communicative steering lets me do almost anything now could a professional push it harder absolutely honda accord v6 to a bmw 325 for 28000 to me its no contest the honda is very nice at that price i never go for loaded cars but there is a certain level of options that i want a 28000 bmw does not have it having just driven a loaded honda accord i can say it drives very nicely could i see myself driving it absolutely does it handle anywhere close to my 330i not a chance but if the sport in sports sedan doesnt matter its a compelling choice i have a tl and i really in to cars so i have driven quiet a few rwd and fwd cars me too including a 911 so if you think that rwd is better than fwd that is your opinion not a fact and it varies from car to car while 330 in my opinion has a slight advantage over tl in handling there is no way you can take advantage of it pp  i agree if youre idea of handling is to plow threw snow with allseasons a fwd will outdo a rwd but i can feel the difference between a great fwd and a great rwd it is no contest does it make a difference going to work on traffic clogged streets no but that is not what this conversation is about or else we would all be driving hyundais sorry shenkar thats the last of it a great rwd will be able to outperform in the aggregate a great fwd because of the balance and power delivery as i said it doesnt make a difference in traffic cloggeds streets but that is not what this conversation is about what drivetrain one chooses is a personal preference they each have their advantages and limitations but lets not confuse the ability of the car with the ability of the driver or amount of traffic on the road tomorrow tues 16 im gonna drive my beautifully maintained low mileage158k 2001 maxima gle loaded  chrome wheels meridianthe worksto a fella who has a 1999 bmw 328i 5spd also loaded w 664k am i nuts or what i have about 45k equity in the nissan with a 7 year mfg warranty and all i have done for nearly 3 years is fill up the tank and change the oil every 34kit handles great imo  im just looking for something sporty thats more fuel efficient and i havent had a manual in about 10 years and think it would be fun again am i nuts or whatare the bimmers really the ultimate driving machine or am i in for a nasty surprise when the snow flies or when i need the notoriously expensive repairs electrical done any and all comments will be gladly accepted when does bmw recommend enginetiming beltradiator etc serviceat 6070k like most foreign cars thanks in advance chuck objectively speaking its hard to beat an accord v6 coupe manual for a combo of fun and practicality anything beyond that is for the fun and prestige factor how much that fun and prestige are worth is up to you if youre considering the accord you might also want to give the tl a shot if you dont want the nav the tl can be had for up to 2k off msrp in some areas at which point it doesnt cost more than a comparable accord if youre considering the accord you might also want to give the tl that 7k represents the difference between the tl and the 330i the same 7k that has been beat to death as part of the value equation the overwhelming mass of opinions either way have been driven by the marketing spin of the manufacturers and the auotmotive press we bite into something that sounds good and promote it as gospel when for the vast majority of usit makes absolutely no difference youve found a ride you really like were all glad for you why spoil it for everyone else who may like something different cant both decisions be valid there is no voodoo or gospel here and no marketing hype marketing hype is what got fwd to suceed rwd platfroms offer a lot of good things to a paltform and it makes sense to improve the design of autos fwd is a thing of the past i would bet by 2010 rwd with traction control is great for 60 of the country and the rest will be offered awd or ateesa type systems the argument that fwd is a good decision isnt invalidated yet neither can you say that its hype that gets people demanding rwd cars balance is not just weight distributionits also which way the weight shift when you floor it rwd is not bad  in fact its merits i believe and not hype got it on the comeback trail has a car ever competed with bmw before 02 in the entry lux arena there were plenty of attempts with fwd but none suceeded until g35 out rwd sedan if youre considering the accord you might also want to give the tl that 7k represents the difference between the tl and the 330i the same 7k that has been beat to death as part of the value equation ______________ the accord i can get for 26265k fully loaded the bmw will be 30k minimum the point is that if i am going to spend the extra money on a car i want it to be a bmw not an acura to me the whole point of the accord is saving the  and getting the options my whole point of a bmw is the fact that it has the prestige of bmw therefore it makes no sense to me to spend 30k on an acura thereby not getting the prestige but still spening the  has a car ever competed with bmw before 02 in the entry lux arena there were plenty of attempts with fwd but none suceeded until g35 out rwd sedan specifically the 3series though its ironic above 40k there is not a lot of competition in the fwd space aside from the acura rl what other vehicle is fwd the is is a competitor and was not overlooked however i still think the styling of the is300 is racerlike and not really world class that would keep me from getting it although riez loves his certainly not as nice looking as the sc430 ahemdoes anyone out there have some definative figures covering sales of fwd vs rwd by car segment and or makemodel perhaps some hard data could help settle this raging inferno i cant see anything else that will cause at the end of the dayeverything else is completely subjective thank you for you attention as he steps down off his soap box  joke what is a fwd porsche a vw what is a fwd bmw an audi what is a fwd bentley a rickshaw notice that premium marques like bmw excluding the mini brand but that is a unique situation and mb dont use fwd guess their buyers are just uneducated about the benefits of fwd notice that supercar manufacturers like ferrari aston martin lambro etc dont use fwd guess their buyers are just uneducated about the benefits of fwd does honda use fwd in its nsx supercar honda knows the difference between fwd and rwd do mazda and toyota use fwd for performance cars like miata or mr2 they know the difference between fwd and rwd cars the accord i can get for 26265k fully loaded with nav tell me where and ill be there in a flash to purchase it new 0 miles out the door even edmunds tmv estimates about 275k bmw is the fact that it has the prestige of bmw lets see honda has value bmw has prestige sort of ignored the equation in the middle why someone would want to purchase any car i could purchase a car much less expensive with much more value than a honda and equal reliability lets try it this way honda has a reputation for providing value in its cars bmw has a reputation for building cars with a level of luxury and performance thats a much better way of saying honda has value bmw has prestige shenkar  please dont fall into the trap of using sales figures as an estimate of the goodness or best of technology camry is still the best selling vehicle in america i guess that means its technology sets the standard right fwd reliable appliance right why arent we all buying them riez i agree kd i agree i guess what im trying to get at is the relavance of this fight were having here i still say for most people driving on public roads in america the realworld performance differences are negligible at bestnonexistent at worst i currently own both fwd and rwd vehicles and i love them all they all do exactly what i need them to do so does that mean that my rwd mercedes sedans are superior to my 04 fwd nissan quest van certainly not based on drivetrain configuration alone there are a very few situations where one or the other will clearly be preferrable but in most other situations they will be interchangable i just dont believe there are absolutes when discussing the average driver on the average road here in america and id be so bold as to say that includes every single one of us unless you reside in nevada or utah or the like were fundamentally arguing our preferences and prejudices in the main and i dont see the need for that since they both are valid in most situations i still say for most people driving on public roads in america the realworld performance differences are negligible at bestnonexistent at worst the rear drivers will never let this go the driving dynamic is desirable and evident all the time  and i would suggest most of on this board would be above average in our expectations for performance and platform you dont have to go to utah to enjoy the dynamics there may be no merit in arguing which is better f or r drive but there is no way you can say a rwd car is never enjoyed or worth it or needed the cars may be interchangable most of the time if you want to get there but the desirable charachteristics of rwd are there to enjoy all the time and the preference is more than fluff i thought this was a forum about bmw 3series but looks like im in the middle of an arguement about fwd vs rwd so ok any comments on how a 328i or any 3 series handles on snowy winding hills such as we have here in western pa i can alway just load up the trunk wsandbagshow about midto long term reliability issues any firsthand experiences with problems after 5 years in a 3 series i understand electrical glitches are very common but not usually very serious so ok any comments on how a 328i or any 3 series handles on snowy winding hills such as we have here in western pa change pa to ny or nj and heres my take the handling will be compromised at best without snow tires this applies to any rwd vehicle preferably 4 good snows will make a big difference chrisboth  fwd is a thing of the past\\nsince it is cheaper for manufacturers to use fwd and serves to make smaller and lighter cars which translates to better gas mileage then no you wont see that happen but if i were to entertain your idea for a moment and throw away all benefits to a manufacturer id have to say both rwd and fwd will be in the past and everything will be awd as far as the rwd vs fwd id like to do as i say above and jump on the side of awd if its good enough for some top supercars and exotics its good enough for me as far as the rwd vs fwd id like to do as i say above and jump on the side of awd awd does add weight lower fuel efficiency and compromise handling the tradeoff is the ability to handle torque with the loss of balance posed by the additional hardware but to some the tradeoff is worth it and lets not forget the obvious advantage in any conditions other than dry pavement why do you think awd compromises handling  several years ago when audi introduced awd in their german series racing cars they dominated the racing series and attributed it to the awd they were forced to add a great deal of weight to their cars in order to try and make the series fair what part of awd do you feel compromises handling and why  the accord i can get for 26265k fully loaded with nav tell me where and ill be there in a flash to purchase it new 0 miles out the door even edmunds tmv estimates about 275k 265k is the street price of a new exv6 nav check the accord prices board edmunds tmv tends to be conservative the exv6 can be had for 24k itll depend on location it is not out the door since it doesnt take into account taxes title registration etc but the same can be said for any car when comparing prices who are you talking to i didnt see anyone say that maybe a post was deleted i dunno oh unless you interpret me saying some of the supercars as meaning most dont well i didnt want to get into an argument about semantics so i was being conservative fact is not all are rwd so obviously highend manufacturers dont necessarily believe rwd is the endallbeall of performance thats all i was saying i was thinking the same thing but then looked up the g35 sedan in both rwd and awd and motortrend lists 651 mph slalom for awd and 659 mph slalom for rwd still extremely close and could easily be attributed to being tested on different days and maybe even different locations and maybe even by a different driver but not provable so there is really no arguing it given 2 identical cars in every other way accept drivetrain configuration the extra weight of awd will most likely lose but again on a dry course oh and also as long as its a car that doesnt have so much power that it would merely smoke the rear wheels while powering out of the turns oh and also as long as its a car that doesnt have so much power that it would merely smoke the rear wheels while powering out of the turns the new to be e60 m5 39 to 60 rwd you dont need awd to do it its just another option just like fwd but it does add extra weight reduce gas mileage sure manufacturers have used it to lay power down 4 wheels at a time i was not talking about driving in snow or in the have traffic i was talking about driving at the high speed and passing cars left and right i also think that you will not be able to achieve more in rwd over fwd i was also asuming that one should have the same experience driving both fwd and rwd you clearly dont have that for example i passed 330 on the i95 the other day and guess what he almost killed himself trying to catch me i was driving my friend rav4 does it mean rav4 is a better car that 330 no it means the guy cant drive with that said i think that 99 of the population will not be able to take advantage of rwd and another 1 race car drivers will be smart enof not to do it if you live in the north east should you get awd 330 over a rwd 330 if soemone was given a choice what is the downside to choosing the awd if there is any obviously the downside to the rwd is handling in less then clear dry conditions all other things being equal awd adds weight complexity usually price and often eats up some interior or trunk space eg see vw passat of course it can improve traction but tires are the single most important component for traction get the best tires money can buy when looking at test results you have to look at what track track conditions drivers tires methodology etc keep in mind that f1 nascar etc all have arbitrary rules nascar uses live axles and carburetors i cant hardly spell this archaic word much more powerful f1 cars have various restrictions on engine size etc f1 cars in early 1980s put out 1200 hp today they are more like 900 or so hp there is no racing series i know reputable and offical that allows an absolute freeforall for carsany size weight engine size any engine configuration turbos superchargers nitrous oxide or other performance enhancers awd etc would be fascinating you right about tires its very important when it comes to handling if you live in the north east should you get awd 330 over a rwd 330 if soemone was given a choice what is the downside to choosing the awd if there is any obviously the downside to the rwd is handling in less then clear dry conditions im fairly certain i would have passed on a 330i with awd i dont like the understeer then neutral then oversteer drive feel of an awd car my friends wrx is a fun highly modded car but the awd system makes me very happy to get back into my rwd 330i additionally im not impressed by the higher maintenance costs lower mileage and added weight btw i live in southern california so awd is really only for the snowboarders and therock climbers not many of us face weather that needs awd i agree that a well built well designed performance car with rwd is the best handling sedan out there on nonsnowy roads in 2002 in the northeast when there were a lot of snowstorms rwd cars without snowtires got stuck on the road if my ride were a bmw 330 not an all wheel drive id have to buy at least 2 snow tires for the rear wheels and hang on to them then id have to go to the mechanic to get them installed before the snowstorm hits oh no everyone else is on line doing the same thing and the mechanic cant get to me too bad now im stuck on snow roads with regular tires in a rwd car oh damn now i just got stuck and have to walk home in 2 foot snow while getting snowsprayed by all the fwd cars going through no problem or better yet i just spun out but before i crashed i was thinking well this is a small price to pay for having a rwd performance car in ny i drive a fwd car out of choice bc i have gotten stuck in snow in rwd cars but i have never gotten stuck in a fwd car and yes i did have an awd audi but the extra weight on the car made the car really slow and a gas hog and what happens if i trade in the car and it uses different size tires now i have to get new snow tires and try to sell the old ones good luck getting value for those old snow tires in sum rwd in a good performance car gives best performance but that dont mean much in snow awd gives best snow performance but on dry roads its slower the heavier weight of the car affects its turning ability and when you have to do a lot of turning the software on the awd system gets confused so the car acts schizophrenic fwd doesnt give as good a performance in snow as awd but its usually good enough and its performance on dry roads is second to rwd but better than awd and it usually has the best gas mileage i think that manufacturers will continue to make fwd rwd and awd cars to suit different tastes and climates since the camcord are the best selling cars and theyre fwd plus they show no signs of giving up the sales crown i disagree with your contention that fwd cars are a thing of the past check out the february 2004 issue of cr as they put it most of their favorite v6 family sedans like the accord camry and passat scored higher in our tests than most of the vehicles in this category and they cost about 3000 to 9000 less if you want to see how the 330i and is300 stack up you have to pull out the may 2001 issue of cr speaking of tires 330i was nonsport pkg and rode on 20550r17 93v mediocre continental contitouringcontact tires tl rode on bridgestone turanza el42 p23545r17 93w tires is300 rode on goodyear eagle gsd 21545zr17 87w tires for those who love numbers with each being tested with an automatic transmission 600 mph dry braking is300 128 ft tl 130 ft and 330i 131 ft avoidance maneuver is300 57 mph 330i 555 mph and tl 525 mph 060 mph 330i 66 secs tl 67 secs and is300 74 secs 4565 mph tl 42 secs is300 44 secs and 330i 53 secs 14 mile 330i 151 secs tl 152 secs and is300 157 secs cr clearly points out that the tl cannot handle like the 330i or is300 overall fuel economy tl 23 mpg 330i 22 mpg and is300 21 mpg predicted reliability is300 best rating with tl and 330i getting next best rating in original test in todays data is300 retains best rating and 330i has fallen to only average reliability interesting that of the 15 cars in their upscale sedan category the fwders finished 1st 4th 9th 10th 11th 14th and 15th the rwders finished 2nd 3rd 5th 6th 8th and 12th the awders finished 7th and 13th say the rwders win this one the tls biggest handicap vs the is300 and 330i isnt its drivetrain its curb weight fwd is inherently front heavy and it asks the drive wheels to steer fwd cannot overcome the laws of physics which is one reason there is no fwd supercar a fwder and rwder of the same total weight will not have that weight evenly distributed that weight distribution penalty causes an inherent disadvantage and since the best tires can go on any vehicle the fwder cannot overcome its limitations by using better rubber were all of the vehicles equipped the same  as in all had manual trans  the car and driver test of the tl showed much better 060 times\\n 57 as i recall and i know it was the manual trans much worse braking  180 some feet i think  a nice set of comparison numbers you put together however cr road test all vehicles have at riez i think we all agree that tires men a lot when it comes to handling\\nhere is some stats for you bridgestone turanza el42 p23545r17 93w  handling rating  580 dry traction  630 wet traction  51\\ngoodyear eagle gsd 21545zr17 87w tires handling rating  880 dry traction  920 wet traction  910\\ncontitouringcontact 20550r17 93v tires handling rating  830 dry traction  870 wet traction  77 the number are based on 10 point system and taken from tire rack as you can see tl has the worse tires by far this is why tl scored marginally lover in handling and accelerations tests plus as somebody mentioned tl is also heavier with that said  if you put the same tires on all three vehicles you will get almost identical numbers in handling raher i wrote for those who love numbers with each being tested with an automatic transmission they were all tested by cr with 5speed automatic transmissions do keep in mind that you have to pay careful attention to the test methodology if you study the fine print of rt mt and cd youll see how they do theirs tells how they achieve maximum 060 mph times eg high rpm drop clutch and whether they publish actual results what they did that day on that track at that altitude at that temperature or adjusted results mathematically altering the data for temperature etc thinking cd and mt publish adjusted results and rt publishes actual results also thinking rt discusses how results within a certain range are essentially statistically not different i prefer their methodology even though cd is much more enjoyable to read pg48477 not familiar with these numbers what is their methodolgy are these objective numbers eg each tire is tested on the same car with the same driver on the same track at the same temperature etc or subjective guestimates do you happen to know the dot grades temperature wear and traction for each of these tires the contitouringcontacts are not a performance tire continental contisportcontacts and contisportcontact 2s are continentals highest performing tires my wifes 00 323ia had the tourings i put a set of sportcontact 2s on my 98 540i6 world of difference crs 330i would have handled and braked much better if it had had the optional sport pkg which it did not the sport pkg provides improved suspension setting and better tires eg a tire like the sportcontact youll notice that the tl rode on the widest tires 235 mm much much wider than the 330is a mere 205 mm and much wider than the is300s just 215 mm tire width means bigger contact patch all other things equal a wider tire should improve braking and most handlingrelated numbers in the realm of tires a 30 mm width difference is like the grand canyon thinking 25 mm is approx 1 inch you right tl has wider tires but its not always good why you think most powerful rwd cars have thinner tires on the front wheels it gives some but it also takes some as for tire rack data i dont know how they came up with it but i know that tire rack is one of the best stores when it comes to tires if you want go to tirerackcom and get all details you need cr judged the tl to be better than bmw 330i lexus es and is mb c320 infiniti g35 and a host of others carsperiod why are you wasting our time with 3 year old data cr may have given the overall nod to the tl but every other magazine in the world says the bmw 3series sets the benchmark for its combination of of performance and luxury there are no buts about that the tl still cannot match the bmws overall performance and as cd notes the braking from 70 is way behind the 330i so while i dont begrudge the tl top spot in cr it doesnt mean its really best in class just best in value the 3 series redesign is now a few years old to have every other magazine still note its the benchmark except for one says mountains about the car do you think the acura will remain on the top for 4 years in a row and while nobody needs an bmw acura or even an expensive honda or mazda they also note the accord is almost as good as the tl for 7k less that does not say a lot about the tl so they say the accord is almost as good as the tl for 7k less and the tl is almost as good as the bimmer for 8k less i think it says alot about the tl and sorry but based on the numbers provided here by bimmer lovers the tl is much closer to the bmw than the tl is to the accord with that said i think that 99 of the population will not be able to take advantage of rwd and another 1 race car drivers will be smart enof not to do it  have you ever driven a rwd car that atually rocks without reading back i would guess if you own a rwd it must be a lincoln you dont have to be on the edge of the traction envelope to enjoy rwd or benefit from it shall we say that assertation above is hilarious the two platforms are so different in fundamanetal and basic engineering that they are entirely different beasts just because fwd works well 99 of the time more like 8590 does not mean it works as well you dont have to be andretti to take an apex with enough velocity to enjoy the line and balance that only comes in rwd if 99 cant enjoy the benes than why are they demanding every manufacturer in the us put a rwd sedan in thier lineup tl is almost as good as the bimmer for 8k less i think it says alot about the tl im not sure i walked away with that impression so you have a car that doesnt handle nearly as well yet a better entry sports sedan i bought the 3series for its handling ride luxury spotonsteering not for the mark levinson stereo for once im in complete agreement with chrisboth are you kidding most of us are stuck in traffic every day and what do you do when the snow falls at what speed is your rwd traction envelope then less than the tls for sure are you kidding most of us are stuck in traffic every day and what do you do when the snow falls at what speed is your rwd traction envelope then less than the tls for sure correct but my awd suv has a higher threshold than the tl and over 25 feet of snow on the ground wont stop it so what is the point how fast we can all drive through snow so you have a car that doesnt handle nearly as well yet a better entry sports sedan huh i didnt say it was better are you kidding most of us are stuck in traffic every day and what do you do when the snow falls at what speed is your rwd traction envelope then less than the tls for sure  i take the train to wrok traffic makes me crazy so i choose sanity if i can i live in this horrible infrastructure in philly and work in the city so driving happens elsewhere and when it snows i use the awd suv we just purchasedliving in canada you may have to make these compromises to get an all season car not really so bad here in fact the g with turanzas is fine in upto 3 inches or so that means i cant drive the g about 1 day 4 days a year i still put 12k a year on my car on trips to nc and trips to the mountains and on my infamous 4am speed runs to a wawa off the ne extension if it snows tho those will be performed using the suv and will feauture a run or two at blue mountain is that blue mountain ski resort just north of allentown are you kidding most of us are stuck in traffic every day and what do you do when the snow falls at what speed is your rwd traction envelope then less than the tls for sure what does traffic have to do with the cars ability to perform or anything that is germane to this conversation or the way it drives either way id still rather be stuck in my 3series than any other vehicle yes it is not much but they open at 730 on weekends i can usually get in and out of there by 9 and avoid the crowds altogether jays peak is next week tho i dont own a rwd but i drive g35 coupe 6mt almost every other day how about you it looks like you lucking some experience kd why dont you stop you ridiculous comments in regards to tl and accord it just does not make any sense i told you many times accord to tl is like 325 to 330 why did you get 330 you could have saved 20k and get 325 ppmy comments make plenty of sense since there were a lot of threads devoted to value you cant have it both ways either value is in the equation or not people seem to say the tl is more than 7k less than the 330i and is better value i point out that cr says the accord is about 7k less then the tl and its almost as good why do you think this being ridiculous are we talking capabilities or value i dont own a rwd but i drive g35 coupe 6mt almost every other day how about you it looks like you lucking some experience does this say lacking some experience or liking some exper u is nect to i on my keyboard so ill assume you mean like i drive a sedan and it get better every day the coupe is great but too small for me to climb into at my age and size there are few perceptible performance differences other than what is gleaned in the 1 inch drop the coupe gets the car is fun to play with and make minor mods to that add hp to get it easily up to the 280290 level the coupe is at i think its ridiculous because accord is not near luxury performance sedan and it have nothing to do with this discussion now why dont you answer my question why did you get 330 you could have saved 20k and get 325 for the same reason people got the tl over the hyundai i wanted it i could afford it no more no less if that means im a poseur so be it the car still drives the same whether a poseur is driving it or not my mistake i ment lacking have you driven any fwd cars recently  for extended period of time you are a funny gay do you know that honda and hyundai are two different car companies\\ni thought 325 made by bmw i did not know its build by hyundai people seem to say the tl is more than 7k less than the 330i and is better value i point out that cr says the accord is about 7k less then the tl and its almost as good why do you think this being ridiculous are we talking capabilities or value what is the difference value should by definition take all aspects of the purchase into account including capabilities weighing the capabilities and content against the cost equates the value so i say again the tl is a better value because it is closer in capability to the 330 than the accord is to the tl in other words the 7k price hike to get the tl over the accord nets you much greater results than the 7k price hike although its even more than that to get the 330 over the tl i let the numbers of the tl versus the 330 that all you bimmerownerslovers speak for themselves i dont have the time to sit here and set up a 3way chart for ya my mistake i ment lacking have you driven any fwd cars recently  for extended period of time  i have had 2 crxs sis one civic hatchback circa  1982 a 1993 acura integra 3 door and a 2002 passat total fwd miles 250k or more all told and i beat the snot out of each car and took it to trade with so many problems they should be totalled since fixing costs were  value fixed i mean beat hard ps they were fun but ill never go back balance balance balance in other words the 7k price hike to get the tl over the accord nets you much greater results than the 7k price hike although its even more than that to get the 330 over the tl actually the 7k to get from the accord to the tl doesnt get you 7k worth of benefit toward the bimmer in fact in the tl it may get you marginally closer to handling on the bimmer but not 7k worth but the fact the bimmer has performance handling characteristics neither car can match i dont have time to detail it for you but im sure you know what i mean what does traffic have to do with the cars ability to perform or anything that is germane to this conversation or the way it drives either way id still rather be stuck in my 3series than any other vehicle my point is that in the real world rwd has its limitations in cases of snow fwd has the advantage as for awd suvs thats the biggest joke you would not believe how many suvs get towed out of snow banks and ditches in toronto after a snow storm  way too many ive been driving fwds in snow for 14 years and never ever got stuck as for being stuck in traffic if your car is not moving rwd offers no advantages and i rather be in a car with the worlds best factory stereo system for any length of time youre back to the environment of the car rather than the abilities of the car a rwd with 4 snows will handle just as well as a fwd with snow a rwd with allseasons will be outhandled by a fwd kahuna  youre logic is the very reason that most every driver in an urban area ought to be driving hyundais yet its not happening btw from everything ive heard and read unless the tl has dvdaudio the stereo is nothing special i dont know first hand id rather be listening to an ml anyday if i cant do that id rather drive the bimmer anyway since were talking about unused capabilities why dont you drive a honda accord and save yourself 7k if you are sitting in traffic you have unused capabilities especially with the inbound toronto traffic in the morning4k for a good aftermarket stereo along with a honda could still save you money over a tl as for awd suvs thats the biggest joke they owners are a joke fwd is not as capable as awd there cant be argument here can there be perhaps the awd owners should learn how to drive and recognize that awd doesnt make for better stopping while fw is almost as good as all wheel it is not better and i see tons of suvs that people in co seem to put off road in snow banks and medians all the time  they are all 4 wheel drive not awdhuge difference people dont go into 4wd when they should and leave it 2 wheels usually rear btw from everything ive heard and read unless the tl has dvdaudio the stereo is nothing special this proves that you know very little about this car ive heard the stereo first hand and the dvd is great but for regular cds  its on par with the bose system from the g35 its good even really good but no better tl has a great interior  one of the best but the car is not a top line sports sedan by virtue of the limitations that several editors and testers have all consistently harped it for fwd there is little else to know once these facts are revealed to rwd fans its on deaf ears no sorry i have no idea what you mean but honestly im not trying to knock anyones choice im just trying to defend what i found to be a great car referring to the tl and if the only advantage that can be stated for buying the bmw over the tl is that extra 5 g of roadholding ability thats just not going to pursuade me to fork over all that extra money and according to cd even the accord coupe you are fond of mentioning is faster in the quarter mile than the 330 with performance pack but there is so much more to consider aside from numbers the tl is quieter quicker better handling more solid better shifter better clutch better interior materials etc over the accord i cant say all that regarding the bmw there is nothing wrong with you having and enjoying your rwd car for nonsnow occasions and getting an awd suv for snowy occasions its your money and its your choice how to spend it as someone currently living in nyc and paying close to 400 a month in garage fees id be paying nearly 5k a year in parking fees alone to be able to do what youre doing i frankly dont enjoy the advantages of rwd so much that ill pay the extra in parking fees so i choose to go with fwd your categorical statement there is little else to know once these facts are revealed to rwd fans its on deaf ears is just plain wrong people have needs budgets space limitations plus a desire to simplify ones life something to be said for not having to worry about maintenance insurance registration etc for another car when you can only drive one at a time seems like a big waste to have 2 cars for yourself when you can get by with one but i realize my personal minimalist philosophy of trying not to clutter your life with too many things is not for everyone btw if you live in philly have you tried morimotos restaurant its great i highly recommend the top of the line omakase for us subaru fans smile time is coming really soon dont get me wrong i like the updated acura tl infiniti g35 wawd but if you have driven a legacy you know the potential was there a good car waiting for an engine well now we have the engine i cant wait to see the new legacy vs the rest of the near luxury sport sedanswagons httpwwwneeddesirecommainhtml sign of things to come 250hp\\n060  55 secs are you looking for performance\\nare you looking for luxury\\nare you looking for value\\nwhat are you willing to pay\\nhow important are other factors like reliability crash test results practicality etc think we can all agree that the 325i and 330i are highly related and that the accord v6 sedan and tl are highly related heck for that matter the tsx is the european accord if all you worry about is a boring commute save money and buy an inexpensive car or maybe a used car but if driving pleasure is your goal then just any old car wont do and if you want the best you are willing to pay for it special order it wait for it etc like i said before too bad we cant break this board into 3 boards rwd fwd and awd i cant imagine owning a high performance fwder to me there is no such thing obviously others disagree looks like subaru is finally serious about competing with the germans and the other japanese auto makers notice the new legacy borrows a few styling cues from both the new and old acura tl

others dont i like both equally330 better exterior tl better interior so lit say its a tie value goes hands down to tl i think most us will agree i think you cant include handling because you already got a point for performance i would also give tl a point for features but im not gona because its part of the value price i think all agree tl gets the point cost to lease will go to tl lease for a none nav tl about 420450 including tax and maybe another 1500 for all fees total  17700 plus oil change 400 18100\\n330 performance pakg lease is close to 550600 including tax plus fees 1500  23100 so i say tl is a winner as for me if i could have lease loaded 330 for the same money as tl i would do it but it is at least 100 more a month i think we all agree that performance is marginally better or i should say handling so i ll give this to 330just to make you happy no i meant performance cost to leasetieyou can get that down to about 500520 making it about 19k or so for a car thats 10 grand more paying a few dollars more isnt a big deal btw im paying just slightly more than 18k for mine just want to know that a fabulous deal cause friend who has a 2003 tl is paying way more than that almost as much as my bimmer goodies  tl value  3 seriescause it has everything i want and nothing i dont if i thought the tl had more overall value i would have gotten it value is the feeling for the priority of the intangibles and tangibles combined price  tl winner us the analysis is flawed you may have given the right answer to each question or factor but if you do not assign equal weight to each question or factor you have reached the wrong conclusion case in point kd may want to assign 50 points to performance because he is a performance fanatic and only 5 points to value because he is loaded and doesnt mind spending more money if you tally the score based on weighted answers your conclusion could very well be flawed unless you all agree to the amount of weight to be given to each question or factor and i can assure you that you will never agree the entire exercise is futile  if i thought the tl had more overall value i would have gotten it since you have a 2002 bmw which model year tl were you referring to i think we all agree that we are winners in choices that we maid kd you got a grate deal when i was shopping for a car the best price i got for loaded 330 was 650 but that was a while ago\\nas for tl i got my s type for 450 when they just came out could have shaved another 2030 off but did not want wait right now you can get nonnav 04 tls in atlanta for 399 plus

impartial rational fair openminded or sane for that matter they just try to beat you into submission with their my cars greatbut your car stinks arguments will the madness ever end sigh on that price though how is your 330 equipped i like the tie idea works for me pg48477 you wrote how you figure that is has better styling and goodies styling is inherently subjective the cts tl and maxima are all way too angularly styled for my taste trying to be overly modern the 3 series is tasteful but a bit bland i think the is300 is the best balance of tasteful and modern as for goodies is300 has a ton including the most important of all lsd 3 series can only be had with lsd in m3 version cybersol cr ranks the g35 12th out of the 15 cars in their upscale sedan category crs full test of the g35 sedan was in the july 2003 issue in that test it came out fourth behind the lincoln ls6 cadillac cts and nissan maxima 35 se but ahead of the saab 93 vector they tested a g35 automatic test data dry braking

compared to tls 235s predicted reliability 2nd best rating notice the above time is the worst ever published for the sedan id take my grounding wired g35 against a tl and feel pretty confident id tie or better 50 of the time 68 is bad the 5at records 62 and the 6mt is approx 5559 4565 tells all about the power of the these motors anyone care to put up those numbers comparing tl3is remember to take into account equipment on the tested car the bmw 330i was not tested with its most valuable sport package dont believe the g35 had its either so they ran on terrible tires also you have to take into account crs methodology compare that to methodology of car magazines auto press usually uses whatever most aggressive method at launch and remember that cr does not get its cars from the manufacturers it buys real cars off real dealers lots is easy for manufacturers to give car magazines ringers the ultimate argument does not hold water performance figures do not indicate a 330i will be seeing the taillights of any car in this category the cars the 330i will see the taillights of so will the tl and g35 since i have no plans on racing you on the street and potentially hurting myself or other drivers i will have to leave it to people who measure such things even with crs testing methodolody g35 came in behind 330i its not about the 330i being faster its about the 330i being the more expensive holding its own against cars having bigger engines with a 35 hptorque advantage and while the 330i may lose the quarter mile to a g35 it loses by 1 second to a car with a 5 liter bigger engine riez  i believe is correct that car mags use a doordie method to get the absolute fastest time you wouldnt necessarily want to do that to your car cr probably uses a more conservative approach where drivetrain parts do not get strewn all over the tarmac not knocking either car you cant dismiss the performancehandling aspect of the 3series while extolling the value aspect of either car chrisboth  show me one review where the g35 sedan 6mt has a 55 time to 60 at work there is a nice g35 with 18 wheels lowered some that looks awesome someone also bought the new tl which is very good looking also i just went to the la auto show and saw the tl aspec very impressive you can battle these two all day long and all you get is bloody there is no winner they are both super nice enthusiasts always talk about rwd as preference but if you look at many of the touring racing formats you see that fwd does pretty well both the acura rsx and mazda 3 have been championship winners in the touring classes against bmw you g35 tl  is300 worshipers are gonna be upset when the new 2005 legacy finally hits the shores performance and handling will leave those behind the legacy has already bettered a rs6 at a track in japan i say it here now so you wont be disappointed when the mags say it later the bmw 330 perf audi s4 and volvo s60rv70r will get their lickings also i cant comment on the interior until i see it in person although it is gonna be steps ahead the legacy gt is another one im looking forward to but id be surprised if it bests the others it will probably be faster in a straight line with a tall clutch dump but on a track they will be much closer unless subaru finally puts a real sporting suspension on a nonsti product its not going to be very tossable you g35 tl  is300 worshipers are gonna be upset when the new 2005 legacy finally hits the shores performance and handling will leave those behind i say it here now so you wont be disappointed when the mags say it later  this car may be geared to get to 60 in less than 6 but lets see the real numbers when tested and see the rest of the story i expect it to be a solid car but i doubt 3g lovers are weeping just yet 250 hp spread to 4 wheels is about what an a4 isfun but no m5 if you review the few mag articles that relate specifically to the gt they mention how balanced the handling is the rub has always been the lack of power and the interior refinement i can buy an srt4 for cheap put 10k worth of mods in it and blow everything away but i ask myself is this the car i really wanna drive what does the ability to outgun every car with one that has not even a modicum of luxury have to do with anything yes youll lose the race but im sure you will think look at that guy in the cheap modded american car compared to my fancy aspec tl for mountain highway travel canyon carving and all purpose driving the legacy has always been a sleeper it now finally will have the engine the chassis deserves drive a leagcy in the mountains and you will know what i am talking about if you want mods then wait till the sti legacy comes rumour is 350400 hp turbo h6 to match up directly with s4   thats more like it400 hp is the benchmark  i hope everyone has an offering with that in mind it will come down to pricing if these makers can really produce what they say they arepretty comparable carsthe car that we infiniti enthusiast long await is called skylinegtr and it will have near 500 hp for a speculated 55k or so and look like a cross between a g and a bugatti and a viper the 20062008 car shopping seasons should be interesting for us lets not forget that these are more sports cars than sports sedans hopefully ill be in the minivan by then toting kids around id love to have a 1986 caravan and a gtr for myself and the m5 or a tuaras for the finacee sorry riez but the is300 is the only lexus that actually looks and feels like a regular toyota after sitting in the interior for five minutes one thing came to mind corolla i am sure it handles great and all that but the interior imo the interior is major turnoff ok maybe i am spoiled but after driving an audi for almost a year ive become what you call a dashstroker i sat in the audi my not quite father in law just bought and all i could think was volkswagen which by the way is not bad considering the passat interior is one of the most refined even out of its own class while the interior was nicer in the audi it made me bored g may not have the warm simple perfection of the audibut its not boring at all perhaps i enjoy chaos speedracer put on over 30000 miles in an 00 323ia wprem pkg and nearly 30000 miles in my loaded 98 540i6 the is300 interior compares favorably but then again im not looking for fake wood trim warm brown interiors etc i want only black interior and prefer aluminumchrome trim piece interiors the is300 has beautiful drilled pedals and the interesting chronograph instrument cluster the is300 has one more legitimate gauge than either the 323ia or 540i6 the is300 is a boy racer interior serious interior for serious fun what more could you want out of an interior luxury not me my wife was always mad about the 323ia it lacked the chrome doorsill plate like the 540i6 the 3 series is just decent interior wise bmw interiors certainly have the material quality you would expect out of a luxury car but the styling itself is austere imo a bit boring the g35 is fine ergonomically but the quality of some of the plastics is poor for a luxury car the is300 has a boy racer look that not everybody cares for some of the materials are toyota not lexus quality and i dont care for that chronograph speedo and such audi interiors are not always ergonomically sound putting a cupholder over the stereo comes to mind but the quality of plastics is incredible also there is so much attention to detail and style that it is a pleasure to sit inside day in and day out riez  im glad you enjoy your is300 so much but youve got to come clean how did you justify owning a car in this class range that gets suv type fuel mileage 1825 were you aware of this fact when you bought the car are the numerous trips to the gas station worth the driving fun do any of you out there consider fuel economy when buying a luxury performance sedan i know i do do any of you out there consider fuel economy when buying a luxury performance sedan i know i do yes my vehicle gets 32 mpg on the open road even tooling along at a good rate i usually get 2426 in city driving cr validates the 32 which i find amazing gas mileage is important for a daily driver it wouldnt be as important for a weekend car do any of you out there consider fuel economy when buying a luxury performance sedan i know i do  yes as long as its better than 1416 im ok i may get a prius next time and the gf an m5  then ill be in the right car to worry about mileage from an expense standpoint gas has been a lower and lower percentage of my driving costs considering my car is fully financed and insurance is higher than 1k i may get a prius next time and the gf an m5 not me m5 for me gf gets ferrari wife gets rx330 i may get a prius next time and the gf an m5\\nnot me m5 for me gf gets ferrari wife gets rx330  with all the sitting our cars do we decided to cut back she was going to get a 3 series or a murano or fx while i have the g  we both will be taking train soon to work so whats the pointwe need one nice car and one beater she got a mitsubishi outlander can you believe i talked princess into that for the simple fact we need awd and want only one lux car sitting at the train station so next time its my turn to get a beater the prius may be the ultimate car for what we need 12 the time i bet i could coast her down the hill to the station without even turning the motor on my dads is impressive i promised her a 5 to get this deal i may end up in a le car if they are more than the 80k i expect them to be lol looks like you came to your financial senses for a while i thought you had more cars than schwarzenneger but on the other hand i can afford an m5 the question is can i afford the insurance thanks riez for the cr info on the g35 the g35 in that test is also lacking the sport package with the nicer tires and tighter suspension as for fuel economy despite technological advancement performance and economy are fundamentally opposite objectives and gas is cheap compared to the total cost of this class of cars as an owner of none of these but a long time shopper my opinion on the best for each function exterior design all good all different\\ninterior design a4 tl cclass\\nsizespace g35 and tl\\nacceleration bmw g35 tl\\nbraking all very similar\\nhandling bmw g35 is300\\ncost similar except the 330i cclass cost more\\nreliability japanese better than european for me personally acceleration handling size and cost are more important than the interior so if i were shopping for a sedan it would lead me to the g35 but i am looking for a convertible and i cant have a manual because my significant other will not budge on that issue all that leads me to a 330cic with smg have fun and remember they are all nice cars depending largely on what you want most how can the tl with its 270 hp engine be placed behind a 225 hp bmw in acceleration ive driven both cars the acceleration on the tl is phenomenal because the 330i is actually faster to 60 according to car and driver because the 330i is actually faster to 60 according to car and driver if thats true it doesnt accord with my real world experience also the vtec engines are well known for not having a lot of low end torque if the 330i and tl are both going say 40 im sure the tl would hit 70 a lot faster you can check car and driver yourself i dont have the links handy this information is actually posted up a few kdshapiro i believe your stats on car and driver i could see a 330i beating a tl on a flat start but not with a running start also wondering if they compared manual to manual or manual to automatic but on the other hand i can afford an m5 the question is can i afford the insurance  we should be closer to middle aged and perhaps on the matrimony discount by then hoping for anti lawsuit legislation as wellid also consider the jet bike jay leno bought if the m doesnt work out as he describes itfaster you go  the more it accelerates that would be quite a feat if they can get a car to do thatwas contemplating a rolls royce turbine upgrade on the g instead of a lightweight flywheel ha this is the one to watch in about a years time frame ill bet the farm it goes awd with the sooped up engine httpwwwimakenewscomautospiese_article000214337cfm chrisboth  kahunah what percentage of longterm ownership costs do you think are related to fuel not much depreciation is the biggest hit dont forget about insurance ttl annual registration maintenance including tires i paid about 30000 for the car im getting about 2526 mpg if i drive 100000 miles over 6 years that will take about 3922 gallons of fuel at 255 avgmpg in my town right now premium amocobp ultimate the only fuel i use costs about 163 per gallon that would be a mere 6393 in total fuel costs my car insurance over the same time would be about 7200 the intitial tax on the car was around 1500 in the first five years of ownership it will cost me about 1950 just to register the car 325 per year four sets of tires will cost me at least 1600 at just 100 per tire and what will depreciation be over this 100k6 years probably about 2024000 so that 6393 in fuel isnt a big consideration say i got 30 mpg that would be 3333 gallons for 5433 or a mere 960 160 per year or just 0096 per mile driven is this a big deal not even a penny a mile hope i did my maths right im getting nearly 26 mpg that is suvlike not hardly at least not at 74 mph which is what i normally drive on interstate i enjoy putting food in my baby its the insurance that makes me spin im paying for a hit  run rings dinner right now via my insurance premiunm and i bet they are eating better than i right now you tell me riez rx330 2026 fwd\\nrx330 1824 awd\\nis300 1825 rwd thats just pitiful all figures courtesy of lexuscom the rx isnt an suv its a tall camry station wagon with a lot of gadgets but the is is not particularly fuel efficient fgiven its size and output but i expect that the new v6 engines in the upcoming gs and probably the next is if there is one will get betteg mpg as reiz pointed out if you can afford a car in this class and its upkeep the difference between 25 and 30 mpg isnt going to be a real big factor as reiz pointed out if you can afford a car in this class and its upkeep the difference between 25 and 30 mpg isnt going to be a real big factor honestly though these cars are in the range for other vehicles their size engine size and weight but wouldnt you rather get 23 around town than 17 unless you buy a v12 forced air high performance whatever in the 3 to 35l range there is no reason good performance has to come at the expense of fuel economy and emissions what with the evo cited in enthusiast mags about getting 14mpg if thats your bag fine right now it aint mine i dont think that fuel millage is very important when buying a car\\nbut on the other hand for 30 engine and only 220hp sound like realy low millage plus the car is not that heavy have anybody here considered s60r not many people talking about it but looks like a grate car i dont think that fuel millage is very important when buying a car when youre fuel bills are 350 dollars a month because you drive a lot of mileage and get lousy economy you might change your mind but of course we each have our own priorities i drove a v8 pickup for a few years to condition myself before buying a sporty sedan anything that gets over 20 mpg is an economy car to me i seldom even check the mileage any more one of the beauties of not having a trip computer is you dont have to deal with as much guilt just gas and go well first of all horsepower has little to do with acceleration its all about top speed acceleration is about torque and not just peak torque but the whole area under the torque curve the tl achieves 238 lbft  5000 rpm while the bmw achieves 214 lbft  3500 rpm so there is only 24 lb ft of difference in the peak torque but the bmw acheives it much earlier an earlier torque peak generally means a much broader and flatter torque curve in general less peaky it also generally means less peak hp which explains the large hp difference and second of all the engine is not alone power is tramsitted to the ground via the gearing of the transmission and the final drive axle gear spacing affects acceleration by allowing the engine to stay longer between its peak torque and peak hp the first gear ratio also needs to be selected so as to deliver maximum power without overpowering the wheels and tires that will deliver the force to the ground all that being said i listed the bmw g35 and tl because they are approximately equal in all the acceleration testing i have seen there seems to be just as large a variation in the times of different g35s for instance as there is a variation between the three different models the rx is based on the camry the is300s lowish highway fuel economy estimate is due to its gearing it does not use a very deep overdrive 5th gear id prefer a deeper overdrive but you hardly have to shift out of 5th in order to pass the is300 is performance car not an economy car designed for drivers who even want performance in 5th gear just compare the gearing in the camry and rx versus the is300 taking into account both final drive ratio and the individual ratio of each gear if you want to complain check out the mileage differences between the 325i and 330i the less powerful 325i isnt very fuel efficient and part of that problem is tied to its gearing as well as a smallish engine for the cars weight unless you buy a v12 forced air high performance whatever in the 3 to 35l range there is no reason good performance has to come at the expense of fuel economy and emissions what with the evo cited in enthusiast mags about getting 14mpg if thats your bag fine right now it aint mine whats that song on the pulp fiction sountrack about a preacher man its in my head right now for some reasonwhatever kds drives is the right amount of gas mileage to be getting to not be over polluting with emissions and about the right gas mileagesick the prius board on him if mileage is a concern you will always compromise yourself out of the next class up wont you 300400 hp 45k cars babyfuggeda about the flippin gas  we live in the us people well i cant believe i got thru the thread i have to say i used to have an is300 and it was ok i used it as a daily beater for me it was a good commuter car certainly not comfortable for long rides and not quick enough to toy with people stoplight to stoplight it handled well but no better than the a4 i had i bought it used for a great price and i must say it was damn reliable but above all this the reason i got rid of it was because of the type of people that drive them most not all are juveniles or act like it and swear up and down its the best vehicle since the model t was introduced at least now ive dumped it and i dont have these clowns coming up to me asking me what mods it has  the truth is revealed thanks g17 there is one other sportcross and 3 is300 sedans that regularly cut through my neighborhood i have never seen anyone under 30 driving one of them i am 51 and i kind of like the way the younger women react to my is300 sportcross the trouble is they are more interested in the car than me i even have some mods to talk about if one of them asks it is kind of sad to get so mature that you worry about being associated with juveniles i think i will try and avoid that condition as long as possible so we are to worry about who else might like and drive the same car bmw owners are always tarnished as snobs or yuppies mb owners as aloof intelligensia\\nvolvos and saabs as suburban soccer moms or savethewhale crowd japanese premium marques as boring and playing it safe jaguar as being tothemanorborn this must rule out most porsche and corvette owners who obsess about performance and improving their cars performance not to mention all the mustang firebird camaro etc people who love to do mods not to mention the entire tuner crowd and their civics etc but then again when i used to have my 96 impala ss and was a member of the major owner clubs state and nationally when we got together all we talked about were mods performance tuning etc and we were the 3050 crowd guess people are more alike than not people who love cars love performance and want the best that might mean some mods and yeah trd and others have some nice mods for the is300 that is a problem for anyone here it will always be the samehow fast do you want to go  how much money have you got  riez i agree with you 100 you cant even judge someones wealth by the cars they drive i know plenty of wealthy people who treat cars like a cost lets face it its probably the most rapidly depreciating asset you can own and will gladly buy a camcord beat on it for 7 years and then buy another one others dont have much but put all their cash into cars and skimp on everything else or they buy a used car for cheap you can never tell others dont have much but put all their cash into cars and skimp on everything else or they buy a used car for cheap you can never tell and others have a lot and they have fleets of high price over 100k automobiles so in essence we have 1 people with little acquiring inexpensive automobiles\\n2 people with little acquiring expensive automobiles\\n3 people with wherewithall acquiring inexpensive autmobiles\\n4 people with wherewithall acquiring expensive automobiles which makes you feel better what a rhetorical question of course its always better to be young rich and healthy than old poor and sick\\neverything else comes in between and depends on priorities abilities and circumstances what a rhetorical question of course its always better to be young rich and healthy than old poor and sick correct and id rather be old poor and sick than dead im hoping to be old rich healthy driving an m6 and ummm errr how can i say this ummm in the mood  best regards\\nshipo dont you think people see their car as projecting their lot in life or is there a disconnect for most people philosophy of consumerism i dont know about thatwe just all want the biggest  and want to brag we have it imo the people who have biggest baddest cars  way more than we are paying for entry lux sedans  are the ones who if they hadnt spent all the  would be millionares and look like they are while the ones who drive an accord may just be millionaires as they have been prudent but seem to be the avg joe the wealthiest people i know act like they are poor and drive vws and vans the best looking cars i can point to in any friends garage well that guy is buying gas on his credit card so he can afford the payment and some in my fam think im an asss for buying a 35k carto them i say  its 3k more than the loaded passat i thought was prudentand i get 10 times that in value from the pleasure it gives me to drive itmost of us on a board like this probably actually are nuts about cars way more than we are paying for entry lux sedans  are the ones who if they hadnt spent all the  would be millionares  not truei waited long time before i got my car and i could have afforded one back in the day due to smart investing the wealthiest people i know act like they are poor and drive vws and vans some of the ones i know drive rollsto each their own one friend of mine owns 11 car dealerships and one bank he is very wealthy and drives a 1999 chevy s10 pickup truck another friend of mine cant rub two nickels together and at the time of purchase he was unemployed he has a 2001 bmw m3 i actually did a research project on this same topic for a psychology class with test subjects between the ages of 18 and 50 and the only hard conclusions i could come too was that the younger drivers made their purchases based on the status that particular name brand brought them and the older drives were more apt to makes their purchases based upon performance and driveability personaly i want looks performance handeling and every possible toy inside for a reasonable price which is why i purchased my 04 tl with nav it can go either way  it goes all different ways all of the time i wanted a bmw for the longest time and finally got one there is no turning back and no substitute it may be not be the most luxorious or fastest but what it does it does best and thats what i love about it i too thought i wanted a bmw but bounced on the price and lack of lsd in the 330 i could have easily dealt with the price but i couldnt forgive bmw for leaving out the lsd so it was pretty easy to buy the is300 where things like hids premium sound and metallic paint are standard equipment the lsd was a 330 option quite a bargain dont you think people see their car as projecting their lot in life or is there a disconnect for most people philosophy of consumerism i hate what my bmw represents to too many people i drive an 03 pro most often and only use the bimmer on the weekends even then ive had many people ask me if the 330i is my car as im loading things into it and such guess my usual weekend dishevled appearance doesnt jive with the concept of a bimmer owner shirt with holes unshaven barely brushed hair and frayedworn shortsjeans fits my usual weekend look btw someone mentioned paying cash for gas thats just silly credit cards give you cash back and or rewards for using them using the card is free the expenses will be incurred anyway so why not get something for your expenditures i use cash as little as possible because the return on cash is nothing but the product lastly id agree with kd ive wanted a bimmer since 98 when the current bodysetup hit the streets i drove everything and ended up with the car that i think fits me perfectly nothing quite like loving your car i hate what my bmw represents to too many people lets extend that concept i hate what rolls is to many people i hate what ferrari is to many people i hate what maybach is to many people i hate what mercedes is to many peopleoh well i could go on like it or not its a diverse world thank the lord the amount of money any one person has does not affect the handling of any one car that is what we are really discussing here right one car vs another not one car buyers money vs another car buyers money or one car buyers snobbishness vs another car buyers snobbishness it makes you feel really good to say due to jealously imho theres a person worth a fortune driving a 10 year old hyundai some people flaunt it some dont either way its theirs to do with as they want and ill do with mine what i want buy the car i want for my own reasons kd you are right as always different strokes for different folks and different people buy and drive different cars for different reasons just as some guys prefer blondes but others prefer brunettes but you got to get rid of your 10 year old hyundai example because that is a cheap unreliable unsafe pos which imho is not preferred by anyone except for those who cannot afford something better  kdyou got to get rid of your 10 year old hyundai example because that is a cheap unreliable unsafe pos which imho is not preferred by anyone except for those who cannot afford something better now thats what im saying thank youuu kennyg5  147if you are intensely aware of the difference between what is simply good and what is genuinely excellent if you love to drive yet are constrained to run a four or fiveseat vehiclethen bmw 3series cars are the perfect answer148 bmws bestselling offering the 3 series is available in coupe convertible sedan and sports wagon versions the above quote was from a press release from bmw featuring a quote from automobile magazine as the 3series racked up another allstar award for the 12th year in a row wanna see some g35 press releases are we supposed to be impressed by bmws marketing people if theres any doubt who the new leader is read some independent press are we supposed to be impressed by bmws marketing people this quote did not come from bmw marketing this quote was taken from the feb 2004 issue of automobile bmw marketing was just quoting this snippet from the article in their press release press releases are marketing ever seen a press release by an automobile manufacturer talking about how another car is better  acura could use the cr article in its press release and infiniti could use an article talking about the g35 take them for what they are worth they are worth the writers or the editors opinion what really matters is are they selling the car acura is apparently selling the tl better than any of their previous tls even without an endorsement from automobile magazine\\ni would pay to see five people in a 3 seriesit must look like one of those circus cars where all of the clowns get out of a very small car i would pay to see five people in a 3 seriesit must look like one of those circus cars where all of the clowns get out of a very small car hmmm i dont know about that i had five adults in my former 3series any number of times im not going to lie to you and say that they had all the room in the world however they claimed to be comfortable enough best regards\\nshipo what really matters is are they selling the car isnt that the point it doesnt matter for example why people dont understand why bmw sells boat loads of their 3series just that they do however in the pursuit of automotive excellence the press provides a function in determining in a more unbiased fashion than you or i debating the merits of a particular vehicle or aspect of a vehicle the reason i posted that information is to show in contrary to some other opinions that the 3series is a hasbeen the automotive press still regards it as a benchmark in the world of entry level luxury sport sedans this is not in one magazines opinions but others as well looking at automotive opinions is just one way of level setting the conversation now you could go say you dont believe that vehicle is for you or that it doesnt have any value to you or other vehicles do some aspects in the world of sports sedans better i would more than agree but you cant discuss sports or sporty sedans while ignoring the obvious which is the overall handling and not focus on one set of numbers pretty much anytime the automotive press rightly touts the 3 series they normally are talking about either the m3 a most awesome car or nonm cars with 1 manual transmission and 2 sport package a 325i automatic without sport pkg is a rather expensive and somewhat mundane car there is really nothing unique about it other than the marque badging but it lacks those critical features 1 and 2 that create the difference between what is simply good and what is genuinely excellent if you love to drive there is only one way to get a 3 series sport package and manual transmission all the others are pretenders as serious all around sport sedans and if bmw was so serious about the love of driving and creating the true existential difference between good and excellent where is lsd that speaks volumes only m3 and m5 have lsd does bmw think the other buyers arent smart enough to figure it out or do they know something about their buyers that we dont but guess what percentage of 3 series esp sedans are sold with automatics bet it is at least 60 percent and what percentage of 3 series sedans have sport package doubt it is over 25 percent and what percentage of sedans are both manual transmission and sport package doubt it is over 15 percent so the vast majority of 3 series sedan owners must be willing to settle for a heck of a lot less than they could have purchased and could be driving kdshapiro forget what your 3 series is automatic sport pkg if you love to drive there is only one way to get a 3 series sport package and manual transmission all the others are pretenders as serious all around sport sedans sorry riez gotta agreedisagree on this one at the same time practicality rears it ugly head here and i wouldnt drive a manual sitting in the traffic i sit in every morning i do not have the luxury of an m3 as a weekend car at this point so my nonmanual nonsport equipped vehicle will have to do if that makes me a pretender so be it if it makes chrisboth a pretender also so be it if the vehicle doesnt have lsd makes it a pretender so be it even if i purchased a less expensive vehicle an auto tranny would be sure to follow except when i can get that m3 as a nonsnow nontraffic weekend car is a very good driving machine but not a decent riding machine its small in rear and hard on all seats the again most pure sports cars are not very comfortable tl may not be as good a driving machine but is more practical than b3 as a sedan if you are not the only one in the car all the time kdshapiro you are kidding right you bring up the existential difference between good and excellent and then say practicality rears it ugly head heresitting in the traffic i sit in every morning that may mean you have to have an automatic nonsport pkg but that does not mean that said car is excellent it is good but it cant hold a candle to a manual sport pkg 330i just compare the tires and have you ever looked at the base tires on a 325i nonsport garbage while a great philosopher said hell is other people he might have said hell is being stuck in traffic no car stuck in traffic is doing what it is meant to do provide driving pleasure it is then just a mere vehicle if you sit a lot in traffic buy 2 vehicles get yourself a honda civic 4cyl for traffic and a honda s2000 or mazda miata for fun might cost you as much as a loaded 330i the thing is i would rather forgo the sit in civic mentality with an excellent weekend car than have a nicely equipped allaround model i just had a ride in a civic no thanks ill keep mine its one of those little compromises one makes in life the m3 is the ultimate gt and we all know it yet 63k is a little high for me for a car that cannot be a daily beater the great thing about bmw is that they recognize the purchaser might want to make compromises like i did and provide options for every occasion the m3 costs as much as a loaded 530i seems worth it you want a 63 near supercar and you drive a 330i automatic nonsport makes no sense to me but i cant explain people they pass up the excellent for the good i couldnt imagine spending 40k on any vehicle let alone one that spent a lot of time stuck in traffic i might either move or buy another car but then my work commuter car is a fwd hyundai sonata gls v6 5speed manual loaded with leather sunroof etc and i paid about 18000 for it you want a 63 near supercar and you drive a 330i automatic nonsport makes no sense to me i thought my car was a perfect daily commuter lets say the middle of the road between a civic and m3 whats wrong with that had the zhp been available at the time i probably would have gotten that all the others are pretenders as serious all around sport sedans re 3 over a g i hope feeling not pretending is consolation for being left behind in performanceeven the zhp handles almost exactly the same as a sports sedan g and the g is faster in quarter mile and to 100 the only real truth anywhere around here should be gleaned from actual comparisons the fm platform has been recently compared to the gt3 porscheand often compared to the 5 serieswho really is worried if the everyman 3 driving public gives credence to the car that actually performs better than the 3 the 5 the boxster the audi a4 and a6 the mercedes 320 in any model and i used to commute 90 miles a day in my zhp i snatched up an 03 protege es manual for that duty now every weekday i miss my zhp but for practicalitys sake i couldnt see putting 2530k miles on the bimmer every year of course all my cars are manuals and i dont it a lick in traffic ill take the tired left leg over being in a car that doesnt keep me involved  ie automatics someone mentioned 5 adults in a 3 done it many many times but these arent cornfed midwestern or bundled up northeasterners the size of the adults makes a difference two petite females and an average adult male fit back there just fine 32l m3 nissan 36l v6 accord 30 v6 are among the 10 best engines but the dominant v6 benchmark is nissan 35l v6 not the way i read it nissans vq series is one of the best v6 engines you can buy bmws i6 is the one of the best inline 6 engines you can buy i read it this way those 10 engines are the ten top engines you can buy from frugal to gashog look you cant have everything in every engine  some enjoy power and some enjoy ecofriendly ill take the power esentially kds will say the vq isnt as good since it uses more gas or isnt as smooth or whatever will get you to forget that simply is the faster motor with more powerif you want to buy an economy car many cars in this class will let you down  get the ever mentioned hynduia id guess if you spent 10k more for a car than the rest of the class youd need to save for gas esentially kds will say the vq isnt as good since it uses more gas or isnt as smooth or whatever will get you to forget that simply is the faster motor with more power i wont say anything except like the i6 its on the 10 best list sounds like bmw envy tl or g35 envy chris believe me bmw m3 does have one of the best engine so does accord 30l v6 it is the 10 best car engine but your friend forgot to read but the dominant v6 benchmark is nissan 35l v6 no need to bring in a lot of different engines for comparison either power torque brakespecific fuel consumption just about any attribute youre looking at the nissans at the top of the list148 the m3 has a fantastic engine  but not for reliablity  they lose like 1 of them as the stroke is too long for a 9000 rpm car great motor but you can see the issues it brings also lets keep in mind that the vq in the g is detuned  theres another 1040 hp or so more in there depending on which platform gets it that m or a 330 is pushing its hp limit already it seems that when you have a near in front of the car category and the price tag trying to stay below 40k you either get more l or more p but not both all out at the same time arguably b3 is the best in terms of performance but also most expensive to cover the badge and rwd but therere people who are willing to trade a bit less performancerwd handling for a bit more luxury the interior settings conveniences amenities and roomcomfort other than es in that price range which is simply a luxury no p sedan it seems that the new tl wins on that l department agreed but therere people who are willing to trade a bit less performancerwd handling for a bit more luxury the interior settings conveniences amenities and room i would think that is a fair statment had to do an emergency business trip today 120 miles on state 2lane roads 10 12 inches of snow fell in past 18 hours snowed all time i was driving temps around 15 deg f with below 0 deg f wind chill blowing hard at times got there and back with no problems my 04 is300 5speed manual had no trouble having manual transmission snowmode throttle lsd abs and tc does help but just driving prudently for the conditions is key dont think i ever went faster than 50 mph and likely averaged only about 40 mph saw a new nissan maxima fwd and an older dodge stratus fwd in ditch along with an older chevy camaro rwd and a business chevy fullsize utility van rwd when i drove back a fwd chrysler 300m followed behind me theres another 1040 hp or so more in there depending on which platform gets it that m or a 330 is pushing its hp limit already im a fan of nissan but im not impressed by the size of the vq v the power output over 115 hp per liter without a turbo or supercharger is impressive engineering anything else and the m3 csl puts out over 350 hp then again some of the hybrids displayed will do even better well get torque thats instantaneous and better mileage yummy 600 lbft of torque instantly and 35 mpg thats what i call heaven the vq is no 32 from bavaria agreed the vq is amazing becasue of the torque at low rpm  not that low but the s for the current m3 and g coupe for torque output are roughly the same the cars would both take off and hang together id imagine until the m hit 6 to 65 1000 rpm then the extra 2030 k starts to make sense maybe but the rest of us who buy a japanese or otherwise affordable car are lucky to have the vq 115 perlitre is a beaut and the vtec is another great engine when looking at that metric of performance g35 is a good car but lets not carried away and compare it to m3 m3 is better in every way including engine trany and suspension tl has 270hp 32 that is 843 hp per litter and g35 260hp 35 is about 743 hp per litter i drove g35 and it feels like the engine is dying after 4000 rpm that is not what you want if you want to experience performance of a rwd at high speed on the other hand tl 32 comes alive after about 3500 rpm to me it makes all the difference if honda would make the tl a rwd car id all but guarantee itd replace my bmw in 2006 a butter sweet 6 speed manual with that nice 6 and honda quality i dont even think id pause when leaving the bmw at the lease return and i do love my car i just dont think my bmw is a well made car ive been reading this thread for a while and im curious to know your reasons as to why you say the g35 has just run over the 3series the way ive seen it written over and over is that the g35 is the best alternative to the 3series but still hasnt matched or beaten the 3series in everything the bmw is still more than being merely competitive even with less power are you saying the 3 is no longer the benchmark and that mb audi jaguar and others are studying the g35 now despite my fascination with german cars the g35 coupe is a strong contender for my next car but the interior is downright cheap for this class of car whether or not its trying to be different is open for debate but that still doesnt mean it has to be cheap feelinglooking the reason i bring this up is because im reading your posts and they read like the 3series isnt even any competition for the g35 thats hardly the case m i drove g35 and it feels like the engine is dying after 4000 rpm that is not what you want if you want to experience performance of a rwd at high speed the tourque peak is at around 4  did you actually drive it the end of the fun is around 6k if you look at the curve and actually drive one its quite apparent lets not forget the tl v g 14 mile and 0100 numbers at 4 grand with wot the g is as fast as an m3 until 6k this does not make it a better car than an m3 the bang for buck is exactly where you say it isnt in the g when you go for another drive notice it has almost a turbo lag until about 3200 rmp  and then thrust city your statement is quite absurd imo at 4k the thing is worth bmw money and i may have paid it tl has 270hp 32 that is 843 hp per litter and g35 260hp 35 is about 743 hp per litter i drove g35 and it feels like the engine is dying after 4000 rpm that is not what you want if you want to experience performance of a rwd at high speed on the other hand tl 32 comes alive after about 3500 rpm to me it makes all the difference  take a look at torque numbers per litre for each while you are waiting to come alive ive been thrusting down the pike and showing you my leds are you saying the 3 is no longer the benchmark and that mb audi jaguar and others are studying the g35 now i doubt the germans will ever emulate the japanese  too bad for many reasons too but i am saying the g35 is teh benchmark now look at the new gs lexus shows at the detriot show i believe for 2006 looks like the g has had an impact for the next generation in design did you see the rear quarter  they may get sued look at the numbers look at the design and the reliablity hell if you dont like the interior as much as i love my willow leather and titanium then wait 12 months and see what happens the benchmark should not lose to a first timer in performance be smaller and cost more while in the same class and be considered anything but playing catch up ala the 38i v8 3 series coming soon with a g competitive price too is there that much of a difference in g over three  no no no its simply my argument that that 3 being a benchmark is yesterdays hype still rolling with powerful marketing intertia the 3 is great no g owner want to take that away from anyoneits just not the only one anymore and not the best by the performance numbers if there is something else besides great numbers and looks to pay for im not sure im going to pay bmw prices for it i think some people just like that germanic intangible  you get it in a golf too and to me it conjures up reliabillity issues that seem to pervade every german automaker relentelessly and consistenly see bllueguys comments as a 3 owner also the benchmark should not be overlooked by a comepitors cross shopping as the 3 is when g cross shopppers look at the 5 as an alternative id say the 5 is the benchmark the g strives to become over the next five years and the 3 becomes more inline with the is300 and accord and saab is it pricing or size that matters when class comparing audi and jag could stand to learn from someone the audi4 is a passat

comparison test i apologize for the formatting but it was a copy and paste\\nmy point here is that sometimes we get overly enthusiastic about what we own and start quoting what we believe to be true in terms of performance etc all of these are fine cars and we all have different reasons for buying them\\nthese are 2003 models the tl stats have improved for the tl because of the new model i believe the 330i and the g35 are consistent with the 2004 models as they are running the same motors as 2003 in 2004 \\nthe recent edmunds test for the 04 tl had 060 in 65 and 14 mile in 149 g35 for 2004 was 060 in 61 and 14 mile in 147 i know the 330i 060 was almost identical to the tl there were some 57 times reported for both in recent articles\\nthe 2003 comparison showed the 330i with the fastest 060 time of 63 you can find different reviews of these cars with different 060 and 14 mile times i believe this is explained by track conditions tires and skill of the individuals doing the driving the bottom line for me is that i think you can throw a blanket over these cars in terms of performance in a straight line it will depend on who is at the wheel i guess i am disputing the post above which states everyone else will be seeing the leds of the g 35\\na really interesting part of the test which i had not seen before was the run through the 600 ft slalom course the 330i won by edging out the a4 and both of these were 2 mph faster than the others the g35 was last i dont know if the g35 made changes to suspension or tires for 04\\ni just re read the edmunds test for the 04 tl and the tl went through at 67 mph this year quite an improvement from the 03 tls 613 mph edmunds said it was one of the fastest cars weve ever taken through the cones as a tl owner it shows me that perhaps the rhetoric i constantly hear about rwd being much better handling isnt necessarily true in all instances\\ni am looking forward to the shoot out articles that are surely coming in the auto mags at least it frames the conversations in facts and data and away from opinion raher  just to cite an example cars improve every year so it would be no surprise a fwd of 1980 would be bested by a fwd of 2004 however having said that i would like to see how the new zhp stacks up with the g35 with the sp against the new tl in the same comparo chances are they will best the fwd because of the weight distribution it is my belief that the average driver can get more out of a fwd than a rwd but a rwd driver who has taken performance classes can extract more out of the rwd than a skilled driver can extract out of the fwd so to your point there are advantages and disadvantages of each that test did not do justice to the type s\\nemunds compared apples to oranges the type s was an automatic while the bimmer and the g were rowing their gears manually if all the cars were automatic across the board the tl would have won hands down i am only standing up for the car i own not trying to make any point justice served i drove g35 and it feels like the engine is dying after 4000 rpm that is not what you want if you want to experience performance of a rwd at high speed on the other hand tl 32 comes alive after about 3500 rpm to me it makes all the difference the converse of this would be that the g35 comes alive as soon as you press the gas while the tl feels dead until 3500 rpm not that i truly agree about either car feeling dead it is my belief that the average driver can get more out of a fwd than a rwd but a rwd driver who has taken performance classes can extract more out of the rwd than a skilled driver can extract out of the fwd results of grand prix championships would tend to disagree with you 3series and integras were always fighting for top honors i actually agree with you in the light hp duty class that is one of the advantages of fwd but the horsepower race is on 400 hp to front wheel not sure about that no problem with rwd but we are talking near luxury not gp in the world of near luxury street legal cars its a different story so yes cars like the mini will shine in certain situations due to its overall small chassis which is aided by the fact fwd has a smaller footprint but they are inhertently hp limited in terms of the topic i stand by my assertion talking near luxury sporty sedans the bottom line for me is that i think you can throw a blanket over these cars in terms of performance in a straight line  in 99 of every comparison i have ever read apples to apples the 0100 and the quarter mile went to the g  that says alot 060 can go to anyone on any given day but the real fun and where my purchase decision was made is winding out 3rdthat is well past 60 mph and where my engine and platform shine and seemingly pull away from all competition ive seen it on the street and ive seen it in the mags the g pulls hard and leaves many in awe in 3rd gear i have 5at as a tl owner it shows me that perhaps the rhetoric i constantly hear about rwd being much better handling isnt necessarily true in all instances no not in all instances but many still 67 is great for a fwder but since you quote edmunds above here are some other quotes  kds will enjoy thisfor me if im after a truly sporty sedan i have to go with the bmw 3 series that is from the editor in cheef after testing the new tl since fwd is for many more than rwd this car should be fine for those folks  there are some more discerning sprts sedan drivers who will avoid this myself included driving dynamics are a serious issue in my book and only rwd covers all the performance bases fwd is too compromising and the reason in the article are stated up front they are physical laws that cannot be avoided even by japansese engineers at honda there were other comments on edmunds that the tl is great as long as you dont drive an accord first and get a taste of the platform with about the right amount of power and all the great reason to buy an acura but for alot less and again why should the g without sp upgrades be compared to 3 with upgrades i still will take my chances in 5at form against one on track and god knows i would in 6mt form lets see the g35 with a performance package and then well compare again someone mentioned the g was shooting for the starsdam right and getting there quickly  this is year 2 folks and 5 series has been here for how long keep in mind that at 3900 pounds the and similarly sized as g the g is much faster and equally as fast as the 540i but wait the g doesnt have that intangible no one can explain that only the 5 supposedly hasgremlins oh and much more dough and the propeller thingy the main point of my post was to emphasize that enthusiasm for the cars we own often clouds reality and opinion is stated as fact edmunds didnt say their slalom test result for the tl was good for a fwd carthey said it was one of the fastest they had ever tested period as to race track performance one of the previous posts said it best3 series and integra battle it out for championships in scca racing in that class your opinion of the g35 is no substitute for facts stating that in 99 of the tests you have seen the g35 wins 060 and 0100 doesnt mean anything unless you have an example\\nwhat tests  where i am sure the g35 has come out on top in some tests just as the 330i has and the tl i stand by my original statementyou can throw a blanket over them for straight line performance the differences are in 110s of a second having gearing that emphasizes torque or speed in 3rd versus 2nd or 4th doesnt matter if you are measuring 060 or 0100 since elapsed time is what is being measured\\ngearing is more important on a race track since the car has to be set up to maximize speed within the confines of the circuit having a 160 mph top speed doesnt get you much if the straight only allows 140 mph top end\\ni know the g35 is a great car i would have bought the coupe but my wife couldnt live with two doors that doesnt mean it is the end all 30k to 40k sedan however as you keep insisting in your posts chris  my take is that you would be very eager to own an evo this is the car with uncompromising performance quoted from car and driver magazine in a preview test of the new tl estimated a 060 time of six seconds flat\\n060 600 secs cd\\n14 mile accelaration 1488 secs1008mph car engine\\nchris is right 060 can go to anyone at anygiven days but 0100 i havent seen a lot of them just 2 article tl04 will start opening those electric spool valve starting on 4700 rpm that translates into a broader torque curve and significant peak powerquoted from carguide magazine since this tl is new some data is not available and many hasnt tested it yet lets wait i cant even test it my self too much snow out there cant wait but i dont want to make it muddy yet some article said new tl tuned with aspec will get 300 hp is it true i would love to own an evo  10 years ago if the evo was comparable it would make sense to bring it up if we are on this board can we not assume that everyone wants a performance entry lux sedan you are suggesting that performance is very imprtant you are right which is why in class i picked the g i am not in the market for a very well placed and put together econo box im in my 30s and dont want another car in the driveway performance looks value size tortional rigidity price and class without tude and service are my bullets for purchase this is why i turned down a great deal on an a6  everything was there but performance  oh and the look was getting old and that actually made me not even negotiate further are you insane the g has nothing on the 540 i am no bimmer fan but that 540 is one monster of a car the g cant even get past the 330 weight or no weight the 540 is a supreme car to the g weight or no weight the 540 is a supreme car to the g its not 540 at this point its 545 quoting hpl figure is completely misleading in our situation you have to quote the actual hp as realized by the drive wheels there are tons of efficiency losses some marques and models are better than others real interesting figures are drivewheel hpl drivewheel hplb the entire output curve based on drivewheel results tire efficiency gearing and cd would be interesting to compare these too bad manufacturers dont ever quote drivewheel hp anyone got a dyno i have to agree with billyperks about 540545 but i dont agree g cant even past 330 but thats only from people that i know some cars are faster than others eventhou they are the same typemodel car just like my friends rsx02 with modified exhaust  intake etc vs mustang gt but at top speed the rsult is different which hardly can be achieved in street drivings the results are 2 tickets from iowa states police mustang won how many passenger you have also make a difference during the test i am no bimmer fan but that 540 is one monster of a car the g cant even get past the 330 the 540 is great lets agree on that but as far as actual performance you need to realize what the g can doand this is outperform a 540 until about 100mph  ive been there and many others have as well as far as the 330 comment you must not have read back very far  even the 330 owners concede much performance and hang thier hat on the intangible bmw is the best driving machine stuff while they admit things like yeah the g is faster so go get an evo if you want fast 330ipuleeeeze  i think the rsx is faster than the auto 330 id rather a 325 which is a good value if you want the car and not all the performance  almost what the 330i offers in context of the lastest competition for infinit and acura hey everybody upgrades thier motors when someone in a class behind can keep up its ahp war and everyone can add displacement  i thought that went against your values kd  where they just add litres instead of something intangible lets not forget they are not comparable and the price of a 545 is near 70kand we are still comparing stating that in 99 of the tests you have seen the g35 wins 060 and 0100 doesnt mean anything unless you have an example example of what you are suggesting the acura is no differnt than a g in acceleration id say show me any car in any compo with g where g loses in either stat gearing hp torque  they all add up to driving exctiement if you are left behind then just take it for what it is without gearing excuses or some other anomoly i am supposed to have as an excuse as to why the vq should not be the most respected engine in the 30k car classes i understand the love you have for your car as shown in your numerous posts\\n \\ni have a tl type s and not many cars i think can outrun me factory to factory and class for class last summer a 540 straight out spanked me straight acceleration i know the car is in a differnt class but i thought i could have hanged around with him no sir he pulled away easily if you really want to see how the g can go backwards quickly go up against the 540 remember i warned you 260 lbsft that has to mean something on street drivings g35 has been around longer than new tl so there must have been a lot of test while tl has only been tested a couple times but the result is inconclusive all test are based on standard specification no aspec\\n060\\nedmunds says 65 secs\\ncar and driver says 60 secs\\nan article that i forgot says 57 secs 0100 by edmund nothing 14 miles\\nedmunds 149 secs\\nengine power says 1488\\nanother article says 144 secs\\nabove that only top speed test but that can hardly be achieved on street drivings ive been there man it was very even actually  which is my point i even had the guy ask me what the f i was driving i have plenty of bmws in the circle of friendsfam i know full well what the 5 is about the tls is much different than the new tl in gearing and motor and weight and cd i think id expect the results you described for your car do you have an auto read the stats  none of the 04 cars mentioned 545 notwithstanding are going to be that different really my points about the g are in context of being the new benchmark as opposed to the 3 these differences are not very big but i will suggest they are consistent and in one direction that said i would expect the new tl to hang with a 540 pretty well 62 is the 060 on 540 right guys anyway there is no exact comparo between g35 330 tl 540 35l engine vs 30l engine vs 32l engine vs 40l engine all car are good depends on who drive it i used to race a bike yamaha 250cc but since the accident i would think twice about going all out lets drive safe guys chrisit appears to me you are the one posting that the g cant be beat but dont have any facts to back it up other than it is your opinion because you really like your car everyone gets left behind by someone i am still not convinced that the g is going to consistently leave the other sedans behind since the data isnt out there yet to back up your opinion thats what those multi car shootouts do what will you do when you eventually lose one of those stoplight races because your reaction time was a little slow  yell at them that the g 35 is faster but the driver isnt  there really isnt any point to continue to chant the g 35 mantra since you are the only one who appears to believe it i am willing to admit that they are all nice cars and have different strengths and weaknesses i am not willing to admit that any of the sedans being discussed is a clear cut winner over the others\\nas to the vq being the most respected engine in the 30k classrespected by whothe owner of the car  respect isnt something i give to inanimate objects respect is for people\\nall i hear is a bunch of bench racing respect is for people and as an aside i believe prestige is for people not tires yes the preacher of 6 speeds ive put my time in on a 5 speed to understand yout plight in conviving the world that the only cars worth buying are manual you and kd can spar about that i dont want to break up with my gf and dont want to sit in dc traffic for 3 hours pushing a clutch whenever i go to nc if the car was slower by more than 2 seconds or handled less  id buy that swamp sale get over the manual tranny thing  its old school now that smg 8 and 9 speeds are on the drawing boards personally i hope that ill always have the choice to go to personally engaging the clutch or not you are preaching to someone who used to think that wayas far as troucning me  youll have to be a much better driver and in our hypothetical world these cars are very even 060 you can have if i can have 0100 060 is not a race  you can have your gearing designed to compete directly with the g and then i can get past you to 100 just like the stats show if someone needs me to prove it to them then ill i have to do is simply read back at all the freaking comps posted already  take a look at each one specifying a 0100 and quarter find any car in class that beats g auto to auto or 6 to 6 and i will concede to you whatever you want ive been there before and i thought most of you were already there with me heres some research  i usually leave it to you guys and believe you guys but am capable i swear

we are all over the country and cant actually do it now on the track i know what my car can do in context of the comepititionmore than i should know trust me i know what i belive and the past year of edmundsing is proof the post above is very nice but the acura is faster and the 3 with sp is faster to 60  ive agreed i know someone here has shown the 0100 numbers so ill get them and post them while we sit in all the snow they areh hyping tommorrow danny i notice 060 times from cr was conspicuously absent always the acura vs bmw vs infiniti battle what about the audi 30 quattro with 6 speed  sport package the audi interior and styling alone puts it a class above granted the price gets steep 3840k fully optioned but so does the bimmer yes the g35 and the bmw 330 rwd comparison is essential for king of the sedan honors but add a few others in the mix now we have the g35x i cant wait to see the g35x vs the audi a4 quattro vs the bmw 330xi vs s60 vs legacy gt feb 4th debut great times lie ahead nice car i drove an s4 wagon last month kicks some butt gotta hand it to audi for having the brass to do that format at 54k a real stealth performer though dont try to compare the 540i6 to a g35 automotive press test reports normally had the 540i6 060 mph time in the 5456 second range magnificient automobile 0100mph0 effortlessly had mine up to 140 mph a few times she was relaxed and would do it all day long not to mention 26 mpg on highway i say this having owned a 98 540i6 and driving it almost 30000 miles i did not said that g35 is pretty fast but its not faster than new tl engine on g35 does not feel strong after 4000rpm on the other hand tl has a better feel over 4000 rpm it feels like it has a turbocharged its my opinion so dont get to excited i think if i had a 3900 car i would want it to be just what you desribe relaxed people get bent out of shape at the comparison  that is not to say it belongs in the lux class the g is not meant to be anything but what it is  a not lux vehicle capable of visceral driving to which the best way i can describe it is by comparing its visceral nature to that of the old 928s  not the last year or two of course the g interior was purposefully not too posh  rather industrial and not trying to be bmw while beating the 330i  killing the auto 330i in any timed run outhandling the 330i mathcing the 330zhp in handling beating the 530 matching the 540and i can compare the 5  the luxury goodies aside the cars have very similar sized wheelbases and displacement it does not ride as nicely and its louder and more z likethats what i paid for what do two different cars start withframe and drivetrainall else can be stripped out as far as im concered except one seat and a steering wheel what then  cant compare becasue if you get outhandled and outpaced its not fair i was driving my wife146s accord lx 4cyl on i95 the other day a 330 and g35 racing each other passed us the 330 was in front two miles down the road both of them were pulled over by a cop the 330 was still in front i passed them both so which car is faster my wife146s accord ok chris you win i wont debate this anymore because it has become pointless this has become a my car is biggerfaster than your car statement there is room on this planet for all the vehicles in this class each with a different aspect of prowess the g is faster despite most automotive magazines opinion that they are at least in the same ballpark the g can be directly compared to the new 5 series due to the wheelbase the g has a more visceral feel than the 35 series and the g outhandles and outpaces every 3 series including the m3 but please take this lightly we are all here to have a good time i am debating between the 2004tl and the lexus es330 i am leaning toward the tl but many of the posts i have read mentions various rattles andvibratory noises the es330 exterior is not very appealing but if the tl really has these various noises this would be more troubling to me than outer appearances from those that own the 2004 tl are theses noises really that noticeable there is no conclusiveness about 060 test there are many factors that can influence the result for example road condition weather condition and drivers weight timing and reflexes on rowing those gear even with the same driver and the same car may not get the same result twice we are talking about 110 second difference let alone different driver with different car although its the same modeltype i feel a little vibration also apparently its from the tire but after 12 miles the vibration is gone i heard we can negotiate the trade with the dealer but i havent got the time i might do that when snow dissapeared pg48477 here is the one that you called turbo tl04 will start opening those electric

with the above this is gone beyond the point and scope of my original question there is no way a g35 is going to outrun a 540i unless the 540i driver doesnt know what theyre doing a 540i automatic driven by someone with poor skills maybe but a 6speed come on now thats ridiculous the g35 is like a porsche 928 are you serious like i said before the g35s interior can be different but different

is a prestigious university is wrong lol the exact same tires auto transmission no brake revving just stomp on gas and go 0 to 60 if i had to bet the house id say g then tl then 330i by quarter a car length each but thats just me harvard is a prestigious university is wrong well i consider harvard to be a top flight ivy league university this has become a my car is biggerfaster than your car statement lets remember the original statement that got it all started to put it back into context i am hypothesizing that bmw 3 is no longer the benchmark or the standard based on performance and automotive press again the differences as agreed to be minute but the whole argument you have made for a year now or more is that bmw holds the class trophy for sports sedan superiority and nothing comes close i say based on nothing real anymore  your just used to saying it and rightfully so until 2002 things changed when the japanese stopped putting g20s out there and called them 3 beaters you 3ers got used to having no competition  it doesnt suck for the consumer whose a fan of any competitor a 540i automatic driven by someone with poor skills maybe im sure it was an auto and im sure the poor guy just pressed on the gas real hard and his skills didnt get in the way too bad check another stat on the g and compare  5070 and 560 numbers are very good for the z car platform you guys may find value in many things about many cars  i find value in the thrust and handling that no other car can best in class and a g coupe vs a 928 would be very interesting the z has been compared to the gt3  anybody wanna get pod about that  people have been getting pos at nissan since the 240 i am hypothesizing i would like to focus on the word hypothesizing it is your opinion and ill leave it at that listing the current awards for the 3 series where the articles still say the 3 series is the benchmark is useless because you believe otherwise im not out to change your opinion only to show there is a disconnect betwee your opinion vs the auto mag industry opinions a 540i automatic driven by someone with poor skills maybe im sure it was an auto and im sure the poor guy just pressed on the gas real hard and his skills didnt get in the way too bad check another stat on the g and compare  5070 and 560 numbers are very good for the z car platform lets compare a cayenne twinturbo with a g or z this vehicle can dust both of these on the trackstreet and offroad since it seems not to matter what we are comparing to the g how much it cost or how much it weighs lets us this vehicle as a benchmark or better yet lets use an m5 or even an m3 or even a zhp wait lets even use the new acura 2004 tl since the gz platform compares favorably in price handling speed acceleration to every single vehicle fwdrwdna and forcedair the z has been compared to the gt3  show me where chris a vehicle that can go to 60 in under 4 seconds with a top speed of over 200 mph has been compared to a vehicle that can get to 60 in about 55 slower than an wrxevo with a lower top speed than a wrxevo has been compared to a gt3 ok doesnt make sense to me but if someone said it its gotta be the case i read somewhere the zhp has been compared to the bugatti wow am i impressed at bmw for producing a vehicle that gets mentioned in the same breath as a 1000 hp vehicle ill show you where in the newest evo they went to japan to test drive nismoed 350z and g35coupe they tested the tamest nismo and say its about the rawest you want to drive in the streets at the end of the article this is what the say about the z and im paraphrasing it puts the scare to the gt3 at half the price im sure they didnt mean in a straight line because nismoed z is not any more powerful than regular z but they meant on a racetrack and while youre reading evo kd check how they think reg z is much more of a performance driving machine than z4 30 in the coty contest nismoed 350z and g35coupe that is not a usa certified streetlegal vehicle is it or is it a usa certified vehicle with modified suspension if it is i stand corrected but if not i discount these opinions until tested in the good ol usa with good ol usa license plates not preproduction vehicles not only nissan but bmw as well the point is it wasnt said about any vehicle currently on sale in the us not future vehicles but current vehicles this is an important point that wasnt communicated in the post and while youre reading evo kd check how they think reg z is much more of a performance driving machine than z4 30 in the coty contest ill pick it up thanks for the lead nismo is starting to offer its products to usa for first time i believe so yes they will become us legal soon and those nismos rely on suspension and dynamics because the mod z only has 291 hp and strangely enough the mod g35c has less than the us g35c undoubtedly because the jdm g35c is not as powerful just to show you products from nissan fm platform can hang with much much more expensive german machinery id trust testing from those hardcore brit magazines much more than from individual manufacturers which has lots of axes to grind just to show you products from nissan fm platform can hang with much much more expensive german machinery correct with mods ala m adding a supercharger to the m3 zhp with suspension upgrades would get a commesurate increase in powerhandling capabilities as well maybe thats why bmw doesnt offer performance upgrades it wants you to buy their cars but nissan needs to compete because it only has one model acura has is rspecaspec with 300hp everybodys doing it correct with mods ala m what the mods are suspension only in the gt3 comparison the platforms horsepower notwithstanding are the basis for the argument that the 3 is now bested its not a stretch to see why when you look at the global accolades this platform gets id take plain z and a carrera to the track anyday and take my chances in either that car shares 90 of underpinnings with g the engine hp wars dont mean a dam thing here you are changing the subject the platforms being compared are in the same class and the accolades falling on the g and her cousins are telling  with non m type of upgrades kd as for the aspec  still fwd  still low torque  its only another 30hp  another 30 over the accords that make it 60 too many i bet those fat sweet tires will help  what are those 29521s why is everyone so worried about if the g is a tad bit better than the 3 series simple truth is the g or z will never reach the pinacle of true vehicle perfection that the 3 once had nothing could touch it for four or so years there the 3 series is an old car the g is much newer the fact that the 3 series kept atop the extremely competitive automobile industry for so long is a testament to just how good this car really is as long as bmw doesnt screw this car up i am sure the next 3 series will blow every competing vehicle away once again i personally feel that the advantages of having a g35 over a 3 series is one price and two having a much more rare car i hardly ever get to see a g while i probably see two 3 series everytime i go out chris  1 it aint anything till its sold in the us and is approved by the govt\\n2 as mariner said hp was tweaked also no problem with that but as i say mods ala m\\n3 you are talking about the 350z which is two seater and the g35 coupe compare the g35 coupe to the 330cic with performance package 350z to the z4 the m3 is still untouchable in your fervor to proclaim the 3 series dead you are comparing a two seater to a 4 seater and citing references to products not being sold in the us i guess you need to do that because it cant happen any other way whatever comp you want kd ill feel pretty good running even with g auto sedan against a zhp 4 door 6 speed you want to bring the 2 doors into it feel free  it only gets better i never crossed a 2 or a 4 door the carerra and the gt3 are two seaters compared to a 2 seat z let me know where you got crossed and ill help you out g is not that much better but it did put the benchmark on its ear and we all reap the benefitsthe only point i have ever really been adamant about is the g dethroning 3 the 3 cant deserve the becnhmark as many agree we dont have to agree  we just have to make sure we are happy with our choices  and they get harder each year i cant wait for 2007 or 2008 i may be in a bmw then  the whole analysis starts over then on level playing field and i get to enjoy the process again it may be a hyundia by then too the less marquis the better sleepers rule you want to bring the 2 doors into it feel free thanks chris for your help lets compare a drag racer against the z and see who wins seems like you like to bring everything into the mix even though you cant buy it and ride down the street with it heck in 2007 i may even be brave enough to go over to the nissaninfiniti side of the house im not proud if bmw cant do it someone else can a rwd acura and better branded rwd lexus if done properly would trounce the z on the japan inc playing field i hope nissan is watching because lexus knows how to do it and has the cash that is really the car i want to own a lexus branded bmw i wont mind paying a premium for it either i didnt bring it into the mix  the thoroughly impressed gt3 driver did obviously several iterations of this arguemnt can cause a loss of focus you lexus thing is a good idea except to date nothing in the lineup is impressive and i just heard the supra was going to be too expensive and they canned it for reasons similar to the first canning in the 90s not a lot of toyota rd goes into fm type platforms or sports cars its all subject to change im sure a rwd acura and better branded rwd lexus if done properly would trounce the z on the japan inc playing field i hope nissan is watching because lexus knows now you are comparing to cars that dont exist yetby the time those come off the drawing board  nissan will have the gtr out and and m45 but if theres something out there that rocks the auto world like the g ill be the first in line i love a benchmark blaster  bring me more i was just chatting with some old 5 series owners at my fav forum  theres a thead about 5 owners converting to g and its pretty interestingespecially the 540 converts who wished theyd put the extra 300 a month into a house or fund present value of 300 a month for 48 months at 7 is about 12500 present value of 300 a month for 48 months at 7 is about 12500 correct thats why some people i know instead of buying lexus infiniti bmw buy hyundai present value of 25000 for 10 years is what you dont have to skip buying a 540 to save money you can skip buying infiniti also and save a bundle at the end buy that m5 for cash come on chris  people who are really serious about saving money dont even buy cars over 1011k much less buying a bmw or infiniti come on kd  people who get the 5 get lux gooidies and granted some substance but not 12k worth imo if hyundia puts up a g beater ill be the first in line especially if it saves me money id pay 25k for a loaded h35 if it runs like g 35 there is no point of dragging one opinion to one xtreme side just like my dad told me dont eat too much otherwise you will become fat so i wont eat at all thats not gonna work you can buy any car which suited you best compare all the goodness and the bad and get the best value of it some people prefer the best brand name in the market some people like one of the best brand name and others just doesnt care about brand best brand name does not always come with more features more luxury better performance etc besides there is no absolute answer for which brand is actually the best car is one of the worst investment and investment doesnt mix well with this thread you going over board with nissaninfiniti brand they just caught up with the market by making one car g35z350 dont forget this is the only car that worth talking everything else infiniti builds is a bust g35 is not better performance car than 3 series and does not have overall value of tl i think that infiniti has a long way to go fwiw ive read the posts over the last few days with some amusement what a great world we live in if youve got 3040k to spend on a car huh bmw audi infiniti acura caddywhatever things just keep getting better huh i just traded my 99 328i e46 for a g35x i absolutely loved the 328i but the abs pump went and i figured the 2500 repair price was a good excuse to go shopping before that the car was rocksolid never a problem really the g35x was just the best value for me out there its beautiful imho of course has awd and a great engine with more power but not as smoothrevving as my bmw while also giving me more room than my bmw oh and it was about 6k less than the comparable 3series today 330ix although i dont think the 6k is all prestige  theres definitely something special about a 3 i testdrove the acura tl and its a pretty amazing bargain didnt care for the fwd feel or the dealers in my area or id probably be driving one today interior is amazing puts infiniti and bmw to shame during my test drives for what its worth the engine didnt feel as good as the g35s but a test drive isnt a great place to evaluate such things cars need about several thousand miles on them before the engines loosen up anyway the bmw with sport and summer tiresfelt lighter and more agile than my new g35x but the g35x feels more powerful and rides better both are awesome cars one other note about all of the posted tests from magazines i love reading about cars but the comparos really are sometimes apples to oranges for example bmws are always tested with the sport package and summer tires usually pilots most other cars are tested with allseason tires mention is rarely made of that difference it certainly must account for some of the skidpad and steering response results in bmws defense they have the guts to put topflite performance tires on their cars so they should get creditnot like the crap turanza el42s that came on my g35x anyhow my overall point is that after having owned a bmw 3 for over five years and extensively test driving an audi a4 acura tl and g35x i can say that i honestly think i could have been incredibly happy with any of these four cars if caddy can get their buildquality up im sure they will be another player for those who dont think theres something special about a 3series bmw you really need to own one for a while i fell in love and might very well find myself back in a bmw down the line the g35x is a different and amazing car though and for me its the best of whats out there today heck even if youre looking in the 25k range you have the passat mazda6 accord altima and camry whatever you choose in whichever class what a great time to be car shopping  im sure it was an auto and im sure the poor guy just pressed on the gas real hard and his skills didnt get in the way too bad check another stat on the g and compare  5070 and 560 numbers are very good for the z car platform you guys may find value in many things about many cars  i find value in the thrust and handling that no other car can best in class  no problem with the latter part of this about the g35 but the 540i surely isnt in the gs class its several classes above it and in the hands of a skilled driver the g35 doesnt have a prayer with a 540i it really doesnt say much for the g to be compared to the porsche 928 especially since the car was designed in the seventies there used to be a website called httpwww4carcouk and they had all kinds of comparos such as the one youve made here before their demise they had a test in which the audi s6 euro model only xjr pre 04 and m5 were competing with a used to be untouchable ferrari the 512tr which started out as the testarossa in the 1980s and guess whatthe m5 beat the ferrari in every measure point being that cars simply advance i dont know what a 350z would do other than get humiliated by a 911 gt3 i can mention a sl55 amg in same breath as an carrera gt in some areas bit that doesnt mean the sl55 is comparable overall m the m5 beat the ferrari in every measure i recognize the 5 is a couple notches higher than the g  but im stating that performance alone transcends class which is not based on size and displacement but on lux items and ride quality hey i want an m5 as much as anyonesee some of my past posts the edmunds home page today has the g35 review from archives and it specifically mentions the target as the 540i  as well as the m5 whoever suggested infiniti has a long way  hello  fx35 and 45 which are porsche beaters fir 40k less upcoming m45  which exists in japan now things we arent fortuante enough drive here like the skylines and gtrs theres enough here to keep me happy g35 is not better performance car than 3 series  have you just joined us i agree performance does transcend classes by my point is that if youre just looking for speed a z28 ss will outrun all of the cars g35 540i etc but it doesnt compare overall the g35 is a hell of a car of which the coupe i will be considering but compared to a 5series overall its not in the same league just because infiniti mentions the 5series and m5 as targets doesnt mean theyve met those targets imo and experience with both cars theyve fallen short of a normal 5series overall and its too surreal to even think about a g35 competeing with a m5 m the target was the 540 and the old m3 not m5 considering the success of the g35 i would not put it past nissaninfiniti to put out a performance version of the g35 we all know that the vq35 can be tuned for more hp unless ofcourse they dont want to outdo the 350z or the upcoming gtr first fx is not a car its an suv and second it does not sell that well m45 did not came out yet so as i said they do have a long long way to go i joined this threat a while ago maybe before you did i know that you think g35 is better than 3 series does not mean that its true for those that havent read it this is how they stacked up 35k sport sedans all stick shift in rank order 1 infiniti g35\\n2 bmw 325i\\n3 acura tl the new one\\n4 lexus is300\\n5 audi a4 30 quattro\\n6 saab 93 arc personally id put the volvo s60 t5 on that list before the audi but hey its all about personal preferences right how did you came up with this list does not look right please post a link speedracer3 check out how consumer reports ranks them 3 series and is300 at top g35 near bottom thinking g35 was around 10th or 12th out of the 15 cars in their category for this segment not sure where you got the purported cd rankings the cd comparisons ive read tested the 330i with the g35 and is300 are you citing a recent comparison test or looking at different tests thinking the last published complete cd test of 325i manual was around january 2001 riez is right consumer reports ranked tl first 330 second and g35 was in a bottom 5 out of 15 cars riez is right consumer reports ranked tl first 330 second and g35 was in a bottom 5 out of 15 cars and pg is correct also however cr did say the handling on the 330i was better now why did i get that model they will not review the 3 series until the next revamp however i suspect if the zhp had been reviewed the tl would still have won on the value component but the zhp would have mopped up the performancehandling aspect now why would one buy a zhp the latest car  driver rated the manual versions as g35 325 tl is300 a4 93 arc xtype 30 in the sports sedan category the tl gets hurt by fwd they eliminated the 330 from the test due to price the is300 did well considering it had the lowest price and all the other cars were newer designs the is300 did well considering it had the lowest price and all the other cars were newer designs ummm last time i checked the is300 came out in 2001 and the e46 3series came out in 1999 how does that make a 325i a newer design than the is300 best regards\\nshipo i think the is was introd in the us the summer 2000 as a 2001 prior to that it was sold in japanasia as the toyota altezza for a couple of years here is a picture of a 98 httpenglishautovlrucatalogtoyotaaltezza1998_10photo your right about 1999 for the e46 the first ones were the 323  328 and then they changed engines in 2000 much to the chagrin of the 99 owners i cant find the link that showing the new chart the only thing that i found is g35 coupe as 10 best car 2004 this is quoted from infinitycom\\ng35 wins 2004 car and driver 10best award 01062004 the g35 is once again recognized as one of the years 10best cars from car and driver which looks for stunning styling terrific technology and excellent value in its winners according to car and driver the g35 pushes all the right buttons to renew its 10best membership they eliminated the 330 from the test due to price they dont want tl cuz of fwd and they put 325 in second place while its stats for 060 is above 7 secs what were they comparing if not for speed luxury price rwd from that perspective i think that the 3series might still be older i seem to remember that the e46 went on sale in europe in late 1997 or early 1998 yes no best regards\\nshipo first fx is not a car its an suv its built on the fm platform the same as the g35 and its most certainly not an offroading vehicle its closer to what bmw calls an sav semantics and second it does not sell that well nissaninfinitis consistently moving about 3k fxs a month thats about the same as the g35 sedan m45 did not came out yet funny the m45s ive seen on the road seem to say otherwise nissan sells only a few hundred a month though the new m isnt out yet but the same old one is still selling im a fan of bmw heck i own one but theres no reason to make up things about infiniti shipo yeah the current bmw 3 has been kicking around for eons the first ones to hit us shores were in 98 bmw sure takes its time with redesigns not that im upset as i love the look of my 3 kd wrote but the zhp would have mopped up the performancehandling aspect now why would one buy a zhp not sure why any fool would buy a zhp oh wait maybe we love the 3 package but wanted something a bit more raw and as close to an m3 as we could get with 4 doors i still lust after that 32 though duh i had a 328i built in 1998  best regards\\nshipo no links go to your newstand and pick up the march 2004 issue of car and driver sorry if the list upset some of you but i can assure i didnt come up or make up the list please dont shoot the messanger if you dont like message does riez ever have a post that doesnt mention the is300  just a question not really surprised the tl did not win considering their utter hatred of fwd but take a look at the chart that comes up with the points the tl is winning by around 6 points through all the categories and loses at the end because of 2 utterly subjective things gotta have it factor\\nfun to drive okay i will give them the fun to drive one as a valid point to have in a comparison but what the hell is the gotta have it they ranked the audi below the infiniti which i am sorry i think it is much more prestigious to have an audi vs an infiniti but these 2 categories bumped the tl down 2 spots out did a 04 tl i find that very amusing i think my automatic 03 tls will beat this car in most category oh by the way that is why i did not renew my subscription with them too partial to bimmers too partial to bimmers may for a reason that you and i miss i missed onein seventh place jaguar xtype 30 they ranked the audi below the infiniti which i am sorry i think it is much more prestigious to have an audi vs an infiniti prestige its a car you might make a case for a bentley lambo or a rolls carrying some cache but thats about it thats only because theyre handcrafted not stamped assembly line chunks of metal its this prestigesnobbery that makes me lie to people about what kind of car i own i mention my mazda when people ask about my car because im sick of the stupid comments people make about my bimmer the comparo wasnt about prestige anyway it was about who made the best sport sedan out there i think the sportier cars are well represented at the top of the list g17 i currently own 2 is300s an03 automatic and an 04 manual what do you think my inclination to talk about revolves around not unlike kdshapiro who loves his bmw these two iss replaced bmws an 00 323ia and a 98 540i6 prior to that i had owned two infiniti g20t a 96 impala ss a 97 camaro and a 00 lincoln ls8 sport i love performance cars cr rt cd etc all hold the is300 in high esteem it is a great car high value for the money maximum smiles per mile not unlike kdshapiro who loves his bmw exactly maybe ill talk about how much i love my neighboors accord coupe that is the point the acura won the comparo until utterly subjective criteria was thrown in fun to drive is fine but gotta have it if they are going to do that at least pay attention to the public audi is more gotta have it than ininiti if it was just a comparo on sports sedans the tl would have been second or arguably first is pretty commonplace in the rags ive seen many times when the numbers all point to one car and they declare the other the winner simply because they want to but i dont necessarily read them for their opinions i read them for specs tests pics etc kdshap and riez  not everyone need restrict themselves to what they own i for instance am very happy and proud of my vehicle but i am a staunch supporter of many others out there i have had countless occasions where someone says oh you must be a widget owner because you are singing its praises and in fact i am not an owner of said vehicle here i have been singing the praises of the tl but dont own one go figure i got news for you comparos are subjective all you are getting is some car writers opinion about what car he likes granted a car writers opinion carries a lot more weight than ours because these guys critique cars for a living besides utterly subjective criteria are what we call intagibles they play a major role in chosing a car over another we are talking in circles i agree there should be subjectivity in the reviews otherwise i would look at cr or one of the other plain magazines my point is in a sports sedan comparison dont have a prestige subjectivity section fun to drive you bet for that reason i think i would choose the g35 as i have no doubt it is more fun to drive but iand i assume most others really could care less about what car the writers would rather be seen in those are as you said major reasons that we the buyers use to choose a car prestige is also subjective some think of audi as a more expensive volkswagen or a lexus as a rebadged toyota i happen to like my audi a4 regardless of where it falls on car  drivers list it very luxurious sporty and economical all at the same timebut i agree with the reviewers that its not sporty enough to be at the top of the list as you say who cares what they write its what you like that counts as you say who cares what they write its what you like that counts thats the end all and be all i could care less if a magazine named a car to the top 10 or named its engine one wards 10 best or made it the motor trend car of the year that has zero bearing on how i feel about the car when it comes to rating cars like movies and food nobody else can really tell you whats good until you test it yourself they ranked the audi below the infiniti which i am sorry i think it is much more prestigious to have an audi vs an infiniti i guess ill be avoiding audi brand forver isnt the a4 a passat not much prestige there sharing platforms with the peoples car and the 05 passat is on its own better platformgets less prestigious from there either you want a badge or a killer car with performanceor a combination theres no way an a4 is anywhere near as fun as a g35 i went from a passat to a g35 so i speak from experience even if by proxyand went vw back then to save money and avoid the snooti factorwho wants people acting like i should buy them lunch all the time and just for fun ill throw in that my 02 indigo blue passat got way more compliments than my g35  so maybe the prestige thing really is not there for the g  thank god you are exactly right i am testimony to that i have said this several times but let me repeat i remember when i was researching the mazda millenia back in 1998all the car forums including edmunds gave this car negative reviews i test drove the car and leased it for 36 trouble free months the car was solid as a rock no sqeaks or rattles just well builtlots of compliments from people i do read and check out car forums but in the end i am master and commander of what i buy conversations about bragging rights and those about actual decision making are obviousthose of us who brag already made our decision and purchased are any of these sedans truly prestigous dont think so lets put a reality check on this yes they are all premium rides they all have a level of prestige and cache and status by virtue of the fact they cost a bit more than the average car money typicaly breeds exclusivity exclusivity breeds prestige cache status but marketers have done a great job over the last 1015 years by bringing the hint of true luxury to the masses thats why we have this new premiun category so when i think prestige or some other snobby adjective i think ferrari lamborghini maserati porsche v12 benzsjagsbmws maybachs and true old classics of these brands its hard for me to see prestige when i see more bmws than tauruses on the freeway its hard for me to see prestige when i see more bmws than tauruses on the freeway i agree in my neck of the woods its more s500s than civics granted a car writers opinion carries a lot more weight than ours ill pass on that opinion where there is advertising there are sycophants also too much political correctness not enough candor there are some guys in these forums who know what they are talking about theres nothing like figuring out who they are and communicating with them like everyone in this particular thread  this on top of separating the wheat from the chaff in auto reviews then coming to ones own conclusion based on research and test drives is where its at imo btw i know the following isn146t exactly a cogent example but ever read the reviews in gannett papers theyre virtually useless i got news for you comparos are subjective all you are getting is some car writers opinion about what car he likes now youre talkin ive driven a passat and own an a4 and they drive nothing alike so while they share platforms and engines please dont throw them both in the same category one is a family car the other is a sporty sedan drive a passat isnt like driving an a4 same platform does not equate to same road feel 2001 a4 v 2001 passat a4 is 50 lbs lighter 8 inches shorter and has a 3 inch smaller wheelbase the smaller car will definitely handle differently qbrozen i buy what i love i might like other things but i wouldve bought em if i had loved em i love i6 engines manual transmissions rwd irs and lsd prefer a sedan due to family needed something with great reliability and great crash test results other than m3 there isnt anything that meets my criteria and the is300 meets them and is reliable and safe m5 would too as i also love v8s but way out of my budget i was talking about cars it does no matter that fx is a crossover it still not a car\\ni meant new m45 we all know that current m45 is a bust just like q45 you can say that again and again its hard for me to see prestige when i see more bmws than tauruses on the freeway hard for me not to agree with that but i will say no matter how many more bmws than tauruses are on the road each and every bmw is still a premium ride while the taurus is not who cares about prestige heck we cant even truly define it in a way most of us could agree on isnt the point to spend your hard earned money on a car you love to drive so what if others also enjoy it maybe great minds think alike or at least great drivers think there is nothing sadder than car buyers who worry more about how theyll be viewed or what their neighbors drive or how many are on the road rather than on what is really important whether the car meets their needs is something they can afford and brings a smile to their face when driven hard heck id rather drive a late 1980s or early 1990s taurus sho with the yamahaderived 30l v6 and manual transmission than most e46 323i325i heck id rather drive a late 1980s or early 1990s taurus sho with the yamahaderived 30l v6 and manual transmission than most e46 323i325i but as i recall you did just that sedans dont have prestige but car makers do 3 series and cclass cost more partially because of prestige factoror how ever you want to call it of the car company bmw and mb why else you think they make m5 m3 and amg im sure bmw makes much more money on 325 than m3 m is there just to keep up the brand name kdshapiro i couldnt afford to get a then new taurus sho with the yamahaderived 30l v6 and manual transmission back then i could only afford one car and my wife couldnt drive a stick the 00 323ia was hers id never get an automatic and id only have sport pkg around 1990 id have taken the sho over the 3 series it was a great sleeper performance sedan too bad ford let it die a horrible death but then the new 5 series reminds me of that way of dying i fear for the next generation 3 series im waiting to see the 1 series m is there just to keep up the brand name m is a way to differentiate the super higher performance vehicles from the flock its a successful marketing opportunity that has produced the best in world class sports sedans m just didnt happen bmws were hot in the 1930s the 507 is a super classic from the 1950s bmw has long been involved in motorcycle and automobile racing m has nearly 25 years of history didnt the m1 come out around 1979 prior to that great tuners like hartage ac schnitzer and alpina worked closely with bmw to build hot cars m wouldnt have happened without the prior history and racing history audi learned how hard it is to create a highperformance marque mb did it by buying out amg cadillac will learn this with its v acura is trying with its new aspec cars heck even saturn is trying with its red line shows you there is either money in them thar hills or they know the presitge turns into sales down or up the rest of the line yes but dint forget that any company is there to make money as we all know m is one of the best performance vehicles but it is not very profitable for bmw so all i am saying is that bmw build it to promote the brand but it is not very profitable for bmw is this info in their annual report how would one know that who cares about prestige they know the prestige turns into sales down or up the rest of the line i dont have a link because i read it in news paper we all know its true and there is nothing wrong with that we all know its true and there is nothing wrong with that i didnt know its true and i find it very interesting doesnt bode well as a business model for other manufacturers then magazines and newspapers really have many ways to improve its sales there is nothing wrong with it but in the end facts that can be compared measured and tested will reveal its truth like \\n1 performance like speed accelaration\\n2 size\\n3 luxury features and amenities\\n4 price cost etc\\n5 sales figures\\n6 tecnology\\n7 mpg\\nand many other which can be measured by anyone and easy to measure i believe evryone can see measure compare them and the most important thing is agreeable easily by most people fun excitementetc are hard to measure just like gokart bumpercar its fun if they put tl in the comparo they should have known that tailout sensation is a gotta have factor but they still did and it still won third place and it will really boost the sales of the magazines people will start thinking how why whats wrong etc and people will start buying the magazine very smart indeed btw there are many magazines that make such comparison and these magazines usually have ads as other source of profit these cars are built to supply an income based market i have never had the money to purchase such vehicles three teenage kids at home but i have taken rides in some of them they are truly nice vehicles but are we getting the real story with them are the owners going to fill out a subjective jd powers survey on a car they love and paid so much for are magazines going to give you the real dirty poop on a car they are paid to advertise i dont know they have suffered from time to time with reliability issues but you are still getting premium features for your dollars i can only imagine what it would be like to ride in a hand built car with fine leather and premium hardwoods it has to be a great feeling but i do think that the japanese are world class when it comes to reliability through out their lines are the owners going to fill out a subjective jd powers survey on a car they love and paid so much for i depends ive always thrown out the jd powers surveys even though i have had some vehicles that in the end were super and in the end were soup i think if you have a problematic vehicle you have more of an axe to grind in fact i asked a number of people recently how many jd powers or cr surveys they ever submitted the answer didnt surprise me 0 are magazines going to give you the real dirty poop on a car they are paid to advertise i hope they are impartial thats why i dont based a buying decision on a magazine article its just another data point a first hand reference others call them anecdotal evidence means more than the article but you are still getting premium features for your dollars a truer statment was never said but i do think that the japanese are world class when it comes to reliability through out their lines all in all in my experience out of the 5 in a row japanese vehicles i owned 1 i had for 2 years 1 i had for 12 years and the other 3 were always going back to the dealer for something or another im glad i got rid of them in 3 years actually ill be glad to get rid of the bimmer cant enjoy it lately too much traffic and deteriorating roads make it impossible to drive the car 10 feet without hitting fairly large potholes while i really like the x3 itll be more of the same with the impossible roads maybe get a cheap fwd saturn and take the 18 grand thats left over and use it as a downpayment on a cheap vacation home fun excitementetc are hard to measure just like gokart bumpercar its fun fun and excitement is what i live for i live my life for the intangibles how much did i enjoy the food how much did i enjoy the vacation while its all nice to know the subjective attributes its the intangibles that make life worth living motor trend has an article reporting bmw sales increasing 45 over last year the sales increase was spearheaded by sales of the mini\\nthe article also mentions that mini is bringing a 200 hp version to the us market i have never driven a mini but i did sit in one and it reminded me of my crx si days it should be a very fun car to drive maybe when i finally get tired of feeding my 59 liter v8 suv i will go back to something that is pure fun we dont have the same kind of weather in the northwest as the east and midwestmild winters most of the time so the roads dont take as big a beating crx sis rule  wish they had an awd turbo back in 89 with 150 hp too much traffic and deteriorating roads make it impossible to drive the car 10 feet without hitting fairly large potholes most urban areas suffer from this and its getting much worse some of the benefits to owning and driving todays advanced luxury performance cars are lost to horrendous road conditions and yet some of the automakers are designing more cars as if we all drove on race track like roads every day heres a good example taken from a recent car  driver road test of the new bmw z4 the one major flaw is the way in which the steering wheel dances wildly in your hands from road undulations this is the downside of the z4s newfound handling acumen the taut tuning and unyielding runflat tires of the sportpackage car mean every truck trough pavement cyst and chuckhole takes a yank at the front wheels and hence the steering wheel versions with the standard suspension should have less bump steer but all z4s come with runflat tires sharpedged pavement will still send a solid enough thwack through the structure to make you wish youd swerved around the nasty patch my point is i prefer a non biased report which doesnt accept ads which buy its own product for a test like that cr is the only one nothing wrong with g35 being on top but 325i makes me laugh fun and excitement is a plus but not wise for mature people it ends quickly in life dont you think lol you right about magazines they are getting paid by manufacturers one source that is not getting paid is consumer reports and they had 2004tl over other 15 cars in this class like 330 g35 and others why you think acura makes nsx most urban areas suffer from this and its getting much worse some of the benefits to owning and driving todays advanced luxury performance cars are lost to horrendous road conditions and yet some of the automakers are designing more cars as if we all drove on race track like roads every day i only drive my bmw on weekends now so i probably enjoy it 1000 more i crave the chance to get into it after a week tooling around in a banal mazda that said even driving daily in rush hour with my bmw i never tired of the cars rougher ride sloppy stickshift and my bellicose demeanor i agree shapiro it is getting hard to take an enjoyable ride if its not the potholes its the traffic i just posed the questions as food for thought i dont claim to know the answers but they seem to have a muddy side to them i have filled out only one jd powers survey on a new vehicle but i am pretty hard on all products vary rarely giving tens to even top notch brands i feel that we pay to much for most anything we buy anyway so it better be stellar toyota and honda have made a lucrative living on reputation i understand that you have had problems with your japanese cars so maybe this reputation is media built or grounded in some fact i have owned toyota before and i did not experience the problems you have had i have owned toyota before and i did not experience the problems you have had it wasnt the toyota or the honda i had problems with it was the nissans however having said that with the toyota it was the water pump the generator the radiator the water pump the generator the power steering pump etc windshield wiper motors etc but all in all over a 12 year period i cant complain too much on your nissans did you have fuel injection problems just was wondering my mom and dads took a crap on their maxima anyway if you decide to go with the property enjoy it it is a better investment after all is said and done wow the 325i 43693 outsold the 330i 9422 by almost 5 to 1 in 2003 most 3series buyers are passing up on what many have argued is the benchmark and opting instead for a rather underpowered car in its class especially since most 325is are automatics most people who buy a bmw 3series buy it for the propeller emblem on the hood and truck lid and not for benchmark performance riez said who cares about prestige obviously 325i buyers do most people who buy a bmw 3series buy it for the propeller emblem on the hood and truck lid and not for benchmark performance actually the benchmark 3series vehicle is the m3 what does that tell you that the 325 outsold the m3 why dont you personally ask the 3series buyers including my friends why they bought their vehicles not because of the propellor but because of the what engineering the propeller represents in said vehicle its a fact folks lower cost items outsell higher cost items look at the ratio of kias sold to ferraris the 325i 5speed manual with sport pkg is a wonderful car the 330i is just that much better yes it is too bad that so many buyers buy bmws with automatics and without the sport pkg but at least these are available but the problem with automatics is pandemic in usa europeans buy a much higher percentage of their cars with manual transmissions but their gasoline is also about 35 times more expensive per gallon what is it about 90 of all vehicles sold in usa are with slushboxes bmw does sell a significant portion of 3 series with manual transmissions thankfully the m3 and m5 are manual only technically even the smg is still a true manual no torque converter but do i care what others buy nope buy what you love and forget about everyone else that the majority of the 43693 bmw 325i buyers bought the car because of the what engineering the propeller represents theres at least a half dozen cars that can outperform the 325 for less money including the v6s accord camry altima the list goes on that the majority of the 43693 bmw 325i buyers bought the car because of the what engineering the propeller represents  you better believe thats why they bought it you have a better reason snobbishness maybe ah i forgot nobody knows the heart of the bmw buyer like yourself btw none of the cars outhandle the 325 outperform yes outhandle no tough to beat bmw handling capabilities for sure i guess my real point is that most bmw buyers especially at the entry level dont really appreciate bmw engineering and all its attributes they buy for status and thats just too bad most people who buy a bmw 3series buy it for the propeller emblem on the hood and truck lid and not for benchmark performance i agree that most 25 buyers are emblem chasers theres at least a half dozen cars that can outperform the 325 for less money including the v6s accord camry altima the list goes on thats ludicrous the various v6 sedans except for the slow camry can pull to 60 faster than an auto 325i but their handling is lightyears behind a 325i sorry but theres far more to performance than straight line acceleration id rather an auto 325 than to ever suffer daily with a fwd piece of junk like an accord camry or altima powers not worth much if the car understeers into corners and lacks the ability to leave a corner at wot lets see whos opinion should i take seriously blueguydotcoms or the more than 800000 people who bought accords and camrys last year h e l l o  question  anyone know the dates of the chicago auto show im thinking of taking a run down there friday february 6 to 15 2004 httpwwwchicagoautoshowcom m3 sales for 2003 4687 while in 2002 5625\\n330i sales for 2003 is 9422 units while in 2002 11479 units\\nwhat does it mean tl and accord 2004 with vsavehicle stability assist and tcstraction control system manage to make tl to weave faster through the 600feet than its competitor this makes the tl one of the fastest cars weve ever taken through the cones quoted from edmund john dipietro 600 feet slalom test result\\ntl 04 675 mph edmund full test drive\\n330i__

mph\\nquoted from 20032004 family sedan comparison test\\nspecifications and performance\\nby erin riches these test result proves acura engineer has done a bit too far for a fwd in a nonstraightline test is this what you mean by handling or is it just your feeling outside of badge chasers the price delta for the 330 puts it outside the sweet spot for the market 3035k base msrp for the 325 4dr is 28795 and the 330 4dr is 35895 and it is pretty hard not to end up with 3k4k of options on either car for daily city and highway driving id take the accord v6 over the 325i the 325i just feels too sluggish much like a fourcylinder accord in the twisties the 325i is definitely more fun i wouldnt say that the accord camry and altima are pieces of junk but thats just my opinion how does anyone in here know what the main reason was for over 40k people to buy a 325i as some have said the 325i is only lacking in go power compared to a much lesser cars like an accord or camry none of these lesser cars will ever drive or feel like a bmw straightline numbers are not the sole indication of performance slalom numbers not knocking the acura tl say nothing about how these cars perform these tests why is it that these same people couldnt have bought the car for other reasons other than snob appeal how about they like the sizestylenuances a bmw provides m it is hard to see or compare intangible remarks like feels looks style nuances pride prestige\\nhard to compare and hard to be agreed on by everyone numbers can be proven by everyone feelings i dont feel the same like other cuz everyone is different size of the tl is bigger especially the back seat i dont even know why 800k people chosed accord and camry in the first place these 800k people might think their car is better than ferrari who knows besides people know about bmw for years and bias is a huge factor they still feel good in them while never set foot in another car for me right is right good is good and bad is bad i wont say this car is a bit slow but its a famous brand no offense speaking of the altima here are some photos of the 2005 version with a much needed upgraded interior httpwwwnissannewscommultimedianissan2005altimashtml this bodes well for the supposed interior upgrade in the 2005 or 2006 g35 well see pretty darn good if theyre willing to change the altimas interior that much i cant wait to see the g35 coupe the interior is the only real fault i find with the g35 coupe i guess the maxima has to soldier on for a few more years with its awful interior since it was a new model just last year m bmw completed one if its best years ever so to say january sales are down who cares as far as through the cones yes its a good figure for the tl braking is all over the place look at the cd result what does cr quote for its emergency handling if all i did was drive the tl through cones that is that car i would get while cr is the most impartial of the bunch those numbers dont make any sense to me my guess is there are some apples to pineapples comparison with the equipment i fully would expect the g35 to dust everybody in the slalom which is what ive seen in every other comparo except the cr that is because cr did not rereview these two models as a magazine would when doing a real comparo i dont even know why 800k people chosed accord and camry in the first place reliability and good price period get from here to there with no muss no fuss like gas and electric accords and camrys are public utilities plus most people dont have a clue what performance is about every edmunds poster is a car genius compared to whats out there to get the most out of a 325i or 330i you have to buy one with the sport pkg the cars without are not nearly as capable as those that do have this package cant imagine why anyone buys a bmw without sport pkg just compare the tire sizes and tire brandmodel between a sport pkg and nonsport pkg 325i check out the latest issue of cd to see what a sport pkg equipped 325i manual can do may lack power but the rest of the car brakes steering suspension etc fully competitive as much as some bmw owners on this board like to deny it push it under the rug and say it isnt so bmw owners have a reputation of buying their cars stricly as a status symbol i find it amazing that no other automobile brand has such a negative stereotype associated with their name i find it amazing that no other automobile brand has such a negative stereotype associated with their name ummm hummer mercedesbenz ferrari rollsroyce bentley porsche maserati jaguar lamborghini land rover and aston martin have an identical if not more so stereotype in my mind best regards\\nshipo we disagree those brands dont carry the same negative stereotype that bmw has about its owners we disagree those brands do carry the same negative stereotype that bmw has about its owners  ummm doesn146t that mean that we agree best regards\\nshipo so did you actually mean to say we disagree those brands dont carry the same negative stereotype that bmw has about its owners  that being the case i would beg to differ i think that the owners of every brand i listed have at least as much of a negative stigma attached to them as do the owners of bmws i mean after all look at the idiots that drive hummers whats up with that other than look at me im big and im bad the rest of you are a bunch of nothings best regards\\nshipo if i have read correctly i do believe the other really big bmw supporter in this discussion kdshap has a nonsport 330 so it looks like there is a division line even in your own camp if all i did was drive the tl through cones that is that car i would get kds the list would be\\n1 if all i did was to test the 060 010014 mile top speed\\n2 if all i wanted was more size than a civic\\n3 if all i wanted was dvda dts 51\\n4 if all i wanted was new lookdesign\\n5 if all i wnted was more feature and amenities\\n6 if all i wanted was more horsepower\\n7 if all i wanted was more space on back seat\\n8 if all i wanted was sorry too many if the benchmark sales sinking maybe its time to put 325i as the benchmark but i still think highly of other series like the 567 they are fabulous i dont care what cr thinks only the stats numbers that matter sport package might help the bimmers thats a fact but dont forget about other car sport package like the aspec 300 hpbetter suspensionstability brakes etc i own an accord too and i have my own opinion about how good the car is like those 800k people very satisfied to get the most out of a 325i or 330i you have to buy one with the sport pkg the cars without are not nearly as capable as those that do have this package ill agree here 3series is loose without sp i find a much bigger difference with sp on 3series than on 5series lower cg combined with less weight make the sp difference more pronounced than on 5series it becomes more of a sports car than the 5series could ever hope to be cant imagine why anyone buys a bmw without sport pkg riez what is it you dont understand its money and the different expectations people have not exactly phenomena im not inclined to do switchbacks with a 5 would find it much more pleasurable with a 3 hmmm i have tossed both through the curves and find my 530i sp possibly even better than the 325i sp that i put through its paces given that the e39 530i only weighs 275 pounds more than the e46 325i and has a longer wheel base 1114 vs 1073 a wider wheel track 595601 vs 579584 and wider sp tires 245 vs 225 i find myself wondering if the 325i isnt maybe even at a small disadvantage when compared to the 530i either way both cars are quite delightful in canyon carving mode  best regards\\nshipo negative stereotype is everyone driving a bimmer supposed to start feeling quilty now\\n3 series loose without sp i beg to differ to me the difference is very slight much less than the difference between the 3 and some of the v6 cars mentioned above sp cars look sharper though imo very guilty bmw drivers should turn in their cars and seek couseling immediately could we get the best available appt times and whatnotahead of the hummer guys good bye 330i performance package i must surrender my car and go banal with an automatic accord while im at it my filmgoing will switch to entirely mainstream big budget flicks and ill only buy books by bestselling authors no more good restuarant or quirky holeinthewall places as its entirely tasteless chain food now like mcdonalds outback and oliver garden obviously any concerts attended will now be for bands played ad nauseum on the radio too yes this looks like a wonderful life i have planned now im happy someone pointed out the accords just as good its reshaped my entire view of entertainment its too late for them the hummer guys should be committed however theres still hope for blueguydotcom   if all i wanted was the benchmark handling of the benchmark sports sedani would forego 1 if all i did was to test the 060 010014 mile top speed which the 3 series bests in at least two of the myriad of models and comes close in a model having 50 less hp and torque\\n2 if all i wanted was more size than a civic i would get an 8 seater\\n3 if all i wanted was dvda dts 51 keep it\\n4 if all i wanted was new lookdesign instead of the classier looks of a bmw\\n5 if all i wnted was more feature and amenities that dont add to the driving experience\\n6 if all i wanted was more horsepower that doesnt translate into a faster car\\n7 if all i wanted was more space on back seat i would get an excusrion\\n8 if all i wanted was sorry too many and i did designman the prices of the various 3 and 5 series sport packages are most reasonable rather inexpensive for what you get the premium packages tend to be more expensive so it isnt a question of cost but you are right about expectations if you want a serious sport sedan then you at least have to get the sport pkg or go perf pkg or go m if all you want is a decent car then prem pkg is what many do the bmw sport pkg is the real sleeper option too bad you cant get lsd to get lsd you have to go m not even perf pkg adds lsd people can disagree with opinion of others but number talks sorry if these numbers which i got from edmundnot cr doesnt make you happy but they talks i dont know about translating into a faster car but these number talks about power handling\\nslalom test 600 ft says it all if handling problem like understeeroversteer exist so much do you think tl can run 675 mph while 330i only 636 mph i know you would say something else like it doesnt have the special bmw feelings maybe the tester is crazy maybe the tester is driving under influenceacura tips better or maybe he doesnt even wear underpants15 grams lighter well who knows excuses excuses some people use some certain rules \\nrule 1  bmw is the best\\nrule 2  if the car is a little bit slower than other please look at rule 1\\nrule 3  if the car has less luxury features dont forget rule 1\\nrule 4  but dad every test stats says otherwise dont argue with me i am your dad\\nthen the kid say dad you forgot rule 1 i think its funny you need to go into all sorts of things to prove car a is better car b car a and car b are both fine vehicles but car b is the benchmark sorry if you dont like that conclusion by the collective automotive opinion its not my opinion its theirs actually you are a good debateraggresive you make this board alive im kinda addicted to this board debating is a healthy way to exercise our brain none of my statement are personals they are just fun thoughts and i still love bmw infinity lexus etc in their respective ways i agree with car b as the benchmark although sometimes the facts vary as in cr cd etc actually you are a good debater i appreciate that and you have put forth some compelling factsopinions as well i always enjoy trading posts as long as they are about the vehicles and the industry and not the vehicles owners i actually wish i could have one of each of the aforementioned vehicles in my driveway as they all have their strengths on the road a different driving experience if you will for different times there are times for example crawling to work at 10mph for an hour and a half the dvda really appeals to me but then for those rare times the roads are clear im very happy to be in my car feeling like the dang thing is on rails anticipating my every move while i am in pothole avoidance mode the tl has everything the 6speed for example is a premiumsport package with more horsepower faster slalom times and lsd for thousands less than a fully optioned 330 sport premium kitchen sink whatever car b is the benchmarkbut for how long car a for its bigger engine does not translate into faster 060 330 according to cd gets to 60 faster than the tl braking is superior as well i believe it also beat the tl in the 14 mile the m3 which is a 3series after all for the same size engine as the tl is another story altogether with its 47 060 the tl is a great sporty sedan if you dont mind a little torque steer the handling of the 330 is just better skidpad is better as well i doubt the tl will best the slalom of the zhp though with its m3 like handling so if all you want to do all day long is go around cones the tl is the car for you my thats great my fathers the same way about me getting my new car he wants me to get a bmw or a mb nothing else can compare he makes me lauph he cant even fit into the 3 series too tall cant get comfy but he wants me to get that or the mb c230 sedan also cant sit comfy go figure but there mb and bmw so nothing can beat them he makes me lauph he cant even fit into the 3 series too tall cant get comfy my fathers 61 and he had no problems getting comfy in the front seats go out and run 100 miles on a winding road in both cars and i think you would appreciate the 330 more fwd cars when driven hard over heat the front tires and start to push more and more the torque steer requires more driver effortattention to manage anyone who has raced fwd cars has to learn how to manage the tires and the inevitable mid race increase in push a rwd car takes a lot less effort to drive at speed and puts less load on the front tires as so many have pointed out already there is so much more to cars that what can be measured with 060 or a 600ft slalom course if you took 10 highly skilled drivers and asked them which car tl or 330 they would take for a little 2 hour race tl vs 330 i would be surprised if any of them choose the tl i raced fwd cars for 10 years and i know what car i would take try doing that in the dead of winter and see which car finishes first hows that paul simon song go slip sliding away the original working title of that song was rwd in february just a point that many seem to be unaware of regarding the bmw sport package it does make a difference i think but much more so on the 325i than the 330i the suspension on the 330i is the same regardless of whether you get the sport package or not it already has the upgraded suspension the only chassisrelated difference is wheels same 17 size though i think and of course bigger summer performance tires the 325i has a softer base suspension dont get me wrong  the bmw sport pkg seatsis great i had a 99 328i that i just traded in a few weeks ago im just saying that it probably doesnt transform the car as much as people are saying in the case of the 330i or the coupes which also come standard with the firmer suspension and anyone who has driven a 325i without the sport package and claims it isnt fun and still dynamically headandshoulders above most of the competition hasnt really driven one its still a great car before i get labeled as a blind bmwlover my new car is an infiniti g35x  loved my bmw but the value prop for the g was just too high to pass up try doing that in the dead of winter and see which car finishes first hows that paul simon song go slip sliding away the original working title of that song was rwd in february it has long seemed that when the fwd advocates run out of arguments about why their beloved fwd configuration is superior they always turn to how well their cars perform in snow hey yall had me fooled to the point where i left behind rwd cars in 1979 and didnt start driving them again until 1999 so ill start out with a few well chosen words regarding how much better fwd cars perform in snow vs rwd cars 1 assuming the assertion is in fact true who cares i mean how much snow do you really drive in anyway\\n2 sorry guys it just aint so according to a very interesting test run a couple of years back by one of the car magazines it is in fact true that under light acceleration the fwd car will perform better in snow than an otherwise similar rwd car unfortunately for the fwd crowd thats where the performance advantages end rwd cars with their naturally better balance ie foreaft weight distribution reigned supreme in the handling and braking department awd cars were a different story however the rwd cars with their lighter relative weight still stopped better after all who cares about getting going if you cannot stop or turn i am now driving a rwd car with a nearly perfect 5050 weight distribution traction control and winter tires and i can say without a doubt that it is the finest winter weather driving car i have ever driven given what chris bangle has done to bmw i have no idea what my next car will be however i can assure you that even though i live in snowy new hampshire it will be rwd best regards\\nshipo i admit sometimes i like to stir the pot in fact ive been a long time admirer of the 5series particularly the 540i 6speed but i dont think i could ever forgive bangle for what he did to it i think that you and i are singing from the same page of the song book regarding the visual disaster that is the new e60 5series oddly enough i actually like the new 6series specifically the 645ci however from a financial point of view college tuition for the kids and such im not too sure its in my future best regards\\nshipo 100 miles or 2 hours driving on a winding road\\nfrankly i cant find any in chicago unless in some deserted suburb maybe how about 100 miles or 2 hours drive on interstate highway i assume its more easy to find and i bet you know the outcome i love a car that run well under any condition not just snowy dry straight line or even on winding road some cars may just run well on certain kind of road but not all benchmark in serious sport sedans will always go to rwder atnear 5050 balance and manual transmission i6 and lsd big plus danny1878 and kdshapiro you both make great points with regard to debating in posts 749 and 750 but don146t forget the yucks humor is the flora of human emotion a world without humor is like a house without landscaping which reminds me i havent wisecracked in a while i was incredibly tempted to throw in some totally sophomoric quip about hummers but thought twice by the way when you talk about being addicted to these boards i find that one of the best things about the internet as part of it146s incredible significance to mankind is the catharsis that has come about with regard to the formerly lost art of letter writing this art is once again alive better than ever with an immediacy that was hardly imaginable not too long ago i always encourage the kids to play less with computer games read and write more often\\x85 the net has amazing education value somehow i146m thinking of my adolescence now there are black leather jackets pompadours cockroachkiller shoes with taps the beach boys and dreams of corvettes and pinging along with the screws that have come loose in my head is the wisdom of my fellow bronx denizens a philosophical variety that no doubt originated either there or in brooklyn it goes something like this\\x85 hey designman i got your catharsis\\x85 right here speedracer3 im wondering where i fit in with that bmw stereotype as a threecar owner ill definitely be crossshopping therapists  my dad would be fine if he was 61 but hes closer to 66 or 67 he finds it harder to fit into any car for that matter but its all in the eyes of the beholder anyways there are a lot of nice cars you just have to find the one that is right for you just look up your nearest bmw authorized therapist and remember there is life after the propeller 2004 estimated 3year resale values source alg 1 bmw 545\\n2 lexus 532\\n3 acura 521\\n4 mb 52\\n5 audi 512\\n6 infiniti 511 i got a question if the average bmw sells for 95 of msrp and the average infiniti sells for 90 of msrp arent real world resale values approximately the same 51190  54595  57 jrock65 those are purely guestimates the actual numbers wont be know for years when real owners go to sell their cars or trade them in the industry has done a horrible job projecting depreciation which impacts both leases and nonlease purchases for the past decade or more trend had been to inflate plus manufacturers sometimes artificially inflate residual in order to subsidize the lease then they take a bath 3 years down road when their dealers are wholesaling the lease returns realized depreciation really best applies to the person who buys the car new and then sells it later their actual realized depreciation is the difference between what they actually paid which is usually below msrp and what they actual get for resale which is usually below the published books msrp is normally meaningless to depreciation unless that is the price paid at time of purchase yes these are estimates but i dont believe that theyre worthless if im buying a car now theres no way to know for sure what itll sell for in the future these estimates do serve as some sort of guide however imperfect they are the tense of my question should be in the future tense guess it really depends on whether you plan on leasing or buying and how long you plan on keeping the car these guestimates wont matter a whit if you buy the car outright keep it for a decade and drive the wheels off of it nor will they matter if you are leasing and get a great subsidized lease deal from the manufacturer where they deliberately overestimate residuals in order to lower less payment of course these estimates do matter when it comes to calculating a lease deal today but ive never leased and cant imagine ever doing so but i also think these estimates can be dangerous for people who buy and then plan on trading in or selling off their car in say 25 years these numbers are almost always over what you will actually receive from a dealer or private party to be safe deduct at least an extra 10 if not more like 25 give you an example on 113001 i bought a cpo 98 540i6 had about 52k miles original msrp was around 58k i paid about 36k i traded her in 903 at about 78k miles got about 19k from dealer so my actual depreciation for the 22 months and 26k miles i owned her was about 17k the dealer who bought it from me sold it for about 22k so the car at 78k miles5 years was worth a bit over a 13 what she went for newactually paid in 98\\n  im a writer working on a story for acura style the magazine that is sent to all acura owners id like to talk to early buyers of the new aspec package for the tl if youve bought one and are willing to tell me what you think of it will you send me an email at jennielpaolcom thanks jennie phipps according to aol autos 1 bmw 5 series\\n2 mercedes e55 amg\\n3 audi s4\\n4 infiniti g35\\n5 evo the information source for these vehicles is edmunds of course its all covered one end to the other are you kidding mei dont trust aol as an internet provider and much less as a source for car reviews theres some reasonableness to that survey the 5 has always been on top and the its a true lux car the amg deserves its high spot all the way what price range are we talking the m5 runs 70000 how much is an e55 amg the g35 starts at under 30000 so the entire 5series gets top honors but then they split hairs down the rest of the list why just the s4 and not the a4 why just the e55 amg why just the evo and not the lancer series if splitting up the production line why not just the m5 at the top of the list and sorry but you cant tell me a 525 auto with stock suspension is better than an e55 amg i read this from another forum you just need to read the numbers to figure out what cd is about i remember the comparo between the cls and the 330i that you mention in fact you can find it online curiously the 330i seemed to jump nearly 15 seconds faster to 60 58 vs 73 than when they tested it alone it also ripped through the 14 in an astonishing 144 seconds i say astonishing because in the same issue they list it in the roadtest digest as needing a whole 156 seconds which is much more in line with every other place ive seen it tested then they didnt even question this remarkable improvement they go on to say that the 330i beats the cls due to its performance advantage but when you look at the numbers they give the cls a better rating for the engine a better rating for the transmission and an equal rating for handling then they give the cls a 7 for styling while giving the bmw a 10  and so the cls loses by 1 point styling is purely subjective cls acura cl type s that cant be it as the 330i is a sedan confused story is titled hobsons choice value versus charisma go figure overall rating was 40628 330ci 97 and 33180 cl types 96 however the sum of the 12 individual pointed categories favored the 330ci by 4 points styling advantage to 330ci by 3 points cls won 4 engine transmission ergonomics and value they tied in 3 handling ride fitfinish 330ci won 5 brakes driver comfort featuresamenities styling and fun to drive keep in mind this cl types had a 6speed manual vs the bmws 5speeds and lsd not available on nonm 3s as they put it the lsd produces an amazing transformation that conceals any suggestion that it is a frontdriver 060 mph 330ci 58 secs cls 59\\n0100 mph cls 152 secs 330ci 155\\n14 mile 330ci 144s97mph cls

than this test report i couldnt convince anyone ive helped buy a car to ever drive a cl i thought they were a nice bargain for the content every person i took to see one would exclaim something about buicks or other bland vehicles shrug yeah they were vanillabut they had nice engines say what you will about the wrx and evo at least they evoke a response ugly garish just something that calls forth more than someone making references to dead gm companies sorry about the confusion\\nmy point is taste style fun are purely subjective cls is only 1 point behind those rating by cd seems useless heres the jan sales table for bmw httpwww2autospiescomarticleindexasparticleid2593 3 went down 25 g35  tl both went sharply up 3 might need upgrade to fend off young guns whats with z4 went down 75 in one year z4 is a flat out bomb bangle will be bmws undoing if hes allowed to continue to contribute his design philosophy as for 3 sales off 25ouch my guess is bmw needs to sweeten the pie and do something about prices 3537k for a 325i is silly when one can buy a g35 with the same equipment and more performance for 32k bmw needs to wake up and do something about the value proposition they dont have one mariner7 you have to keep in mind the impact of suvs just look at lexus they sold a bit over 250000 cars last year about 52 were suvs their sales of cars plummetted esp cars like sc430 and is300 the gx470 suv had huge growth the rx330 is the big seller something like 92000 units in less than 5 years lexus suvs went from about 0 to over 50 of sales huge reason bmw is pushing x3 and x5 bmw reportedly seriously looking into some minivanlike suv which they give a fancy sounding use designation riez good points but thats just toyota with bad cars in thier lineup suv popularity is falling and cars are in again with overall industry trends moving away from suvs that may be short lived if the rx hybrid and others take the world by storm like minivans did in the 80s i cant think of a single reason not to buy a suv that gets 35mpg and is faster than a gasoline only counterpartfor the same money heres a quote from another automotive website that was posted a couple of weeks ago on the all new 2005 acura rl weve learned that acura will not only go against conventional wisdom and not make a rwd 8 cylinder car but create a new revolution with the first 300hp 6cylinder hybrid engine wow imagine no performance compromise and 40mpg forget the prius this will be the car to own if these rumors are true the car will be shown to dealers at their meeting in august and be available in the octobernovember time frame some reasons are they look ridiculous and too many people have them a van is much more practical and useful vehicle thats why i mentioned both g35  tl went up in jan if anything i was expecting tl to take bite out of g because both are japanese at least so far thats not happening because g sales went way up does anyone have numbers for c and a4 i dont expect c to be as affected because its not perceived as performance machine like 3gtl tl is brand new so hard to see trends g35 just added the awd version that should boost sales in winter bmw mb vw and porsche are living proof that suvs are in their futures just check out porsche sales cars and suvs notice how many suvs coming out or have come out from these marques heck even porsche is bringing out a v6 cayenne priced in the low 40000s and they expect it to account for 13 of cayenne sales marques like jaguar and audi hurting for lack of product in this area saab is even going to the subarupart of gm to get their new 92 and 97 and you dont think suvs are where almost all the action has been is and will be for some time hi all\\ni have been a very very happy driver of a 2001 330i  from the very first batch harman kardan and power seats were options then  i got the hk but kept the manual seats i have been driving it through my 4th winter now and never had problem so far even with the performance tires however there is one thing i have noticed especially when the winters are colder below 30f the service engine soon light comes on and stays on when the temp goes to upper 30s the light comes on when i start the car but goes off after a few minutes i talked to the bmw service guy and he asked me to check if the gas cap is loose which surprised me and it wasnt\\nhas anyone seen the same problem with the 330is\\ni am getting concerned now since its been this way a while now thanks in advance\\nsolomon movva you should post this issue on the bmw 3series owners problems  solutions board re suvs and sales all true for audi bmw and jaguar but not mercedes mercedes does the impossible by posting all of their sales gains on their car almost across the board the c e s and clk were up 31 307 86 and 115 percent respectively for 2003 vs 2002 if only theyd get the suv thing right m which site regularly posts monthly sales figures for mb usa thanks i cant post the link edmunds rules but its germancarfanscom mbusacom used to do it monthly but theyve gotten incredibly lazy as of late no press releases from jul to dec m if you add up x5  x3 sales they stayed about flat so suv sales didnt take away from 3 sales the fact is tl just had the best sales month in history in jan and this is the 3rd gen tl for a time it was the best selling entry luxury car and the new one got the record right out of the gate id call that a trend and an exceptionally good start g35 in two years it only went from nothing to rivalling 3 as the best selling rwd car on the market mariner7 my only points are 1 suvs have become a clear trend even in premium marques like bmw and lexus 2 there can be intramarque sales competition eg the x3 and 3 series take sales from each other as do the rx330 and es330 3 there is intermarque competiton potential buyers who didnt like the new 7 series might go for the s class or people who think the 330i is too expensive might buy a g35 and 4 you have to take into account general economic and social trends eg in general recessions cause sales to fall and buyers have moved away from sedans and station wagons into suvs and light trucks all four factors must be evaluated when comparing a particular marques sales over time as well as a specific model within that marque over time i am looking forward to driving the new volvo s40 t5 the car looks great and if it delivers as advertized it could join this group of sport sedans in a hurry it will join the mazda 6 93 and smaller sedans but the 40 will not be in the same class as a 3 series or a g based in size alone the mazda 6 is bigger than the 3series and the new s40 is almost identical to the 3series ill just list the outside measurements to start but the inside matches up as well 330i\\n176l x 685w x 557h m6\\n1868l x 701w x 567h s40\\n1759l x 697w x 572h wow  they repositioned the carwhat happened to the 60 the 60 was barely recognized in the class so this could be good for volvo the old 40 was a joke for even volvo fans the mazda 6 is big as a 3 but the 3 is small the 3 is in the entry lux category and smaller than a passat but the passat nor the 6 will ever be in the same class as 3 so will the 40 be entry lux is the question i have  are the statements simply conjecture this new s40 shares platforms with the mazda3ford focus the cream of the crop will be the t5 with awd can anyone reccomend a site for sales figures auto site posts sales figures but are very slow to post is there any other source below is a website with interior and exterior photos of the 2005 infiniti m35\\ni have a 2000 i30 and was hoping that infiniti would come out with a car larger that the g35 to replace the i series while i like the g35 i was looking for something a little bigger and more near luxury than sporty i hope they have one at the ny auto show in april httpthehollywoodextracominfinitiinfinitihtml boy they sure hit the back portions of the g35 wagon with the ugly stick oh my they cant be serious the m35 looksinteresting   omg oh no its a bird oh no its a plane oops its a coffin lets hope that the car has a cloaking device installed anything you see on hollywood extra is utter bunk some guy set up that site years ago and hes been wandering around since posting doctored photos and such as insider info its bunk move on g35 coupe outsold 325ci  325ci convertible  330ci  330ci convertible by 2100 to 1500 in january 04 however i assume that january is not a popular month for convertible sales any word as to whether nissan will build a g35 convertible yeah they increased the interior size on the 40 quite a bit they say its almost as roomy as the 60 now id imagine that means a redesign of the 60 to increase that size then the 80 well see at the price the 40 is coming in at and based on the ammenities id have to say its definitely in the entrylux class the base model starts at 24190 and the t5 starts at 26990 and gets into the mid30s for the fwd model awd info is not yet available i heard rumours new 3 will increase in size makes sense to move up so 1 can move in are the 1s just hatch or will there be sedans and coupes so a madza 3 is as big as a bmw 3 and the 40 is now a entry lux sports sedan at 24k i think there should be some consistency in the classes so i am not so confused 1 series is supposed to offer a sedan coupe and convertible eventually and nissan better make a g35 convertible a car that sexy must be topless they do its called the z roadster not sure theres enough volume for two competing models i read on nissan enthusiast forum that infiniti dealers want a product to compete with mb sl and lexus sc way up market they also want a smaller suv to compete with x3 a murano is about the same a the x3 in price and size  i hope they dont rebadge that with infiniti labels question if the mazda 3 platformed s40 is a entry luz sedan what it the mazda 6 nothing from mazda is considered luxury look at it like a nissan maxima vs an infinity g35 one is considered luxo and the other not they do have that already is called the fx 3545 based on same platform wrong the fx 3545 is based on the z platform fm and not the murano which is based on the underwhelming altima platform what gm platforms is the saab 93 related to couldnt remember if it is the new cavalier or the new malibu platform sharing has gotten out of hand malibuembarassing to the saabys to say the least the fm 350z platfrom should be sold to all manufacturers so thier cars are actually worth all that money they do its called the z roadster not sure theres enough volume for two competing models \\nthats ludicrous the g35 ragtop would compete with the 330cic the 350 roadster doesnt really compete for the same buyers as the 330cic 350z is performance and performance and wind the g35 would go after the hearts and wallets of people who want luxury and performance a g coupe would look great topless  maybe alot like the z tho the sedan would look like canoe with out a top tho audi and bmw make it hard to compete in the convertible niche market for sedans how many 3 sales are convertible as a  of all 3 sales its gotta be hard to make any money saabys arent phased we embrace the malibu as many of us live there d here is another platform sharer some quotes from wwwcarkeyscouk road test\\nsubaru legacy 30rn\\n \\nno longer an outcast\\nby ross finlay 10 nov 03 in previous years subarus suggestion that with the latest legacy its targeting the leading prestige european marques would have seemed like pr spin from cloud cuckoo land but since the 2004 model range offers smoothedout exterior styling greatly improved interior presentation a more powerful topoftherange engine and even more precise handling youd better believe it subaru may not be the class of the field when it comes to premium badge recognition but the lighterweight 2004 model which goes on sale this month sits even more foursquare on the road thanks to its wider track modified suspension and lowered powertrain together with revisions to the steering and brakes lower front and rear roll centres and the advantage of fourwheel drive all this means that the toprated 30r feels to have similarly priced european saloons and estates beaten handsdown for handling i cant think of any immediate competitors at prices in the mid20000 to 30000 range which could match them for poise and traction on winding or hilly roads the threelitre legacy is the bestbalanced car in its class driven briskly its stable and precise on corners and theres no need to throw it about rather than hold it on line out on the open road anybody who feels the vdc cutting in  unless during an emergency attempt to miss the tractor  ought to blush at being so hamhanded as i said before if you have driven a legacy you know you dont have to worry about keeping up with audis bmws g35s or tls in the twisties the 30r might be getting the 6spd mt from the sti according to subdrivencom audi and bmw make it hard to compete in the convertible niche market for sedans how many 3 sales are convertible as a  of all 3 sales its gotta be hard to make any money audi rofl audis a4 cab is a joke its straight up not a sports sedancoupe bmw is the only player in the entry level sports coupe convertible market with everything from the underpowered 325cic to the monsterous m3 convertible they have the market to themselves ill be amazed if infiniti doesnt show off a g convertible for the 2005 my its a no brainer given the way the g sells vis a vis the 3 btw if youve seen any artist conceptions of a g35 convertible it looks nothing like a canoe see the impotent solara convertible for that audi rofl audis a4 cab is a joke its straight up not a sports sedancoupe the a4 cab is a beautiful car and it is more of a cruiser i think if i wanted something more sporty from audi id look for something called the tt the audi is probably cross shopped by 3cic buyers as they are really prob more lux conscience than performance conscience a super sprty sedan or coupe is compromised by the top being gone so there is an oxy moron factor there that suggests that these buyers arent that into performance in the first place if you want to scoot around quickly in style with some rigitidy the a4 will work pretty well id think what are a4 cabrio sales the a4 cab is a beautiful car and it is more of a cruiser i think if i wanted something more sporty from audi id look for something called the tt youd end up with a 2 seat car again thats not competition for the 330cic and for the dough its not nearly as nice of a car a super sprty sedan or coupe is compromised by the top being gone so the compromise is slight if the engineering is solid were talking a marginal weight penalty and if the engineers designed it as a convertible from the start then the chassis flex is not that much of a difference 1020 years ago this wasnt true today many sports cars are made from the ground up as convertibles  z8 viper etc there is an oxy moron factor there that suggests that these buyers arent that into performance in the first place if you want to scoot around quickly in style with some rigitidy the a4 will work pretty well id think have you seen the times on that bloated cow its a 4k lbs beast with an underwhelming engine nobody is seriously challenging bmws dominance of 4 place entry lux rwd convertibles we know buyers are grabbing up g35 coupes and sedans so a convertible is the next sensible step in infinitis quest to steal bmws thunder weird im the bmw owner here and you guys seem to think its a bad idea for infiniti to offer a rwd convertible 4 place sports coupe btwi would hardly call the upcoming s4 cabrio a joke its probably in m3 territory httpwwwedmundscomnewsautoshowsarticles100537page021htm l i still would call it a joke even with that v8 the pig will take over 6 seconds to reach 60 using a manual ouch thats pretty sad for a car sporting 340 hp then again the slothlike pace of the standard s4 is nothing to sing about thats the kind of pig ill take anyday according to edmunds both s4s cabrio and sedan can get 60 in the 5s range cd tested the sedan at 5 seconds flat httpwwwcaranddrivercomarticleaspsection_id33article _id7574 i hardly call that a pig the m3 hits 60 in about 5 secs and it has a weight advantage whos oinking ya know there is a little company called mercedesbenz that makes 4seat 2door rwd convertibles im not saying which is better and that can be debated all day long but its not like bmw is the only company making these things and you do know that the standard s4 does 060 in 5 seconds flat cd while providing awd right the m3 tested by cd was only 210ths quicker oh but they picked the s4 over the m3 ya know there is a little company called mercedesbenz that makes 4seat 2door rwd convertibles im not saying which is better and that can be debated all day long but its not like bmw is the only company making these things what mb 4 seat rwd convertible starts at under 50k or 40k there isnt one nuff said there the clk is an entirely different class of car again no entry level lux 4 seat rwd convertibles challenge the bimmer the a4 is trying to good for them still think infiniti would score a bullseye with a g35 convertible why are you all opposed to this if infiniti releases a 40k g35 spyder its gonna be a serious competitor to the 3 series lexus has stated they will have an is in the next gen thats a coupe and a convertible they know its important and you do know that the standard s4 does 060 in 5 seconds flat cd while providing awd right as tested ive seen mostly mid 5s from the s4 even 5 seconds flat is rather unspectacular given the torque of a v8 and the power output typical vw porky still think infiniti would score a bullseye with a g35 convertible why are you all opposed to this if infiniti releases a 40k g35 spyder its gonna be a serious competitor to the 3 series i think most of the board are hard toppers  i know i am i never will ever buy a convertible it just goes against my every fiber if i did live in fla again or ca for sure i would get a jeep cj7 and throw the doors awaythats a convertible to me anyway i guess if infniti can sell some convertibles they should do it but thier lineup is being revamped and the rescources may not be there with all the new products they developed as long as they look good and they dont flex like a lebaron ragtop im for itjust not in my driveway that could be it ive grown up with convertibles and when i bought my daily commuter i seriously considered snatching up a 99 miata as i could get it cheap and mod it to my hearts content i ended up going safe with my choice but as soon as february rolls around i begin to pine for the sun for the next few years i have to settle for dropping the windows and opening the moonroof or borrowing my families convertibles bmw sold almost the exact same number of 3 series coupes as its 3 series convertibles in the cold month of january so i would say that there definitely is a viable market for the g35 convertible i for one wouldnt mind seeing a g35 convertible its not porky it just has awd the awd system does add weight and causes driveline loss regardless the s4 compares well to the m3 not going to slit hairs over fractions of seconds even better you can get the s4 in a sedan which gives you all the convenience of 4 doors with the power of a sports car i would get an s4 sedan over a m3 in a heartbeat better yet give an rs4 which would chew a m3 and spit it out noticed in the latest issue of autoweek 21604 there is a small news flash article titled droptop camry solara convertible that comes out in march designed from the ground up as a convertible fwd 225hp 33l v6 with 5speed automatic toyota must see some value in 2door convertible market too bad no manual transmission maybe there will be an is300 convertible lexus has stated that there will be a coupe convertible and awd variant of the next model is300 lets see if they follow through jrock65 i dont believe everything i read i have doubts that lexus will actually build an is300 convertible rather small niche market to begin with let alone to try and recover development costs will be interesting to see if the solara convertible sells well if it does maybe lexus will create the is300 convertible lexus hasnt had too much luck selling convertiblesroadsters neither has infiniti anyone remember the m30 convertible dont think acura has even tried the majority of sales will still be sedans in this segment the majority of sales will still be sedans in this segment true but bmws got so much of the market expressly because theyre not only selling sedans theyve got a diverse 3 series line up and thw 1 is going to be the same way in fact i read recently that they plan to have a 200 hp  version of the 1 if its convertible and under 40k i have good feeling that will replace my little too thick 3 series btw someone said theyd take an s4 or some such variant to each his own ill never own another vw i actually hope that company goes out of business ill never own another vw i actually hope that company goes out of business  ouch m what mb 4 seat rwd convertible starts at under 50k or 40k sorry i misunderstood and didnt realize the requirements were rwd 4seat nearluxo under 40k but youre right if you want a luxo car with vinyl seats and less than 200 hp you can find a convertible bmw with a sticker a hair under 40k as tested ive seen mostly mid 5s from the s4 even 5 seconds flat is rather unspectacular given the torque of a v8 and the power output typical vw porky in their comparison test cd could get the m3 to 60 mph only 2tenths of a second quicker than the s4 personally id make that sacrifice to save 1500 get 2 more doors and add awd oh and cd also had this to say\\nyou must work the sixspeed to stay ahead however as shown by the topgear 30to50 and 50to70 bursts where the largerdisplacement audi had a significant advantage and\\nof this trio the s4 is in a class by itself scoring the full 10 points in our handling rating two above the m3 and three above the c32 not bad for the porky car i sense a lot of bitterness towards vwaudi just because you had a bad experience doesnt mean that they are bad cars i had a lot of problems with bmws but i dont think they bad cars 060 is the derigueur standard for performance but is it really the stat that you need to know on how a car performs in traffic how many people drop the clutch on there 3540k  cars yea i know somme of the knuckle heads on these boards but not normal drivers  i think the speed bursts and rollon power stats is what is most telling the 3050 mph 5070 mph bursts and 60130 rollon power is gonna tell you alot about the car anyone want to show the comparable 5070 or 60130 stats for our favorite class someone must have database for all these stats by one tester and these are the definitive mag racer stats for sure imo i would predict the tl would win a 060 by 24 secs and then get walked by 5 seconds or so 60130 the latest car and driver has a 35000 comparison test that fits the bill nicely here are the stats in order 060 14 mile 560 top gear 3050 top gear 5070 tl  58 145 65 114 111\\na4 3l  75 158 75 101 92\\n325i  70 154 80 87 91\\ng35  63 146 70 93 88\\nis300  73 155 78 86 83\\n93 arc  72 154 78 153 95 and for good measure because i carealso from cd tsx  72 156 77 102 97 i think the 560 street start is a good test because it eliminates different tire traction and launch techniques from the equation i think the 14 mile is a good test because it mitigates the different gear ratios which distort the 060 test the tsx needs 3rd gear to reach 60 mph and lets both hp and tq come into play i dont like the top gear tests because 5speed cars have a 100 ratio while the 6speed cars have a much taller ratio the saab has 62 in 6th gear and 75 in 5th overall though i guess its a good picture of the strengths and weaknesses of each car i sense a lot of bitterness towards vwaudi just because you had a bad experience doesnt mean that they are bad cars i had a lot of problems with bmws but i dont think they bad cars i neednt carry the burden alone the stats speak loudly on the quality of vwaudi products fed nice post although i question the usefulness of tests that do top gear 5070 what sort of a person with a performance car would want to do something like that honestly if im doing 50 im not going to be in anything higher than 4th and most likely in 3rd if youve got a six speed manual g35 or tl its expressly because you like to row your own gears i think a test that shows 5070 and 3050 isnt this just second gear from the optimum gear would tell us more about the cars owners quickly figure out how to squeeze the fun from their engines cant even imagine touching 6th gear on my car before 80 mph and then its only if im going to go to cruise and basically sleep fedlawman you wrote i dont like the top gear tests because 5speed cars have a 100 ratio while the 6speed cars have a much taller ratio the saab has 62 in 6th gear and 75 in 5th most 5speed manuals are also overdrive the is300 is overdrive the is300s overdrive just isnt very deep believe it is around 85 there are some exceptions bmw tends to use a nonoverdrive 5th gear in their close ratio boxes but has also used an overdrive in their wide ratio boxes you also have to factor in the differentials final drive ratio the higher the number the quicker the acceleration but the lower the top speed the wonders of engine torque multiplication the value of the top gear data is in regard to showing whether youll have to downshift in order to pass the cars with the real deep overdrives say 70 or lower numerically normally will have to downshift to 5th or even 4th top gear test also is somewhat indicative of how much torque the engine produces in its power band you might also compare cds observed and epa estimated fuel economy numbers holding all other factors constant the cars with the deepest overdrives will normally get the best fuel economy and turn over the lowest engine revs at high speeds for relaxed high speed cruising the former acura tl types a great example believe it used a 411 final drive and a 47 5th gear overdrive great initial acceleration and great fuel economy tsx runs better than the saab id rather have it and the is300 looks better in top gear stats as its a 5 speed i believe cd published the gear and final drive ratios too1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th final tl  393 248 170 125 098 077 329\\na4  350 189 132 103 086 073 411\\n325  423 252 166 122 100 na 315\\ng35  379 232 162 127 100 079 354\\nis  357 206 138 100 085 na 373\\n93  377 204 132 095 075 062 391\\ntsx  327 188 136 103 083 066 476 from acura brochure without 6th gear the 3050 and 5070 numbers for the sub30l cars would all be within a couple 110ths of each other hence the similar 14 mile times the value of the top gear data is in regard to showing whether youll have to downshift in order to pass need to need i dont want to take 7 or even 5 seconds to go from 50 to 70 i want to change gears i want to use the power of my car i bought a six speed manual for a reason  to exploit the power of the car if im stuck behind some tool doing 50 i look forward to dropping to third and rocketing by the guy theres nothing troublesome about that as thats why i bought a car with this much power and a manual the cars with the real deep overdrives say 70 or lower numerically normally will have to downshift to 5th or even 4th ill take third thanks i can pull to almost 100 in 3rd so at 60 the car rockets top gear test also is somewhat indicative of how much torque the engine produces in its power band at 50 mph in 6th id be turning somewhere near 2k rpm who drives a car sporting a 7k redline with the engine down there tsx runs better than the saab id rather have it and the is300 looks better in top gear stats as its a 5 speed i believe thats part of the reason the test is bogus ive driven both cars and the tsxs 6 speed is like butter moving to 3rd from 6th is a pleasure and allows the driver to exploit the tsxs spritely little 4 superb engine and tranny tsx to me is a better deal than tl for sure if only i were younger smaller and not in traffic if they had one in 1993 i would have jumped on it although i have not had much luck with acurahonda cars and trannys as i am way too demanding on their little motors ancd beat the tar out of them i get the sense the tsx would be up to the task and is a little more than the rsx in capability and fun factor blueguydotcom is more of a european thing bmws mbs etc often used closeratio nonoverdrive 4th or 5th gears to ensure adequate response in all gears i dont mind downshifting to pass and id rather have better highway fuel economy but i will admit it is nice to be driving my 04 is300 manual in 5th gear and come upon a slower car i can immediately pass without having to shift did same with my former 98 540i6 believe it had only a 82 6th overdrive i have no issues passing a doof going 40 in a 70 in top gear in the g but like blueguy me thinks its funner downshifting to 3rd my philosophy is why not hammer the motor  its the one thing that prob will last the longest and you can have more fun too if when i pass i can get down another gear  why not i have a hard time not enjoying all the acceleration this babys got if there is any reason to downshift i cant help it  i am addicted to feeling the thrust amen yeah we can all press the pedal and build up but we bought performance sports sedans so we could get that giddy jump from 5080 or even 80100 in a flash someone mentioned germany and gear ratios for 5th ah those are for autobahn speeds im sure 5th and 6th pull like monsters in my zhp of course ive never been travelling at 120 to prove that anyone see the scathing edmunds article on the bmw 530i full test 55k and no nav for a idrive underpowered unimproved bangle mobile the 545 will be way too much when the ctsv takes the world over 400hp and the dealer is only half mile from my house51k i hearhmmmmm funny thing about bmw cars ive been hearing about the newsoon to be released fill in the blank and how it was a sure thing to put the hurt on bmw hmmm so far anyway its all been noise speaking strictly for myself the new 5series is one of the ugliest cars on the road note i said one of the ugliest not the ugliest from my perspective the cts is even further down that road and as such there is no way i would own either of them even if they had 1000 hp and cost 15k looked at another way if i were to have opted for the e39 540i instead of my 530i which really is fast enough i would be quite happy with the wonderful performance and driving dynamics regardless of how many folks were out there driving ctsvs their drivers might well be laughing at me because of my slow 540i however i would be laughing right back at folks driving such hideous looking cars so whos right neither and both whatever floats your boat in the end i seriously doubt that cadillac is going to do much to bmw sales besides with the new banglized cars they are doing more to hurt themselves than the rest of the competition combined  best regards\\nshipo the 545 will be way too much when the ctsv takes the world over 400hp and the dealer is only half mile from my house51k i hearhmmmmm ctsv made by whom oh caddy have you driven a cts it drives like a caddy the manual was a laugh the front end plow on corners would have been funny had it not been scary with that softly sprung suspension caddylol to each his own according to all sources at this point the ctsv has nothing in common with the cts when it comes to performance i was in one for about 10 minutes when i bought a sedan and was not impressed with the 32 it was obviously not my first choice but a corvette motor and handling better than anything else for 50k including m3  im making the appointment now to see if its worth itlets be clear i am not a buyer of any car at the moment just want see if its worth it based on reports of those whove driven the v its a bad mutha i doubt it will steal much thunder from bmw as well but the 55k should get you a v8  that bmw premium is not worth it imo for weak performance the ctsv doesnt improve on the ctss biggest handicapits fugly inside and out its all subjectiveits not that much different than the g35  in fact it looks tighter sometimes it will sell and some will like it alot most toyotas are ugly but they sell like mad maybe they are only ugly to me i think ill pick this baby up insteadits faster than anything on the road anyway and my comute could finally be a breeze

issue with vwaudi seems thats grown to include perspective and current buyers httpthecarconnectioncomindexasparticle6866sid173am pn156 quality problems are still dogging vw vehicles and putting off customers who were attracted to vw in the late 1990s costing vw big on warranty repairs and marketing costs to keep old customers and lure new ones last year for example vw began offering costly leasepullahead deals to owners in order to keep them from defecting in europe the company is offering deals like free air conditioning to move a large inventory of golfs and similar measures are anticipated in north america vw stock initially rose 27 percent wednesday but then gave ground and closed at 3933 euros 5049 or less than one percent in frankfurt shares are down 11 percent since early january vw is offering discounted finance rates and leases in north america but has stayed away from big rebates most models have rebates of just 500 and it is facing pressure from dealers to be more generous on discounts to move aging models like the new beetle five years old golf and jetta six years old and passat five years old vws discounts are more in line with japanese and european imports than with us automakers but it doesnt have the premium image of its european mates nor the highreliability image of its asian rivals theres an article in business week about infiniti they say bmw has an enviable reputation of style performance  youthful vitality susan jacobs a well known auto analyst says that of all the other premium brands infiniti is in the best position to match bmw reputation and lexus   they may exceed them from a customer service plus reliability standpointnotwithstanding the actual lexus dynamics they have had it right since day 1 how else can they command a premium like that infiniti has alot going for it with upgraded gs gtrs and m45s comingmeanwhile the 5 series got worse and costs morethat repuation will only last so longmercedes found out i said bmws rep rests on style performance and ability to attract young buyers pardon me but i dont think lexus is well known for any of those things notwithstanding the actual lexus dynamics they have had it right since day 1 other than the is300 i cannot think of a single lexus model that isnt ummm well undynamic oh wait i liked the giorgetto giugiaroitaldesign studio incarnation of the 19931997 gs300 as well best regards\\nshipo blue nobody said vw doesnt have quality issues they do but i dont think their product is as bad as you are making it out to be vw has an older product line and they are not discounting their cars and that is why they are being taken to the cleaners by the american and japanese manufacturers i was very familiar with vwaudi products way before i owned one i hang out at vwvortex a lot i chose audi because they are better made and more reliable than their vw counterparts so far ive had a terrific ownership experience with my a4 sorry to hear that you had a bad experience i said bmws rep rests on style performance and ability to attract young buyers pardon me but i dont think lexus is well known for any of those things  differnt values at each co i agree but the new gs and the new is will change that as well as the cool hybrids and lx470 trucks that youger blingers want style is subjective they sell em without a discount so the ugly aspect isnt there if objectively speakingand performance will change in fact those cos that put hybrid front drives with gas rear drives in the same car will outperfrom everyone im not convinced infiniti has gotten lexus credibility just yet  they just found a young buyers niche only 2 years agothose werent young people in those qs and is that i saw over the last decademaybe g20 and then most young people went right to the sentra and saved 15k meanwhile the 5 series got worse and costs morethat repuation will only last so longmercedes found out got worse based on what is this claimed the edmunds review bashes them at times but overall they still find the car more fun to drive than its counterparts two of their complaints i cant get my head around idrive and lack of nav idrive is a snap to use in the 745i yes ive driven them and used it without a problem and the new version in the 5 is even more simplistic push a direction for a controloops wrong way its down for x control now you know problem solved as for the navi thingwhatever its a fairly useless toy but then again like idrive i like to explore and discover things on my own you can read what they say at current business week which is not online yet i believe point is generally speaking meaning not everyone agrees people in the auto media believe infiniti cars are more appealing to the crowd who find bmw appealing both have strengths in style performance and youthful appeal now i know some lexus fans believe lexus is best at everything i dont believe for even a second got worse based on what is this claimed the edmunds review bashes them at times but overall they still find the car more fun to drive than its counterparts the driving experience is the same apparently  all good but the downgraded look plus the money they wantnot so sure the market will accept the 5 for that money in 3 yearsmaybe now but the last 5 may have been the holy grail and may never be reproduced in terms of success i think the editor thought it would at least drive differently and better the a6 for 05 should be an interesting attempt to best the 5  well see and navs are the worst for a car  why o why should a car with 250 bucks in hardware be worth another 2k  ill never know point is generally speaking meaning not everyone agrees people in the auto media believe infiniti cars are more appealing to the crowd who find bmw appealing both have strengths in style performance and youthful appeal i think the nissan corp has had this one down for a while actually recanting here and capitalizes on what honda and toyota seem to neglect  style and inexpensive performance at least with the z car and the maxima i think the nissan corp has had this one down for a while actually recanting here and capitalizes on what honda and toyota seem to neglect  style and inexpensive performance at least with the z car and the maxima too bad the maxima is no longer inexpensive for its size  its not bad  its wwd tho compared to what i got my 2k maxima se for the 6th gen maxima is a ripoff imo they killed the car the g35 is what the 6th gen maxima should have been ive pointed out the cheap hardware for a navi before and how its a ripoffpeople get angry i cant get my head around how nav systems cost 2k 5 years ago and now dvd players are dirt cheap the gps software is ubiquitous the interface is arcane and the lcd is under 100 yet the price hasnt dropped at all id even be willing to believe a 500 price tag but 2k the tech stuff has the huge margins and if people want it they will pay i guess it sets cars apart for now  tekkie and cool i guess for those who need it or want cool stuff that wont really make the car better  like bluetooth and 51  bragging rights for technology are bigger than the car in some forums if you want high tech a prius is the way to go imo chris i admit the 51 intrigues me on the tl but then again i loathe the stereo in my bmw which isnt half bad when compared to the tinny garbage in my protege it sounds good as long as its a 51 cd in the player  but other than the 1 they give you at the dealer  youd be listening to regular cds which when played put the stereo on par with the g bose system  not bad but not exactly better by any margin than what everyone else offers for 200240 watts for those of you with the upgraded bose in a g the tweeters suck and when replaced with polk exs for 50 and half hour the sound system becomes alive and the imaging is much better the effectively drops the crossover from 8k to 4k and makes for much better highs with that thumping bass in the sedan anyway ps i should have bought best buy stock on the ipo  those electronic gadgets get a huge markup and just the few that have to be first to get something new support the lower prices later on for me this desire transcends into car options and premiums paid for them what would people pay for the tl no blutooth or 51 less since they wont have bragging rights tek nuts hate me  i still have windows 98 and a glass tube tv it is no wonder that the es330 sells so well even though not many people seem to be enthralled with its exterior styling with the impending death of the i35 and the new tls emphasis on sport it is basically the only import choice that emphasizes ride quality over handling in this price category and the general population which is statistically not well represented by the regulars here or the car magazines seems to prioritize ride quality over handling the es330s gorgeous interior doesnt hurt it either and the general population which is statistically not well represented by the regulars here or the car magazines seems to prioritize ride quality over handling the es330s gorgeous interior doesnt hurt it either exactly when cr placed the tl over the es in the feb issue they totally missed the mark as these two cars offer different user experiences not that people wont crosscompare or seriously wont crossshop them but  i cant imagine any person getting into an es330 and thinking they are getting a sports sedan like ride nor can i imagine anyone getting into a tl thinking they are going to have a boatlike isolated ride the tl is not better than the es it is different both are high ranked above their common name baseline counterparts but the es doesnt even offer a sporty like ride it never dawned on me to cross shop buicks the es330 and other dowdy

fwd i climb out of my car and into my cousins is300 and despite identical power and weight ratings and 0 to 60s his car is much more enjoyable to drive i absolutely drool when i see tls they are beautiful but the rwd choices cts 3 series g35 are more fun to drive and substance wins over style for me i know thats not everyones opinion brian tee hee it seems that you just gave the pot a nice big stir  i too prefer rwd to fwd for any and every driving condition that said with enough engineering most any problem can be solved regarding the new tl it does indeed seem that honda has gone a very long way to do just that cure many of the ills that plague fwd cars if my 530i were destroyed today would i opt for a new tl hmmm tempting but probably not more likely to go to a new 3series g35

guess tl is about simplicity just voice command it its faster than having tons of buttons to press danny  seems a little strange quoting all of those figures each one of them from a separate magazine andor source taking the best of each number just to note cr got 67 to 60 not 57 well engineering can overcome certain aspects of fwd torque steer elimination by careful axle length design wheel spin out of corners with an lsd but no engineering can overcome the laws of physics i think were all familiar with a tires contact patch all forces work through it when you expect the front two tires to deal with lateral forces of turning and accelerationdecceleration the tire becomes overburdened more quickly than with rwd where the fronts just have to roll along and steer this type of performance handicap doesnt show up in most performance tests acceleration numbers are all straightline skidpad gs are maximized under light throttle adjustments so it doesnt show up too much there in slalom a cars normal transient behavior is explored and how quickly it can shift back and forth but the driver is hardly turning left and right in a way that fully collapses the suspension more importantly though just like the skidpad tests the slalom is done with just enough throttle to maintain a smoothe constant speed if you want to see where rwd reigns superior over fwd look at track lapping times this is where the driver must brake hard turn in and blast through and out of the corner the rwd will be able to get on the gas earlier and harder and gain tenths through the corners this mimics aggressive street driving more closely than any skidpadslalom brian look at track lapping times yes do that look back through the discussion as i pointed out before real sanctioned races between cars like the integra and 3series dont support your assertion search the web and you can find past seasons of  well  heres one for you\\nhttpwwwsccaprocomwc99limerocktouringresultshtml bxd20 not sure i concur on what you wrote well engineering can overcome certain aspects of fwd torque steer elimination by careful axle length design wheel spin out of corners with an lsd but no engineering can overcome the laws of physics as one sports car international writer noted ted west 102 issue p 19 in the presence of anything more than puny horsepower fwd torque steer is just plain abominable and something had to be done about it as with audi volvo believes the answer is awd very powerful fwders can reduce but not completely eliminate torque steer youre right i shouldnt have engineering can overcome torque steer but rather something along the lines of reduce as far as the lapping times are concerned i dont have much data here at work with me i will have to take a look at home i would be willing to bet that the integra you cite did not have the same power to weight ratio as those rwd cars my point was all else being equal a rwd chassis will be faster around a track when supercar builders ferrari ford gt lambo set out to build an exotic high end sports car they do so with very little concern for cost if fwd was inherently equal to or better than rwd why wouldnt one of them have tried it already is honda on to some sort of voodoo front wheel drive that nobody else knows about and reading over cds comparo it sounds like acura still has a ways to go till they have the tl handling at its full potential it finished third because of a wonderful interior and much more power than anybody else for me the interior is almost irrelevant any car in this class is good enough the straight line power is intoxicating and enticing i smell a mild suspension update in the next year or two for the tl brian for me the interior is almost irrelevant i think i have found my soulmate scca enforces car modifications to make cars competitive this means tires ballast restrictor plates sometimes they miss and a brand wins all of one race so they toss and extra 35lb in them what comparo are you looking at if its the same one im looking at did you happen to notice that if you remove the totally subjective scores of funtodrive and gottahaveit factor the tl finishes first heck ill do one even better if you leave fun to drive and only eliminate the ridiculous gottahaveit i know i dont got to have a bmw the tl finishes 2nd by merely 1 point behind the g35 almost is the key word otherwise wed all be tooling around in some econobox on steroids like the sti or evo every car offers a different driving experience and everyone has a different need as well peoples needs may vary as they grow up if a teenager might prefer a more sportier car like an evosti fast fast fast luxurycomfort doesnt mean anything because they have a lot of time to play with their car or even going to a race track i was young too in my mid 30s i prefer half sport and half comfort but if i am over 45 i might go for a total comfortluxury car if you try nissan maxima or integra gsr you will feel a noticeable understeer i am not saying that understeer doesnt exist in a tl but you cant hardly feel it unless you really go too far this time acura has done a bit too far for a fwd car quoted do you know what they meant by saying that i tried nissan maxima and 2000 integra gsr and its nothing compared to tl and its totally a different experience but still better than the previous altima there are 5 current report that gave the nod to the new tl do you think they all dont know about understeer performance rating in a scale of 1 to 10 rwd may get a 10 while normal fwd usually get 6 if a fwd can get an 8 g3510bmw9 tl8 for me thats more than enough while it gets more rating for luxurycomfortstylingaccelerationsnowmpgresale value maintenance cost considering that people dont take on corner very often in their life or doing it in a race track besides road styles traffics in everydays life dont support those kind of adventure i buy a car according to my need just like everyone else 96 normal driving with less than 5 taking on corners which is hardly to find in these days without getting into trouble or heavy traffic on it btw i like the new g35 coupe id like to know why its perfectly acceptable for mature people to buy porsches but not cars like sti and evo mature men play baseball and drive race cars sport driving is fun at any age and these cars pack it at real good prices id have no problem buying either one i would lose the spoiler on the sti but for track it is there for a reason i dont see any mid 50s going to a race track taking on corners competing with stievo having the adrenalin rush they might get a heart attack if you wanna buy those sports car like porche lambo ferrari you will see mostly low mileage on it perfect condition polished it shows us that the car was rarely driven and mainly for showing offselfactualization need i am still young and energetic hmm i might drive an evosti when i am 60 i wonder what those gals think i dont care what age someone is if he has to worry about what babes think because of his car he has a problem without the babes there would be no corvettes ever sold come on  if it wasnt for beatuiful women the economic world wouldnt even turnwomen are indirectly reposnible for everything going on this planet right nowthus anyone driving an even reomotely sexy car has ambitions of impressing someone beyond themselves  even if just a little lol you are right chris come on admit it there is nothing to be ashamed of so tell me do you two guys try to impress women with your cars id like to know why its perfectly acceptable for mature people to buy porsches but not cars like sti and evo mature men play baseball and drive race cars sport driving is fun at any age and these cars pack it at real good prices id have no problem buying either one i would lose the spoiler on the sti but for track it is there for a reason age i wouldnt touch an sti or evo because i find the interiors scary cheap come on  if it wasnt for beatuiful women the economic world wouldnt even turnwomen are indirectly reposnible for everything going on this planet right nowthus anyone driving an even reomotely sexy car has ambitions of impressing someone beyond themselves  even if just a little chris to each his own i bought my car because its fun i loathe people who talk to me based on my car when a golddigger approaches me and asks a question about my car i give a quick answer and leave at parties i will admit to my protege if asked what i drive and i will deny the existence of my bmw the things i own are my business not theirs but thats just me i would buy the current m45 if it were enough fun as it has exactly the image i prefer totally unnoticed i wouldnt touch an sti or evo because i find the interiors scary cheap ever see a porsche interior so tell me do you two guys try to impress women with your cars  quite the opposite  the woman i love almost left when i sold the passat and got the g things are better now that i allow them to go places together like the bluguy  i am not out there to impress anyone i call my car a nissan on most occasions where the person doesnt know me as a car nut the things blueguys says are the reasons i avoided the 3 altogether alot of attention is not what i needand the passat got way too much i might add but i will add that if there were no women there would be no 3 series in the first place ha suffice it to say that these gross overgeneralizations about women could not be any further out in left field could we just talk about the cars and not devolve into this sort of silliness chrisbut i will add that if there were no women there would be no 3 series in the first place by what logic design ever see a porsche interior oh yeah and i love it yes love it the doors the console the seats all feel just right but remember im a bmw person and i adore the way the germans put together interiors i dont like the buicklike interiors of lexus and acura if anything the only japanese brand i like for interiors isgaspinfiniti austere is fine cold and detached is fine doors that are super light like the nasty bmw x3 or trim that feels brittle like the nissan altimas dash dont do it for me its all subjective but to me i couldnt live with a wrx or evo daily as id feel like i was driving a suped up version of my 03 protege es with its bargain basement interior exactly at 28 id rather have a 10 in performance and a 67 in interior than an 8 in performance and a 9 or 10 in interior but thats where im at in life and i respect where others are too and i doubt that where youre at in life correlates linearly to your age when youre talking auto enthusiasts so back to the tl 0 to 60 in 58 is tremendous is there potential for more whats the cr on that engine is that timing set for 87 or 91 octane i am eager to see what the 36l cts does with a 6 speed manual in a few months brian i have this bet with my friend she thinks you are a man and i think you are woman who is right twenty bucks is riding on this bet did your friend really pay you she is sitting beside me as i am typing we decided to go a restaurant for dinner tomorrow night probably either be applebees or olive garden she is paying of course i believe all sportsedan lovers are latent sportscar nuts cars like the ultimate driving machine et al are only an intermediate step if you are a german car fan and like the minimal porsche interior you know theres only one answer once you start rowing gears in a porsche or any other sports car for that matter youll forget that sport sedans ever existed except for utility in a sports car things such as the interior radio squeaks and rattles have almost no significance of course that is if the drive is what stirs your blood danny makes a good point about ferraris etc you will know the real sportscar enthusiast that is driver by his odometer i have been staying out of here for awhile but have been reading most everything one of my observations is that there are very few women participating the posts about women could take on on another aspectdo your wives or women friends drive your car and what do they think about the tl and others most of the posts here are from men and are performance oriented women are responsible for a large portion of the money spent in our economies i recently read a report that said they were responsible for the majority of the discretionary money spent\\ni bought our new tl for my wife it is the third car i have purchased for her she never test drives them or participates in the selection all three have been acuras a 91 legend a 2000 tl and now an 04 tl i always look for a car that is a cross between sport and luxury i am the sport she is the luxury she loves the new tl including the 270 hp she isnt out racing but is in the car all day driving  sales job  the power comes on gradually and is very predictable\\nshe loves the near luxury especially the seats and the stereo the nav is an absolute necessity as she is constantly having to drive to unfamiliar places the real thing is she looks very nice in that silverebony car and people are constantly telling her what a nice car she drives on the weekends i get to use the sport piece of the equation the new tl is a perfect blend for the two of us after 36 years of marriage i have a pretty good idea of what her expectations are\\ni laughed when i read the thread about old people  anyone over 30 evidently not pushing their cars but buying cushy luxury cars not always so i am 58 and still enjoy driving fast and aggressive where it is safe to do so i started road racing motorcycles at 38 my brother is 60 and has a v8 powered triumph tr7 next time your at a light and the guy next to you is in a bmwtl he may just be like me and decide to have a go paul newman raced well into his 60s\\nbottom linethe new sportluxury cars are a reflection of what people want to buy and in most instances the people who can afford them are older than 30  great post raher bottom line we old goats will blow the doors off you young whippersnappers  i keep getting progressively faster cars as i get older hmmm not sure if i agree with you that a sports sedan is an intermediate step to a sports car whatever that means is pretty grey i think true car guys buy the most performance they can afford regardless of packaging if you have a lot of money to blow then you probably are considering a porsche 911 but lets say your budget doesnt allow that and youre looking to spend 50k at that price point i would be looking at cars such as used m5s new m3s a z06 a ctsv i wouldnt demerit the sedans just because theyre sedans id look at overall performance and upon doing so id see that the m5 and ctsv belong in the company of sports cars if i compare those two sedans against what that money buys me at a porsche dealer a boxster i would actually be taking a step down on the performance scale why so i could have a car with a sports car badge on it brian while i will one day own a useless toy like a 911 turbo it will not be my primary vehicle ever i want performance and practicality and the 911 is all about having fun the m5 to me is still one of the ultimate automobiles in the world this is a true drivers interior in my book and hint it aint german\\nbuick interiors look like playskool plastics compared to lexus and acuras not even close i agree with designman about intermediate step to a sport car if it still has 4 door its not a real sport car it has a second purpose to serve as a family car why a sport car need a good audio system like bose mls hkardon moonroof navigation so you dont get lost in a race track etc just my 2 cents like blueguy said sports sedan drivers are latent sports car nuts but a sports car is a two seater in my book or a 2x2 coupe at most ala porsche 911 sports coupes  sedans are for people who want sporting fun but who have lots of baggage  you can make a case for the sedans and coupes being sports cars as some have sports car like performance and you find them in racing series but in terms of purity 1 or 2 seats max  sports car put it this way you are driving your favorite canyon  mountain road what do you really want porsche gt3 or e55 amg corvette z06 or cadillac ctsv\\n \\ngive me the sports car buickacuralexus  same interior to me theyre designed with the lazeeboy weaned americans in mind soft leather soft touch materials soft soft soft if it still has 4 door its not a real sport car it has a second purpose to serve as a family car why a sport car need a good audio system like bose mls hkardon moonroof navigation so you dont get lost in a race track etc just my 2 cents right the m5 is not a sports car its better than most socalled sports cars ill take the insane handling great power room for 4 adults and their luggage any day over the compromises of say an elise or a 911 an elise or 911 would be a fun weekend toy but i can only imagine the misery of driving 500 miles in a buzzy elise or with the din of an obnoxious ferrari motor in my ear yes i said obnoxious id prefer to never hear my engines or the road unless its a convertible i want zero road wind engine tranny noise dont much care if the car has a radio either buickacuralexus  same interior to me theyre designed with the lazeeboy weaned americans in mind soft leather soft touch materials soft soft soft id prefer to never hear my engines or the road unless its a convertible i want zero road wind engine tranny noise dont much care if the car has a radio either your two quotes are confusing the second seems to support the firstsounds soft soft soft to me perhaps there is a lazeeboy weaned american\\njust under the surface what does a desire for silence have to do with overly stuffed seats and soft materials theres nothing complimentary about the two if i want to hear the engine wind road or tires i can open the moonroof or power down the windows otherwise i want to drive the car with the 6 speed clicking away revs racing car carving down the road in eery removed near silence essentially i want it both ways as it stands now were stuck always hearing something it just sounded like you were exchanging one creature comfort for another to me usually a quiet car is one with near luxury accoutrements the tl is very quiet and not what i would call cushy the seats are a great improvement over previous tls\\nwhen i am driving i like to have the stereo blasting away and the moonroof open just different strokes i guess msg 944\\nbuickacuralexus  same interior to me theyre designed with the lazeeboy weaned americans in mind soft leather soft touch materials soft soft soft msg922\\ni wouldnt touch an sti or evo because i find the interiors scary cheap you dont like excellent interior or bad interior\\nyou like a quiet car and a noisy car you like it both ways so which car you prefer in term of near luxury performance sedan i dont like cheap or soft why is that a difficult concept i prefer the more austere feel and appearance of teutonic machines and even some infinitis over anything offered by lexus acura and naturally the usa as for the sound thing im baffled as to why people think its out of sorts to want your car to be whisper quiet on the inside currently i drive a 2003 330i with the performance package the muffler makes a constant droning rasp that reminds me of my sisters first miata on long drives to so cal with the top down the other bimmers ive ridden in are quieter but still theres too much road and wind and engine noise its not too hard to figure out what i prefer given what i bought the g35 came in 3rd in my choices as i didnt dig the sloppy suspension or typical trucklike nissan manual acuras tl with a 6 speed probably would have come in second as i would have even taken a tsx 6 speed over the g35 nothing else was even close as the lexus is bored me with numb steering a lackluster engine and a very very bad image in so cal teen brats drive is300s around here  the rich kids jettaaccord audis a4 lacks any sort of punch and it has fwd or its godawful powersapping quattro plus i was dropping a vw as they make horrible cars mbs c class is a joke in terms of handling and power ctsrofl it was always a 3 horse race among the manufacturers with decent fun entry lux carsacura infiniti and bmw if only i could be so cursed to have to listen to that awful sound of the enzo 12 cylinder engine as it screamed toward redline in each gear some may consider an engine as noise but in a car of this class it would be music to my ears try it for 7 hours straight and youd be longing for a g sedan or a sedan de ville for that matter ferraris are not made to be driven for more than a few miles imagine the cost of taking one 120000 miles  dont they rebuild it every 36k or something its a race car engine so i guess those few mile rock the concept is difficult to grasp because you say i want to drive the car with the 6 speed clicking away revs racing car carving down the road in eery removed near silence but in your ideal car as you are describing it you cant hear the revs racing and you have no idea when to shift unless you are staring at the tach rather than watching those curves i think thats how you are confusing everyone unless you can feel hear and be totally in tune with the machine you are falling short of true sport driving and thats why i didnt get the 330i i test drove one a year ago loved the performance part and but hated how loudly  imo the exhaust sounded with just a light touch of the gas pedal and that car didnt even have a sport package i like a sleeper type of car that can trounce the pavement and hug curves when called upon the revs racing and you have no idea when to shift unless you are staring at the tach rather than watching those curves i shift by feel not by engine sound i know what my cars are doing by the pull of the engine as i owned a car for years without a tach i almost never look at my current ones shrug same can be said of the speedoim pretty much just always scanning for the fascists in black and whites still stand by my desireabsolute silence unless i decide to add some auditory stimulation you got away without a tach because you could hear it you may think you were only going by feel but your senses work together imperceptibly thats the beauty of the human body its just like the old trick of not being able to fully taste something when you cant smell it if its too quiet you cant tell what is going on by the pull of the engine ok so how does that translate as to when to shift when it stops pulling that means youve hit the rev limiter so you should shift this is one of those things that you should be careful what you ask for because you might get it i am sure that if you got your wish and had a completely silent car you wouldnt have a clue what is going on without looking at the guages maybe after quite some time with the car you could get used to what speed objects are traveling past you to trigger your shifting but it would not be intuitive from the start and would take alot of conditioning i am driving a perfect example now i am currently stuck with a rental 2004 maxima with the shiftronic i cant tell what the heck that thing is doing without looking at the tach because it is so quiet and that quietness also affects the perception of velocity so it turns out im always going much faster than i thought well youre in a better situation than i ami owned one after i turned away from the 330i last year i went ahead and bought a 03 maxima its not as silent as id preferred but its more so than the 330\\nhowever nimble and agile it is not no offense to any maxima fans but i feel its not much better than my 87 integra in term of handling i knew i would make compromises by going with the max but now i think would be much happier with the 330\\noh well you live and learn not much better than your integra considering the integra was considered one of the best handlers of its day thats saying alot i never drove the previous generation although i did test an i30 once so i dont know how different this 04 redesign is i really like the power of the maxima ill give it that but the ergonomics are horrible i dont know who they designed these seats for and forget about changing the climate controls while driving i have to glance down about 3 times to find the button im looking for it does corner much flatter than i expected though im not saying its agile just better than i expected thats all sport sedans are a compromise between luxury cars and sport cars i consider my 530 quiet but i can always hear the delicious growl of the engine whats more as others suggested this should be savored if you dont like noise you have to get a pure luxury car when im driving my boxster s i often turn the radio off just so i can listen to the engine has a jetlike whir and the exhaust notes sound like charlie parker wailing on his tenor sax and when that baby gets to full boil there isnt a sweeter sound in the universe blueguy you said you love the m5 as do i i couldnt imagine wanting to drive that rocket without hearing those 400 horses you must have sensitive ears i have no problem doing long trips listening to the engine what i hate are seats with horrible lumbar support i know 99 of enthusiasts dont agree with me i love to drive but when im in a car id rather not have anything else intruding into my time my favorite part of a road tripwhen my passenger drifts off to sleep and i can turn off the radio and just cruise oh and someone asked how you can tell when to shift without listening if ive got my stereo blasting theres no way in hades i can hear my engine but i can definitely feel on bmws peaky engines where the cars at in the torque curve slight pull is under 3k little thrust is up to 4k press you back in the seat is over 5k given the very distinct build in power of bmws inline 6 its cake to tell where you are on the tach yep beneath that bloated and elongated body the maxima does have power ive been challenged three times already by some ignorant souls driving a windstar a 4runner and a soupedup miata i was like pick on somebody your size punk then i let them eat my dust yeah funny but true\\nand youre right about the seat im slipping and sliding at every corner blueguydotcom completely disagree with your statement nothing else was even close as the lexus is bored me with numb steering a lackluster engine and a very very bad image in so cal teen brats drive is300s around here  the rich kids jettaaccord 1 who the heck cares about image or who drives how many of what what relevancy does that have to do with anything if everyone hated the best cars to drive the worst would you join them or if they all drove the best would you drive the worst just to be different 2 if you want something exclusive keep in mind that sales for 3 series g35 tl and cts are all far far higher than is those other cars are dime a dozen on the road compared to the rare is and the even rarer is sportcross touring 3 there is nothing numb about the iss steering more like razor sharp and precise 4 price out a 325i and an is300 you can have the latter for less if reasonably equally equipped and it can even have more equipment eg lsd you cant even get lsd with the 330i perf pkg which has an msrp almost 10000 more than the is300 your comment had me thinking about the late great superbird hemiengined muscle car some thought it was too flambouyant and over the top back then the wrong crowd wanted them and drove them now they go for nearly 100000 at auction maybe he didnt mean quite numb but ive test driven them and driven my cousins and there is a layer of isolation there id like to know what the front wheels are doing a little more intimately other than that the is300 is a good deal for its size and power and handling someone said cts rofl a few posts back i wont pretend the cts is currently a class leader but it does keep getting better the 36l 255hp with 6 speed manual hits dealers this summer and it will then hang with the g35 crowd which is to say still a bit down on raw power compared to the tl but more along the lines of g35530is300 handling brian riez 1 who the heck cares about image or who drives how many of what what relevancy does that have to do with anything everything its part of the reason i dislike owning a bmw and part of why i like driving my mazda on weekdays if everyone hated the best cars to drive the worst would you join them or if they all drove the best would you drive the worst just to be different no i still bought a car with a very bad public image that fact weighed heavily on my mind before making the trip back to the dealer i talked to two close friends about it extensively as im a torn jeans and old tshirts kinda guy and the bmw carries a stigma i dislike while getting gas on weekends ive actually been asked by other people if i was borrowing my bmw 2 if you want something exclusive keep in mind that sales for 3 series g35 tl and cts are all far far higher than is those other cars are dime a dozen on the road compared to the rare is and the even rarer is sportcross touring unfortunately the is isnt rare here its all over the place and usually travelling in a pack amongst civics and integras i didnt want exclusive i wanted something not owned pretty much exclusively by modder boys with 19 inch rims and giant spoilers 3 there is nothing numb about the iss steering more like razor sharp and precise driven two and id say the steering is numb to each his own you can go round and round on the subjective but neither side can win what feels right to them and not to another you like it as chris likes the road feel of the g35 thats why they make more than just vanilla ice cream 4 price out a 325i and an is300 you can have the latter for less if reasonably equally equipped and it can even have more equipment eg lsd you cant even get lsd with the 330i perf pkg which has an msrp almost 10000 more than the is300 id sooner drive just about anything over a 325i i think its a rip off why pay 30k for a car with no guts and bad worksmanship itd be like owning a vwaudi again your comment had me thinking about the late great superbird hemiengined muscle car some thought it was too flambouyant and over the top back then the wrong crowd wanted them and drove them now they go for nearly 100000 at auction so a toyota altezza transplant with an iron block 30 inline 6 will be a collectors car okey dokey wishful thinking the lack of power and poor steering feel played the biggest role in my decision to pass on an is the car didnt excite me unlike the g tsx and bmw 330i i wasnt smiling while driving the is actually i only wanted to get out of it both times the desperation of the lexus dealership who dropped the price to invoice made me uneasy as they called back over and over with lower offers he was begging me to buy the car creepy finally seeing 1624 year old boys exclusively driving the lexus is reminded me of why i passed on the integra gsr in 97 briansomeone said cts rofl a few posts back i wont pretend the cts is currently a class leader but it does keep getting better the 36l 255hp with 6 speed manual hits dealers this summer and it will then hang with the g35 crowd which is to say still a bit down on raw power compared to the tl but more along the lines of g35530is300 handling i had the misfortune of piloting a 5 speed cts with the old engine it had the socalled sport packaging too the car bobbed and undulated on hard corners the interior was a mess exterior not much better the dealership seemed really enamored with it being a caddy when he asked if id buy one i said it lacked the punch and sublime road feel of the german targets this tool asserted the cts competes against no one as its a caddy okay i guess only pimps would be interested in it thendunno he also scoffed at my request for a manual  even though they had one  as he felt caddies shouldnt have a manual in the end my experience with the caddy was a sharp reminder why american car companies should go the way of the dodo which is to say still a bit down on raw power compared to the tl but more along the lines of g35530is300 handling interesting  when did more horsepower mean more raw power torque by definition is raw power and the tl is the class bottom on that one 325 a ripoffhow about the 330you are paying nearly 7100 more for literally the same car with 5 liters of added displacement if the 325 is a ripoff the 330 is outright highway robbery are you kidding me one car has power the other doesnt im paying 7k extra so i can move in a manner befitting a car costing 3040k theres a marked difference in rumbling to 60 in under 6 seconds and taking well over 7 seconds 3132k for a 325 gets me a car with great handling bad reliability average is bad as hitting the 50 percentile in anything is horrible a lackluster engine horrible tranny and the stigma associated with bmw in my cost to fun ratio the 325i ranks below just about everybody in that segment save for the cts and a4 interesting  when did more horsepower mean more raw power torque by definition is raw power and the tl is the class bottom on that one why g35 is slower than new tl that has 57 secs in 060\\n1 g35 torque is 260\\n2 tl torque is 238\\n3 cts torque is 220\\n4 is300 torque is 218\\n5 330i torque is 214\\n6 325i torque is 175 while its hp is 184 the bottom of the class where the hell did you get that tl horse power is 270 while g35 is 260 subaru wrxsti with 300hp and 300 ftlbs torque with 54 secs in 060 if you like torque power this one is better but with only 03 secs difference just like blueguy said i wouldnt touch it i agree with blueguy about 325i but i still love bmw stylings 3132k for a 325 gets me a car with great handling bad reliability average is bad as hitting the 50 percentile in anything is horrible a lackluster engine horrible tranny and the stigma associated with bmw tranny  it seems with german cars that you get performance and handling but reliability is not too good are there reliable german cars  frankly i have driving an acura for 5 years it may not be the most exciting car but i know it is very reliable and maintenance is not an issue deciding to buy a bmw knowing its reliability and costs has been a difficult one i love acura manual trannies not a fan of the ones they stick in bimmers i dont know how you can excuse the phrase american car companies should go the way of the dodo saying they are going down or were going down or will continue to go downhill implies an opinion of what you think is happening thats one thing to come out and dictate that gm and ford should be driven to extinction is quite rude lets assume for a minute that caddys are 100 trash why not let market forces cause gm sales to dive and cause bankruptcy isnt that what america stands for the free market at one point in history the cars your beloved honda was making would have elicited nothing but laughs from performance enthusiasts yet notice how far they have come because of competition i agree your experience at the dealership leaves much to be desired although it does not excuse their behavior you have to remember that cadillac is fairly successfully compared to say lincoln trying to shift their demographic to a more youthful group old ways are hard to change unfortunately that said i have been treated poorly at a lexus dealership they were all quite smug acting as if their is300 was the only sport sedan in town so i think this attitude comes from certain sales people and not the brand when i said raw power i meant to convey the general pull or kick of the car especially as a reference to 0 to 60 feel sorry wrong choice of words also that 220 you quote is for the 32 cts the new 36 is 255 hp  252 lb ft torque thats why i said earlier it will be in the same ballpark as the fastest other rwds in this class of course thats all paper racing it will be interesting to see what mt or cd say brian blueguydotcom ill let bimmer magazine a most biased source against the is speak for me check out their 401 comparison test of the is300 vs 330ci the lexus steering on the other hand is exemplary not only is it exceptionally tight and precise with just the right level of power assist at all speeds but it gives immaculate feedback as well the steering wheel itself is fat but small in diameter and with no supplemental controls save the at gearshift buttons its nicely uncluttered as well its perfectly capable of communicating precise information about how much grip is available from the front what the road surface is doing to the chassi how much angle is dialed into the wheels etc they said it had superior steering over the 330ci remember this is a biased bmw source id say that is high praise indeed bxd20 while every dealer is different and there can always be a bad apple in the bunch my local lexus and infinit dealers are both heads over heels better than the local bmw dealer the bmw dealer wont even offer loaner cars unless you bought from him this dealer spent a fortune building his new building just a couple years ago but it even lacks a proper waiting area you have to wait over at the ford dealer they share a parking lot and there is no parking for either his cars or yours the bmw dealer about 150 miles away much better though that is a combined bmw mb land rover dealer yet it pales in comparison to the amenities of the lexus dealer down the street and the saddest thing about having traded my two infiniti a few years back was losing the great dealership and wonderful customer service we got to know the staff personally say what you will about their cars but lexus and infiniti have worked hard to dominate the dealership ratings for nearly 15 consecutive years by most sources their customer service is rarely second to anyone else in the car business ctsv 57litre engine 400hp 50k\\ncaddilac engineer said its 060 would be 47 secs but tested by cd 52 secs ctsv 36litre engine 255hp\\n060 67 secs www4fostercom i think the 400hp caddy ctsv is a pretty neat car a sub5 second caddy  who would have thought i give cadillac a lot of credit for making exciting cars i am feeling dated when you mention the superbird there was only one in the small town i grew up in in an attempt to add another one some of the local boys took an old rambler and painted it the same color yellow they built a wing out of scrap lumber and screwed it on the trunk a rudimentary nose was formed out of some plywood when they were done after very little thought they christen it the sh1t bird on the weekends they would cruise the town looking for the real yellow bird and park next to it whenever possible the only person who didnt enjoy the joke was the real birds owner i have never driven an is so ill reserve judgement on whether its steering is worse as good or better than bmws but bimmer is written by hardcore driving enthusiasts they are consistently harder on bmw and their mistakes than any other source that i personally read if i remember correctly that comparison involved an early production 330ci with the new steering it took about 6 months before bmw realizing the mistake switched back to the old steering fwiw i bought an 0101 production 330ci and took part in bmws steering retro offer the difference between the two is huge at one point in history the cars your beloved honda was making would have elicited nothing but laughs from performance enthusiasts yet notice how far they have come because of competition beloved honda i own a bmw and a mazda you have to remember that cadillac is fairly successfully compared to say lincoln trying to shift their demographic to a more youthful group old ways are hard to change unfortunately thats like saying compared to manson john wayne gacey was sorta sane no matter what theyre still american companies and ill freely admit im biased i will buy japanese and german but itd take something mindblowing to ever get me to buy american they said it had superior steering over the 330ci remember this is a biased bmw source id say that is high praise indeed riez are they buying my car for me no then why should i get something i find to offer numb steering using quotes from car magazines is pretty useless when it comes to a subjective thing like road feel kominsky been subscribing to bimmer for a couple years i cant remember a nonbmw beating out a bmw in the comparisons ive read including their review of the 330ci vs is300 blueguydotcom the primary point of the quote is to show that most sources who have actually tested an is300including those not disposed to love ithave raved about its steering your counter assessment flies against the majority opinion cd 1000 surgically precise steering combines with the cars nimble disposition to provide all the moves you need automobile 600 steering is correspondingly quick and accurate mt 900 its steering response so quick precise and communicative that it keeps up with the 328i sport on sheer athleticism cr 501 the steering feels responsive edmunds 701 razorsharp steering cd 304 in 7car comparison is300 steering rated a 9 out of 10 falling only behind the 325is steering just a sampling plenty more of same ill keep looking to see if i can find anyone who calls it numb 6 grand less gets a wrx an is300 loaded gets an sti not to mention the others in the subaru lineup luxury in that platform is a nonfactor and the performance just isnt enough this is why these cars dont sell and lexus should have known this wouldnt mind having a sport cross based just on looks imo its the best looking car in their repertoire and one of the best looking cars period lack of awd drive is a shame so far youve said nothing to justify the 7100 difference between the 325i and 330 the difference is 40 horses its the same car same tranny same poor bmw reliability and unless you are a stoplight racer for a living the 060mph difference is inconcequential the 325i has enough power to move that car very well i personally think they are both a ripoff and thats why i went with an a4but the 330 is by far the biggest insult to ones intelligence blueguydotcom\\nno matter what theyre still american companies and ill freely admit im biased i will buy japanese and german but itd take something mindblowing to ever get me to buy american that speaks for itself as far as the is300 vs 3 series steering feel goes i have another theory to throw out riding in the is300 i feel very well insulated from road noise wind noise drivetrain vibration could all that sound deadening contribute to a lessconnected feel when you dont hear or feel the cracks in the road and your brain is used to doing so it might be interpreting that as meaning avalonlike handling brian i sort of agreed with you up until you said you went with an a4 i would say for 30 k 40 if you really load it up the a4 is very lacking in the power department i have ridden and driven them and they feel way too underpowered handle like a dream and look great but for that kind of dough they should have more power i think everyone agrees that the bmw is a overpriced but everyone also seems to agree that it is a great car i would have loved to have one but could not afford the extra money for the 330 went with a cls and the 325 was just too slow for me sadly i think bmw sells so much because so many people buy them for status and the more they raise the price the more people seem to want them there are plenty of differences between the 325i and the 330 beyond just the engine for starters how about the transmission yes it is different suspension brakes wheels and tires power memory seat left side power seat right side upgraded audio system and of course the ever important trip computer regarding the same poor bmw reliability ummm yeah right hate to burst your bubble however all scientific and anecdotal evidence suggests that the audi line is considerably worse contrast that with my personal experience of over five years of bmw driving and so far i have had two burned out taillights now i realize that the lexus crowd would be aghast at how unreliable my cars have been but personally i can live with that  as for whats a rip off and what146s an insults ones intelligence well one could say that the only car that wasnt an insult would be a completely utilitarian car which will get one from point a to point b and nothing more best regards\\nshipo 95gt i got a loaded a4 18t frontrack for just under 30k it wont win any stoplight races with those 6 cyl engines but it has plenty of power for my purposes id harldy call that a ripoff shipo i am not comparing bmw to audi in terms of reliability i am poiting out to blue that reliabilitywise the 325 and 330 are the same car btwive had two beemers in my family and they were always in shop with electrical glitches compared to their japanese counterparts bmw reliability is poor btw you can get a sport suspension power seats and trip computer in a 325 blueguydotcom the primary point of the quote is to show that most sources who have actually tested an is300including those not disposed to love ithave raved about its steering your counter assessment flies against the majority opinion majority opiniongolly i need to change my opinion to go along with everyone else for the last time unless theyre buying the car for me why the hell should i care what their opinion is i have to live with it and in my experience the is300 has numb steering so far youve said nothing to justify the 7100 difference between the 325i and 330 the difference is 40 horses 40 my car has 235 hpregardless its the same car same tranny same poor bmw reliability actually i have a shortshift 6 speed again not the same oh and different suspension and different wheels and different differential different chip programming lets toss in wholly different exhaust system and headerscams oh and my speed is limited to 155 which i hope one day to try out on a track rather than 123 i believe thats the ceiling for the 3 series normally and my redline is 6800 which is higher than a 325i in addition to the performance upgrades from the 325i to the 330i zhp i also got a few luxury features ive grown to lovememory seats tilt mirror useless fluff to some but the difference between me happily leaving my car for a wash and being annoyed i have to adjust everything back and unless you are a stoplight racer for a living the 060mph difference is inconcequential i dont know where you live but in so cal we have annoying freeway lights 100200 feet to go from zero to 75 am i a stop light racer no do i consistently shift my in the upper region where the engine sings redline shifts are common for me on every drive i bought a performance sedan and i make it perform i often cruise in 3rd of 4th at around 80 mph so that when the need arises i can punch it and take off this cannot be done with a 325i ask my broinlaw as he and his 325i simply cannot keep up with my bone stock car the 325i has enough power to move that car very well i personally think they are both a ripoff and thats why i went with an a4but the 330 is by far the biggest insult to ones intelligence to each his own the a4 doesnt offer the handling especially a fwd one or power i want when spending over 30k for a car theres no reason i should ever have to worry about merging or will i have enough power to shoot a gap if im in a near luxury sport sedan with the a4 i had a 18t the engine pulls pretty well but not with the ferocious authority id expect paying over 30k go quattro and an already slow car is now saddled by an inefficient drivetrain that saps power like crazy add the tiptronic and the cars dead in the water we all have priorities mine were performance luxury and fun for a price i found reasonable as the 325i only offered good handling it didnt meet my performance to price ratio id gladly blow 40k again on my sedan as its a grin producer the 325i wasnt that big of a step up from my old jetta i couldnt rationalize spending 3032k for a 325i that would leave me constantly annoyed at the lack of punch as for whats a rip off and what146s an insults ones intelligence well one could say that the only car that wasnt an insult would be a completely utilitarian car which will get one from point a to point b and nothing more exactly we dont need the 200 hp engines and tight suspensions we want them our cars regardless of marketing hype are totally luxury items what you posted was so far youve said nothing to justify the 7100 difference between the 325i and 330 the difference is 40 horses which means that my response was accurate if you add back in as much as possible to bring the 325i up to the level of the 330i you need to add sport package 1400\\nharmankardon audio system 675\\nonboard comuter 300\\nfront dual power seats 995\\ntotal 2470 that makes the price difference still not quite apples to apples only 4630 that still leaves you with a car with smaller brakes smaller engine and a 5speed transmission instead of the 6speed on the 330i is 4630 too much for all of that for me its worth it for someone else its not is it a ripoff i dont think so regarding the reliability like virtually every manufacturer in the world the reliability has improved dramatically in recent years and statistically speaking the e39 and e46 cars have improved to such an extent that they are among the best how will the e60 fare when the bugs are worked out unknown best regards\\nshipo so what you are saying is that you have the performance package which is another 4000 added to the price to the car without this package the cars are essentially the same and the same options can be added to either listen it is your money to me it makes no sense lets agree to disagree i think the 330 in base form is a bigger ripoff than the 325i btwi dont have quattro or tiptronic mine is a 18t frontrack and cvt the car pulls with tremendous authority and the cvt is a awesome tranny previous to my a4 i had a 2k nissan maxima i like a car with power and i am very impressed with the power of and fuel economy of the 18t engine btwi live in s florida blueguydotcom guess ill just have to defer to your experience and expertise in all matters steering related why would i or anyone else take into consideration what dozens of others might have indicated in their published reports when you have spoken there can be differences in two cars often one test drive isnt enough some specific single cars are lemons others just arent up to the rest deviations from the mean so what you are saying is that you have the performance package which is another 4000 added to the price to the car no it didnt thats a typical misrepresentation of the facts bmw owners do it too get a 330i and then add the sport package and 18 inch rims and wheels at this point youre now talking about a 2k difference for an engine thats modified modded tranny different suspension different interiorexterior treatment heck acura and g35 owners pay 2k just to get cosmetic changes to their cars mine is a 18t frontrack and cvt the car pulls with tremendous authority and the cvt is a awesome tranny previous to my a4 i had a 2k nissan maxima i like a car with power and i am very impressed with the power of and fuel economy of the 18t engine btwi live in s florida im glad you like it i couldnt live with a cvt or the 18t engine again theyre gorgeous cars with excellent interiors and the 18t pulls nicely but i love the necksnapping ability mixed with the docile nature i can get with a shift to 3rd i can go from 60 to 95 in a blink and transform my comfy little cruiser into a brutish thug thats part of why i love my jekyll and hyde car if only bmw let us get that 32 in our 330issighm3 sedan yummy blueguydotcom guess ill just have to defer to your experience and expertise in all matters steering related when it comes to what i prefer with my money i dont even understand how youd have the temerity to toss up journalists as to proof a vehicle should feel a certain way to me i never said the rest of the world should bow down to the bmw or acura or any car i expressed my opinion on what was worth my money why would i or anyone else take into consideration what dozens of others might have indicated in their published reports when you have spoken i honestly dont know why anyone believes a word written in car mags or reviews of anything i judge for myself and make my decision from there experience for yourself and build your opinions from that repeating quotes from car mags is nothing more than parroting the opinions of someone else you can tell me x car is horrible but i must experience it for myself good example im a huge movie buff ive had netflix for near 4 years i see movies constantly watch zero tv and because of my love for film ill give just about everything a shot  b movies iranian film japanese socalled bombs etc with some friends one night we saw an ad for swept away on payperview the common consensus among critics it was horrible someone snorted who would see that i said i had on dvd and it was quite bad another friend added leave it to you to confirm that the universally hated film was bad it wasnt good enough that others liked it or disliked it i had to experience it firsthand there can be differences in two cars often one test drive isnt enough some specific single cars are lemons others just arent up to the rest deviations from the mean thats why ive driven two of them you can keep trying but in my experience with the is300 the car felt numb and disconnected the engine didnt offer the power i prefer like it or not these are my opinions and i will not deviate from tham blueguydotcom having owned a 98 540i6 and a 00 323ia i have some appreciation for bmw steering systems ive also test driven 318ti e39 525i e46 325xi z3 x5 e65 745i etc have you ever done the susan b kosman drive for the cure it is a blast i didnt mind fact e39 540i used recirculating ball instead of rack  pinion in the e39 525i530i both work quite well but i also own two is300s an automatic and a manual the steering in the is is every bit as good as that in the e39 or e46 bmws it is not numb nor disconnected and if it is then i guess so too must be the bmws this is opinion based on actual comparative ownership not just a short test drive or two i also loved the steering in my former infiniti g20t and my former lincoln ls8 sport i find your following comment fascinating i honestly dont know why anyone believes a word written in car mags or reviews of anything arent you writing and essentially providing a review of something guess we shouldnt believe a word im a strong proponent of the value of good automotive journalism and subscribe to nearly two dozen automotive publications i think the point is that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion there is a disagreement here about which it is pointless to continue to argue obviously both of you hold your own opposing opinions and neither have any interest in being persuaded to think otherwise and thats fine  you each feel youve made the right decisions and that is as it should be but rather than expand this disagreement into more of the same with a slightly different background lets just move on thanks 1 the interior is a complete do over expect to see seat controls changed higher quality leathers and an upgraded dash possibly lcd instruments since that is what is coming in the new m35m45 i also expect we will see aluminum pedals added and the titaninum painted center or any painted trim to disappear this makeover of the interior is a 100 redo 2 the sheet metal will not change but the front and rear bumpers will be totally redone and incorporate the aero kits or something very similar to them on both the coupe and sedan models for those of you with 03 model sedans that have been wanting to buy an aero kit infiniti has just reduced the price 23 they are closing them out because next year they will be standard 3 dont look for a horsepower increase because there wont be one but you can certainly look for a price increase the rumor is the updated g will be at the ny auto show next month along with the new m3545the g available in the fall its good to hear the upgrades however nissaninfiniti should learn from this and apply to all future new products that cutting corners to save a penny here will cut sales and hurt image possibly do it right from the onset and reap the rewards as in the new acura tl perhaps acura should learn from infiniti and make a sports sedan that is based on a sports car rather than front drive family car they all look to and learn from each other perhaps they did us a service those infiniti guys and instead of spending more money on the g concept and making it pricier they figured out that what matters is not the interior its perfect balance and a rigid rwd platform get that right first and then improve the fluff stuff also didnt notice infiniti suffering from any reputation probs fyi acura tl sedan sales for\\njan 2004 5036 units es330 5254 units\\nfeb 2004 6274 units es330  units\\nacura tl sales up by 1238 units compared to jan sales and over lexus in jan g35 sedan sales for\\njan 2004 3382 units\\nfeb 2004 3439 units only up 57 units feb2004 for g35 coupe is 2145 units\\ntl sedan sales is more than g35 sedan and coupe combines lol good reputation heh lucky acura didnt learn from people who know so much about sports 47 up in jan 57 in feb thats right after two years on the market the g35 sedan is still selling at the same rate it was from the beginning its also a more accurate comparison to compare sales in the same month of the preceeding year since there is an annual ebb and flow to car sales in general winter is not exactly the best time to sell a sports coupe or a convertible for example g35 sedan sales up 42 from feb 2003 sales of 2410 that comparison is more meaningful im sure the tl did much better this month when compared to its sales in feb 2003 but you also have to consider it is an outgoing model vs a brand new model comparision after two years in the market with all of the complaints about the lack of a manual in its first year plus ongoing criticisms of the interior some valid some not whether or not the styling will remain fresh the g continues to sell agreed they should do that from day one perhaps now that they have money they will these cars that get this criticism most g35 altima were designed at the bottom of nissans problems right when ghosn came aboard 4092 units is the best g35 sedan could do in 2003 augustsummer particularly is the trend going up or down cheerioboy the tls sales no doubt speak for itself in terms of the popularity of the car but if im a tl owner i wouldnt necessarily be happy with this since this means that there are tls all over the place it seems the maxima increased in sales by a bit 5200 for many nissan buyers the maxima is a viable alternative to the g35 if one is willing to sacrifices some sport for room and fwd for snow and is not willing to pay extra for awd a fully loaded maxima and a g35 offer similar features for almost the same price bmw sold 2492 325i and 467 330i this isnt surprising since the 3 is near the end of its model run sales will pick up when the next 3 is introduced but bmw will have to do an excellent job the tl has been a big success the g35 will only get better with the redone interior and lexus seems serious about the next is 3series domination is no longer a gimme in this segment as it once used to be merc1 he didnt say when the 05 g35 would be released but since the 04 g35 and g35 coupe were released in august 2003 i would guess that the 05 would be released around the same time in 2004 the maxy should be compared to the tl imo looks like nissan wins that comp the g is comparable to nothing in the acurahonda lineup only for price sake do we get into the comparison game with g and tl youre right jrock65 but if i want exclusiveness i wouldnt have bought a 3040k car which can be afforded by most people what makes them not buying them is a question of need and quality the only thing that can stop people from buying car are limited edition car expensiveness or less quality comparing maxima to tl that is the only thing that you got maxima is a failure in nissan lol no offense but is the truth gtg if sales are the metric by which you judge success  the maxy rules all subjectivity about looks aside  whats wrong with it other than oversteer problems its fast big and while not as nimble  its a fwd sporty sedan just like the acura the fact that they compare the acura to the g actually says quite a bit for the tl i will concede i wouldnt go too far with it tho as the platforms are very different even if the tl drivers cant tell i stirred it up good this time ma the trend is neither up nor down in my opinion in the long term picking out one month out of the air doesnt make or break a car but comparing janfeb 04 to janfeb 03 does have value you cant compare the summer number to the current number you wont find the manufacturers using that comparison either im not going to get into a sales argument we all know the tl outsells the g35 everyone has their reasons why they pick one over the other valuable discussions regarding sales within a model line would probably be either yeartoyear monthly comparisons or cumulative comparisons  for example fallwinter 200303 to fallwinter 200304 or total yearly sales tl sedan sales is more than g35 sedan and coupe combines lol good reputation heh lucky acura didnt learn from people who know so much about sports 47 up in jan 57 in feb \\nthats an interesting thing youre basically saying the infiniti which hasnt enjoyed good sales over the past 10 years isnt doing well by moving 5060k units of the g most struggling manufacturers would love to offload 3040k cars in those kind of numbers id say both cars are a hit fair enough im just itching for an awd tl 6 speed by may 2006 i couldnt stomach a wrong wheel drive car so maybe acura will meet enthusiasts half way with awd and give us a reason to defect ideally let us split the power with a cpu ala the wrx sti85 rear 15 frontoh yummy looks real likely this will be built 300 hp but doesnt say whether awd is certain httpwwwimakenewscomautospiese_article000214337cfm with improved interior materials i might very well have chosen the g35 instead of the tsx last summer i dont think that the interior layoutstyling wchange will be too dramatic though because the g35 has to remain on the nissan family treethat polarizing funky french tree have you seen the interiors on the fx and murano nissan can do a nice job they just tend to cheap out how do you like your tsx sometimes i wish id bought it over my zhp what dont you like about your zhp if sales are the metric by which you judge success  the maxy rules  i dunno bout you but experts in cd motorweek cr did compare tl with 330i325i and g35 chris maybe you are more of an expert sort of whos right then whereis maxy\\nin fact in edmund 20022003 comparison g35 couldnt outsell the previous 32 tl and considered a tieif not second after bmw how can a g35 win over the new tl how absurd g35 is not as fast as tl\\ng35 is not as well equipped like tl\\ng35 is cheaper than tl\\ng35 is not as luxy as tl\\ng35 does sell less than tl\\ng35 is not as high tech as tl\\nwhat else is wrong with this car to me is a lot and so to other 6 thousand people who chosed tl lol thats is why only 3 thousands people choose g35 isnt that sad for a so called bettersportier car than tl and its cheaper too lol why dont they buy blueguy cheerioboy i respect your opinions i like stirring the pot lol tee hee  g35 is not as fast as tl disagree the cd comparo found the tl to be faster 0 to 60 but the average of the entire sample of tests seems to say that the two cars are a dead heat 0 to 60 and the g35 is slightly faster in the 14 mile g35 is not as well equipped like tl depends the g has some features that the tl lacks and vice versa personally i prefer the exclusive features of the g since bluetooth dvdaudio and voice operation navi isnt worth it is useless to me g35 is cheaper than tl the base g is cheaper than the tl but very very few people get the base g similarly configured the g35 costs a bit more but i would think that this is a plus for the tl not a minus g35 is not as luxy as tl if by luxy you mean better interior then yes g35 does sell less than tl no doubt about it g35 is not as high tech as tl yes the tl has more high tech features again i really like the tl and would personally get it over the g35 depending on how good the 2005 g35 interior changes are i just dont think that either is better than the other in any quantitative sense of the word fair enough jrock i respect your opinion wow no issues with one of your postslol correct id most likely have a g35 coupe now if it werent for these rumors about its interior being redone and because of the interior not being up to the rest of the car in the first place id be sick if i bought one now and they redo the interior 56 months from now jrock65 i hope august is correct sure would be nice m the tl vs g35 debatemy take both of these cars are great naturally you have to open with that line the tl looks better imo has a better interior is a hair faster is fwd  depending and has more features the g35 handles better stops better and is rwd  depending i think its really pointless to argue reliability here neither will match that other japanese luxury brand per the surveys they are both competing for 2nd place here price is pretty much a nonissue too at least around here i think it comes down to whether you want more luxuryfeatures or more performance straightline speed isnt everything and rwd handling characteristics neither one of these cars clobbers the other overall m merc1 im cool with your opinion lol i think i know what is the other japanese luxury brand i like it especially the ls430 not really near luxury but performance sedan in every sense of the term httpwwwrsportscarscomengcarsbmw_conceptm5asp 500 hp i think itll be a tad faster than the tl or g35 i think itll be a tad faster than the tl or g35 who cares its still ugly i knew this was going to happen a 500hp v10 a 7speed smg transmission the e55 rs6 stype r xjr s55 and other so called highend sport sedans have all been surpassed styling aside which im starting to like this new m5 is going to inhale the cars in its segment in dynamics and performance m the maxima vs the tl youre kidding right have you driven both im unfortunately driving a rental 2004 maxima right now trust me there are many many good reasons why it doesnt even come close to the tl it does have power yes but thats where it all ends horrible torque steer and sloppy road and steering feel kill any performance that doesnt involve straight lines and dont even get me started at how bad this interior is i have to make an appointment with my chiropractor just because im driving this car i enjoyed my 98 mazda 626 more than this thing if it werent for the engine id have nothing good to say about the maxi is it worse that the last gen driven 04 tl not max since 01 or 02 what dont you like about your zhp beyond not liking the tranny or the stigma of owning a bmw the cars a blast its way too much fun yet there was something smooth purposeful and subdued about the tsx that i really liked as ive said before if the tl has awd in 2006 it will likely get my business its been almost a year since i got the bmw and im still not comfortable with the attention it gets im fairly certain now that i flat out could never be comfortable with something like a porsche or ferrari who cares the m5 is still ugly screw the appearance of the car its beautiful for what it can do not what it looks like i couldnt care less about the sheetmetal that thing will flat out obliterate any other sport sedan made seating for 4 a decent sized trunk and enough power to plaster a grin on your face road test report on tl and an intro report on their longterm g35x awder they like both appear to rave a bit more over the g35 than the tl they pan the tls problematic torque steer issue mentioning they wish it were rwd its beautiful for what it can do not what it looks like i agree its just going to take me awhile to get over the bangle affect yeah im surprised about that lol you really know your stuff about cars and usually have facts to support your arguments sometimes i just like to mix it up a bit to get some more dialogue but normally im real laid back and just like to read a lot actually im really an acurahonda man more than lexus i enjoy the more sporty aspect and connected feel but i love the lexus quality and tight workmanship like the old sc400 i still think the g35 coupe is darn sexy and love that angry snarl when you hit it my old 94 prelude vtec was a blast to drive and also had that snarl when the vtec kicked in around 4500 rpm i think acura finally is coming back to life after being neglected by the parent company for so long the new nsx looks real promisingabout time and the new rl should really ignite the segment but then theres the new m3545 which are basically a scaled up and more plush g35 its been almost a year since i got the bmw and im still not comfortable with the attention it gets im fairly certain now that i flat out could never be comfortable with something like a porsche or ferrari that is surprising since here in s florida a bmw 3 is as abundant as a toyota camry baby beemers barely raise an eyebrow now drive in with a ferrari and you have everybodys attention i never tried the previous gen thats the weird thing bimmers are ubiquitous in san diego too i could count 50 bmws on my daily drive to and from work i only drive my car on the weekends so 89 days a month and invariably some random person will comment on it if i park any place other than at home or work last weekend 3 people approached me about the car  at a blockbuster at the gas station i get the most questionscomments there it seems and parking on the street in pacific beach i still dont see many 330i zhps on the road so it could be that it looks different enough from the standard 3 that people are curious i know many women have asked what model my bmw is as they like it maybe a standard 3 wouldnt get so many comments shrug i know in all the years i had a jetta or a stanza nobody ever walked up to me and started talking about my car or weirder still asked to sit in it this isnt a freaking lambo my friends used to call my gray stanza the undercover car as it could move about unnoticed the jetta too felt that way in my protege im as anonymous as a speck of sand on the beach in fact this morning i passed a friend of over 12 years on the freeway and waved and got nothing i called her cell seconds laster and she said she didnt see my car anywhere which car the bmw the m3 and zhp pakages look pretty tuff  they do look very different to me than a 325 for sure the only attention i used to get in a 328 in south florida was the bird  i go for 6 months without even getting honked at but in sunny fla the guys sitting on back of work trucks with nothing to do on thier way to job site flick cigarettes on the car or simply scream and flip you off  this happened weekly my choice for infiniti has paid off  no one seems to really notice it latelythe coupe sticks out tho  like yasser araafat at a briss chris yeah s florida drivers are truly a rare breed i am surprised how some of these people get their drivers licenses blue talk about attention when i had my maxima se everybody wanted to race me at every other stop light thats the wrong attention although every once in a while id open it up to show that the vq is no slouch what a great engine i am pretty much left alone with my a4 because they are also becoming very common around here i loved the old 30 vq im not real moved by the 35 but its still a solid engine coming in to la on the 101 is like riding on the bmw expressway everyday i see a dozens of 5s and 7 series and probably 50 3series of all styles  generations the last three days i have seen 3 or 4 7s in a row in one lane its amazing where all this money is coming from the next hot car is the g35 i see a dozen of those cars each way i am starting to see a few more of the new tls i have noticed 2 or 3 new ones traveling in every morning one thing is very interesting i noticed that the g35 drivers are fairly courteous never competitive when i ride in the aero wagon and an audi or bmw pull up sometimes i get competitive power on i always nod to the m3s and m5s but its the new 7 series drivers that always show out my cousin just bought a nissan titan fullsize pickupnice truck the interior is fresh and modern without being too contrived unlike the g35 and maxima the plastics and switchgear are kinda cheap but oh well i must admit ive never seen the fx or murano interior in person so i cant comment on their quality but i was referring to the common styling theme that nissan is following right now overall its not where i would want to spend much time i like bmws so much prebangle because their designstyling is purposeful they look and feel the way they do because its the most efficient way for the car to go about its businessno unecessary scoops curves grooves etc as for my tsxim loving it now that its got some miles on the clock the engine has really opened up and it breathes like a sprinter i swear if it didnt have a fuel cutoff at 7500 it would zing up to 10000 without a problem the cold temperatures also make a big difference with that big i4 i love downshifting to 3rd behind slowmoving traffic and slingshotting out and around this car has some serious midrange gruntno need for 4 cyl apologies here im taking my tsx to another bmw cca track event later this month hopefully i can grind down those allseason michelins enough to justify some new shoes yokos before the summer it took a little getting used to the drivebywire throttle but ive finally got heelandtoe down in the tsx and it is so sweet and yes it does have that gorgeous interior and slick 6speed that i never grow tired of i sometimes regret not biting the bullet and getting the bmw not so much for its driving experience since the tsx satisfies very nicely its just that i originally wanted something different nonjapanese and my smarter side ruled against it you know what i really want is a cherry 1989 325is to play with sport suspension bbs rimsoohhh it really is the best sport sedan bmw ever made or at least my favorite and id buy one tomorrow if it crossed my path like you my sport sedan only comes out on weekends so it is much more fun to drive because every drive feels like the first time i must tell you though we got a new volvo v70 for munchkins in january and i really enjoy driving it smooth ride barkalounger seats and it just looks cool regards brian isnt it funny how absence really does make the heart grow fonder i slip behind the wheel of my car on friday nights and it feels like a darn solid race car after 5 days of driving my rickety loud tinny little protege as a friend pointed out one day i even refer to the bmw as my car and the other car the one i own i call the commuter or by its name its the redheaded stepchild in my automotive family btw im not an suv guy but golly that armadas insane i sat in one at a dealer and i felt like i was in a leatherlined bus btw im not an suv guy but golly that armadas insane i sat in one at a dealer and i felt like i was in a leatherlined bus i felt the same way when i checkout out the lincoln blackwood edition talk about 56k worth of stigma speaking of stigma i dont understand why we let ourselves be influenced by the sometimes ridiculous opinions of others thats all that stigma is a negative overreaction to the negative opinions of others true regardless we all let society shape our viewsbehavior in some fashion i believe i posted a message sometime waaaaaaay back about six months ago about my personal experience with both cars my sister and i own both the 03 max se and 03 tls the tls has slight advantages in handling smoother ride smoother engine at high rpm and possibly exterior look i like the max interior ergonomics quieter engine smoother transengine interactions both cars have slush box and bigger size to most people both cars are about equal overall except for 20004000 differences in prices wincentives on the max now i havent testdriven the 04 tl yet but i assume that the new smaller size and slightly more powerful engine would increase its performancehandling potentials even further i tested the 04 max the first day it arrived in the dealer and noticed that while the engine was even smootherquieter than the 03 and the drive had been improved with the new rear ind suspension setup the cars bigger size reduced the handling part to just marginally better than the 03 and dont even get me started with the new interiorwhat the heck were they thinking when the new 06 bmw 3series come out in late 05 ill probably trade in the max for the older version 05 3s personally i think the current 3series has the best overall exterior look especially in titanium silver and the size is just about right for meyes ive grown tired of the bigger max now if i can only get pass the bmw reliability issuesoh well then theres always a tl  i agree the g35 is hot i see more and more of them around the wealthy suburbs of dc i bet in the past a large  of those would be 3s im sure new tl will show up after all old ones were all over the place surprisingly the hot suv to my eyes is the murano its starting to compete with rx mdx and volvo in burbs well not too surprising it got more style than any of the others thanks for the rundown on the maxis good to know im not nuts for hating this thing i strongly suggest checking out the 04 tl i did try the previous gen tls and while i liked it i found it rather boring the new one is a huge improvement the one thing i do not like about about the tsxtl is that they have not shaken their honda family resemblance the tsx is an euro accord and the tl  i see the old civic tailights on this car is just a larger version of it what i liked about the g35 is that no current nissan car looks remotely like it i applaud honda for giving acura a more aggressive look the old tl was just blah to look at but i look at a tsxtl and still see just another accord on the road the maxima looks like a twin brother that is a little too addicted to sausage pizzas i find the g35 look tolerable but its not exactly svelte either sedans are bloated across all automotive brands grotesque features no attention to fine details rubenesque is in my advice to auto designers have a salad dont get me started about the new maxima i despise its looks now the g35 coupe is sex on wheels hey whatever turns you on i always thought fashion models could stand to eat a sicilian slice or two  drove a 330 and a 325 this week both awd bad driveway ny winters liked them both  great feeling car for the limited time i got to do it while i might not have thought this if i drove just the 325 after driving the 330 the 325 power seemed nice but not great of course in most cases not a real issue im off in the near future to drive a g35x on paper looks like i can have 330 power for less than 325 price at a higher level of equipment cd changer leather and still less than the 325 recent years reliability looks comparable nothing else looks close to these two to me audi has some reliability issues i think no volvo dealer nearby and not so sporting awd is a must have thoughts tim indeed g35 coupe has a nice shape and aft section front is a little bulbous but ill buy the sexy description i also think evo and is sport cross are sexy but to me the real lookers are the sports cars 911 coupe and targa boxster miata s2000 350z coupe and roadster i think the new vette is an improvement but it cant seem to shed that big truncated butt z4 should be used as prop for cgrade monster movies such as the blob g35  max share some family resemblance but total effect is quite different g35 sedan looks light where max is just too heavy handed when previous tl came out as a concept i was very impressed by its look a relative of mine was looking for a car i recommended the car to him he bought the car before it came out as production by the end of its cycle i couldnt stand the sight of that car to me the design aged really badly the new 04 maxima is never in my plan to replace my current maxhonestly i like mine better to me it seems that while acura has moved the new tl closer to the bmw 3series nissan did just the opposite with the new max for someone whos looking for a family sedan with room and power to spare the max is an excellent choice however for a single guy like me who likes corners and twisties a more agile and smaller sedan would be more preferable when its time for my tradeup the only cars i have in mind are the new tl  the g35g35x possibly the upcoming 250hp awd subaru for the awd factor and the 3series as the most favorite i like almost everything about the car except reliabilitysorry didnt mean to sound like a broken record  what i like about the g35 is the overall shape numero uno in judging appearance imo it has a fluid airfoil shape similar to the 911 also none of the details and proportions scream for attention i think they could have done a better job with the headlights and grille though headlights say maxima grille says cadillac tl has subtle details but is too wedgy and chunky in the rear accordingly the shape is a bit unbalanced and that swathe running just beneath the beltline looks like an afterthought incongruous id bet they added that near the deadline after thinking the car looked too vertical to give the impression of less height the wedge works better with smaller cars like tsx and rsx by the way on the acura website they do a great job of reducing the chunky rear with lighting\\x85 notice how dark the bumper is in all shots but when it comes out into real available light the butt is very large i146m sure the tl is going to be a winner but i think it would have been deadnuts perfect by reducing the angle of the wedge a bit the wedge may say sport but it does not say elegance\\x85 larger sedans have to keep it to a minimum not totally happy but i146ll take either one of these cars on looks\\x85 for the most part there is harmony and order to the details and lines\\x85 no unnecessary topography they sure do beat the bangle bimmers i like the tls shape i prefer creases and hard lines and edges i do not like large flat surfaces  like the slab sides of the g35 the cts and the just plain ugly doors on the g35 coupe the new bangle designs also feature too many flat surfaces bangle seems to model everything after mushy ice cream that was refrozen weird angles nothing solid and exceptionally bland i can go for creases and edges but again they have to be subordinate to the overall shape ctv has something going but the shape is so unbalanced that it looks freaky like a caricature and that vertical crease on the trunk and rear bumper is excess makes the car look like a crushed orange juice carton mushy ice cream that was refrozen good description bangle calls it flamed surfaces i dont like bangles designs at all i think he screwed up the 7 series and the z4 is hard to look at the 5 series is growing on me but only when it looks like this httpwwwsupercarsnetsdbqid2920 edsel and aztek grew on me a little bit hasnt happened yet with e60 in my opinion the tail pipes make the e39 m5 and amgs look good not so with e60 they make it look even dorkier depending on what time of the morning you are driving 530amyou may be seeing bmws being driven from port hueneme to various dealers that is why they are in a line i have seen them all from the 7 to 3s interestingly they are somes disguised to hide new models makes the drive fun from west valley to pasadena i drive a 330i and dream about the new 6 waiting for that to drive by you are right about the previous tl especially the trunk front is okay but not the butt i heard someone said that there will be a new tl with awd comparing the tl and the g final days i like both cars but have my issues with both for starters the tls interior blows away the gs but by no means is the g terrible yet the g blows away the tl in my opinion when it comes to driving i drove both and dont like the way the tl drives and dont know why the g i like but then again i just dont know aaaaahhhh i hate car shoping things are too hard the tl though just reminds me of a rebadge honda accord and that really gets under my skin where as the g doesnt really remind me of anything how soon do you need to get the car\\nif the interior is your major gripe about the g and if you can wait you might consider waiting until the 2005 comes out theyre apparently redoing the interior with that dilemma you will want to spend some time reading the posts in our very active infiniti g35 vs 2004 acura tl discussion  thatll keep you busy for a while  best of luck with your decision and isnt it really nice to have this kind of problem to deal with  consumers most wanted vehicles for 2004 survey is posted and ready for your input tl sales up 576 percent compared to 2003\\ntorrance calif 03022004  continuing its recordbreaking streak for the fourth consecutive month acura posted february sales of 15155 vehicles shattering the previous record of 13677 set in february 2001 and ending the month up 338 percent compared to last year the division announced today yeartodate acura sales rose to 28286 up 294 percent compared to last year the tl performance luxury sedan and mdx luxury suv both set new february records the tl acuras top selling vehicle for the past five months sold 6274 units and beat the existing record of 5878 set in february 2001 compared to the same month last year tl sales increased 576 percent the popular mdx set a new february record of 4929 units an increase of 92 percent versus a year ago demand for the new tl sedan is stronger than ever said dick colliver executive vice president sales the allnew car is doing an excellent job of attracting new buyers to acura the hotselling tsx sports sedan also continues to perform above forecast with sales of 1959 units 05 acura rl  as you probably know by now a prototype of the production 05 rl is set to be unveiled at next months new york international auto show as usual the temple of vtec will be in attendance delivering full coverage just recently weve heard some information from several diverse sources and the info seems to be fairly solid some of the stuff has already been confirmed by logical interpretation of public statements but some of it is new in the first category is the drivetrain  we can say with virtually 100 certainty that it will be a v6 with awd the awd system will almost certainly be based upon the pilotmdxs vtm system one source in our own forums goes a step further and reports that the standard torque biasing will be 7030 front to rear current horsepower estimates peg the car at around 300hp weve heard a number of figures on displacement ranging from 34 to 38l but our best guess is that it will use a 35l variant of the tls motor ima does not seem to be a part of the equation at the time of launch other interesting tidbits the rl will feature fairly extensive use of aluminum body panels roof hood and trunklid the car will also continue to build upon acuras renewed emphasis on performance the car is said to perform as well or better than the hot 04 tl recall the tl 6mts very impressive skidpad and slalom figures based upon our sources it seems the car will be positioned lower than where earlier rumors had it pegged those rumors indicated it would be a true 7series sclass or lexus ls competitor while the tl is positioned against the 5series yet priced like a 3series the rl will very likely fall somewhere in between the 5series and 7series in size pricing will probably not deviate too far from the current rls pricing and the content level will build upon the tls segmentblasting features weve heard a few reports that luxury items such as power adjusted rear seats will appear on the rl its our understanding that the cars audio system was not developed with els i will personally be surprised if it surpasses the tls superb els system as in past legendrl models the cars development was carried out almost entirely in japan and it will be built there as well one source in our own forums goes a step further and reports that the standard torque biasing will be 7030 front to rear current horsepower estimates peg the car at around 300hp i hope thats a misprint and they meant 30 front 70 rear what sort of fool would want a performance sedan with 70 of the power going through the wrong wheels what sort of fool would want a performance sedan with 70 of the power going through the wrong wheels maybe the same fools who are helping set sales records for fwd cars maybe you need to ask yourself what qualifies you to call anyone a fool based on your opinion of what constitutes a performance sedan this board is full of posts with statistics on performance and handling of fwd rwd and awd and in the end there is very little actual difference in the objective facts most of the differences are opinions held by individuals who seem to lack respect for someone elses opinion i drive a fwd performance sedan and i am no fool if you have awd then the safety reasons people opt for fwd are now null with that safety element now gone theres no reason for acura to retard the cars performance with the majority of the power running through the front wheels by default awd would allow acura to finally move away from that which keeps many buyers at bay you seem enamored with sales numbers so maybe this would appeal to you if acura offers a performance sedan that finally drives like a performance sedan while also offering a drive system that meets the safety needs of the fwd buyers acura could increase sales suddenly two camps now see value where before only one group of buyers would i have nothing against fwd buyers i do have a problem with a manufacturer finally taking a step toward making a performance sedan by switching to awd but then curtailing the vehicles performance by keeping power going through the steering wheels awd properly set up on a tl would get my business and probably that of many others fwd on the tl will not they could have 500 hp coming out of that car and it could cut through the slalom at 90 mph i still wouldnt buy it as my primary fun car as it just doesnt cut it for me anymore i am not enamored by sales statistics they do however point out whether a company is making money at what they are doing assuming their cost elements are being met they also show whether consumers are buying their product from acuras perspective they have always built fwd cars and they have always been able to sell them the fact that tl sales are up 57 lets acura know they dont have to make any major changes to their manufacturing facilities by switching to rwd or awd assuming their market share will increase by switching to another drivetrain is a risk they may not be willing to assume since they are already increasing sales it will always be about making money for the major manufacturers\\nsales usually dictate changes the rl has fallen way behind in the luxury class because it has not kept pace with the competition the consumer has dictated that acura make changes or get out of that market segment acura engineers have decided that a 70  30 split is what they want to do for their awd i guess they forgot to consult you prior to their decision but they seem to have an enviable track record making decision on their own\\nits all about choices and how those choices do or do not succeed in the marketplace i dont think you can objectively prove that a given split is ideal for every awd car check out fordvehiclescom click on gt under the vehicles list then download and watch the 60 second commercial for the upcoming gt also check out the making of video too amazing i think all enthusiasts will get a real charge out of this it shows a great demonstration of throttle induced steering check it out it sure made me grin from ear to ear i am a little bit worry with tl sales goes up so high it might makes tl more expensive when the new model come like the awd tl or it might makes them overpriced since the demand is higher than supply but i hope the manufacturer keeps upgrading the car as others do too getting fat and lazy was what happened with acura the legend as for fwd as long as it does the job i am fine with it it is one of the best handlingranks 3rd in cd but overall it ranks first to most magazines it is a lot better than integra gsr fwd doesnt make people unable to take a fast corner right especially with lsd vsa tcs in tl and i think with awd tl will be more unstoppable the fact is even with fwd the sales is unstoppable already but thats just my opinion i have been at nearly all the boards just reading and learning im planning on getting my car by the end of april though last night after i wrote a thought came to my head i remember that the 03 tls had some transmition problems in both the s and the regular is it fixed with the new tl has anyone been plagued with similar problems ive had my share of trany problems and dont care to go through anymore can anyone tell me acura engineers have decided that a 70  30 split is what they want to do for their awd i guess they forgot to consult you prior to their decision but they seem to have an enviable track record making decision on their own\\nits all about choices and how those choices do or do not succeed in the marketplace i dont think you can objectively prove that a given split is ideal for every awd car at this point thankfully its all conjecture and there is no official confirmation that the rl will have a ridiculous 7030 split and subarus pretty much proven a 3070 split frontrear allows the wrx sti to marry blistering acceleration with superb cornering as oversteer can finally be induced something that was nigh impossible with the normal wrx doesnt make people unable to take a fast corner right especially with lsd vsa tcs in tl and i think with awd tl will be more unstoppable the fact is even with fwd the sales is unstoppable already but thats just my opinion vsa and tcs are not good things to hardcore drivers gadgets like those keep you from getting into the real fun4 wheel drifts for instance as for sales as an indicator of quality i point to mcdonalds and camerons titanic as shining examples that the most popular alternative isnt always the best as for sales as an indicator of quality i point to mcdonalds and camerons titanic as shining examples that the most popular alternative isnt always the best excellent post check out the ford gt video youll love the powerslide one thing for sure you cant do that in a fwd as for sales as an indicator of quality i point to mcdonalds and camerons titanic as shining examples that the most popular alternative isnt always the best thats the most illogical and ridiculous statement ive ever heard were talking about spending 35000 give or take on a car not 20 for a burger and a movie wasnt someone here using the sales figures to make the point that the tl was a better car than the g35 due to better sales numbers what is the split on the audi a4 and a6 quattros is it fwd biased since its based on a fwd platform i do agree with danny that sales of 30k plus cars are a more relevant indicator of quality than say burgers or movies true the most popular alternative isnt always the best but the thing is there is no best i dont think that you really have to worry about tl sales being so high that itll push up the price tl sales have been climbing month after month but street prices have been coming down so that you can generally get a nonnavi for about 31000 sales are not an indicator of quality in any market ford gm and vw sell crazy numbers of cars id expect a nonnavi tl to go for about 15002k under sticker to paying msrp for an acura no way i wont pay msrp for anything i would disagree with you sales are an indicator of quality but not the sole indicator of quality of course low quality products from say ford or gm can sell in high numbers but there are other factors that go into sales such as marketing low prices and incentives and customer loyalty i would guarantee you that as crappy as some of the ford or gm products are if they made cars of yugo quality they wouldnt sell nearly as well a perfect example of this is hyundai when they first came out they sold like hotcakes mainly because they were cheap then all sorts of problems with quality surfaced and sales plummeted then hyundai started to gradually increase the quality of its products and sales are on the rise again but i agree with your general point that high sales dont automatically equate to high quality as for sales as an indicator of quality i point to mcdonalds and camerons titanic as shining examples that the most popular alternative isnt always the best i am wondering where you made a leap from what was in my posts about sales to sales being related to quality  please point out where that was in my posts you are inserting something that was not any part of what was being discussed\\ni certainly hope acura consults you prior to doing anything as stupid as deciding on their own what the best split is for their awd god forbid they would utilize their own engineering history and experience\\n999  of the general public buying and driving performance sedans will never drive their cars to anywhere near their limits they will however probably drive in snow and rain and make their buying decisions based on those kinds of factors\\nthere are a small percentage of drivers who do enjoy driving their cars near the limit they tend to gravitate towards sites such as these that is not however a true reflection of the general buying public it is why fwd cars still sell as well as they do and why awd cars sell as well as they do\\nracers and enthusiasts choose rwd or awd because they are going to push their cars to the limits and rwd is the best drive train for driving on the edge i just dont believe the majority is driving close enough to the limit to really benefit automakers make cars for the majority because they have to stay in business those automakers who participate in racing use it as development and eventually pass on what they learn to their production models\\nnear luxury performance sedans are not race cars they are a little bit of luxury and a little bit of performance some lean more towards one than the other and we make our choices accordingly 35k these days gives you some very nice choices and in the end i still think they are all very close in any comparison you do i think the car i bought has excellent performance safety luxury and yes it has fwd\\nits not worth the risk to four wheel drift on the open road these days its roulettejohn law is waiting for you right around the corner\\nthe racetrack is the place to play the personal jabs are not necessary  that is not however a true reflection of the general buying public it is why fwd cars still sell as well as they do and why awd cars sell as well as they do i wouldnt say otherwise only that enthusiasts rarely gravitate toward fwd awd on a tl would open up sales to a group who wont touch the tl  people like me racers and enthusiasts choose rwd or awd because they are going to push their cars to the limits and rwd is the best drive train for driving on the edge i just dont believe the majority is driving close enough to the limit to really benefit again its who are they trying to appeal to ive read on bmw boards and actually heard from my salesperson of people who bought the 330i performance package and then found it was too rough for their liking bmw didnt make that package for everyonemy brother in law owns a 325i thinks my car is too fast too loud and too rough to each his own automakers make cars for the majority because they have to stay in business those automakers who participate in racing use it as development and eventually pass on what they learn to their production models youre missing the point of you dont just want a wide market but also find ways to nail the smaller niche that will pay extra i love the visual concept of the tl someone posted here300 hp 18s etc the car just needs the right drivetrain near luxury performance sedans are not race cars they are a little bit of luxury and a little bit of performance some lean more towards one than the other and we make our choices accordingly 35k these days gives you some very nice choices and in the end i still think they are all very close in any comparison you do i think the car i bought has excellent performance safety luxury and yes it has fwd its important that we like what we buy hopefully acura will offer something by 2006 that will get me to buy from them i want to give honda my money but i also want to like the car i drive give me a sweet honda tranny at least 270 hp and awd and ill be a happy monkey its not worth the risk to four wheel drift on the open road these days its roulettejohn law is waiting for you right around the corner\\nthe racetrack is the place to play copsargh in san diego the chp has gone from annoying to fascist apparently the head nonpermissible content removed in sacramento said speeders are evil and instead of looking for real crime the cops should harass us ive heard sd tickets have increased insane amounts over the past year its gone from 75 in a 65 is okay to 70 in a 65 might get you a nightstickcarrying mustached goon breathing donuts particles on you tracksi wish unfortunately when those events occur at qualcomm id have to to endure bmwcca types i may break down one day and join up just to get access to the road courses but i dont like the idea of membership in any group with bylaws check out p 9 of the 3804 issue of autoweek their brief review of the tl aspec the one they drove had an msrp of 41893 excerpt almost makes me forget about the bmw 3 series almost  overall the tl isnt quite as smooth or as refined as the mighty 3 it is close though really close like all the other testers they too complain about torque steer there is some torque steer if you really plant your foot into the throttle ends by stating id probably take the tl over an audi a4 jrock is right there is no clear cut winner in 30k39k car there is always a thing or two missing in one car compare to another blueguy i think you misunderstood me between quality and affordability g35basic price 285k\\nes330basic price 325k\\ntlbasic price 332k\\n330ibasic price 358k\\nbigmac 3\\nalthough very few people choose basic model if not none the story of sales doesnt match if it is about affordability only according to affordability factor people would have bought more g35 then es330 then tl then 330i and they could only buy the very basic model so affordability does very little in this sales story then if it is about quality then 330iif you think 330i is the best should have better sales between those car and again like jrock meant there is no single factor that dominate peoples mind in choosing the car its a combination of both about mcdonald i prefer burger king i have to do some research first before i try to comment about burger not my field i guess lol about torque steer i choose a car based on my purposes only\\nhow many time you plant your foot to the pedal when taking a corner tls cornering is not the best but one of the best imo\\nhow many time you speed your car when driving in a highway many times lol\\nhow much time do you spend inside your car\\nhow many time do you risk your car in a race track\\ndo you care about resale value or not\\ndo you care about gas consumption or not\\ndo you care about your family or not are you selfish etc sorryi have to add reliability resale value performance features gas consumption luxury to me is considered as in quality i tried to make assumptions what if g35 or es330 or 330i was the one on the top sales chart i wonder what is the dominant factor i was confused myself  do you have the answer intensive marketingadvertising programs patriotism doesnt apply to these cars except gm ford fanaticism better incentives popularity different market segment i dont see any of those apply to these cars what do you think iwantonetoo what is it that makes people buy the car luck is not a smart answer youve completely missed my point sales indicate only that x number felt product a was worth their dollars thats it 5k people dug the tl last week it doesnt mean its a good car bad car or reflect anything about the car only that 5k people dug it about torque steer i choose a car based on my purposes only\\nhow many time you plant your foot to the pedal when taking a corner tls cornering is not the best but one of the best imo\\nhow many time you speed your car when driving in a highway many times lol\\nhow much time do you spend inside your car\\nhow many time do you risk your car in a race track\\ndo you care about resale value or not\\ndo you care about gas consumption or not i can answer every question with one thing toy thats what my bmw is to me its not transportation an investment or practical its a toy do you care about your family or not are you selfish etc what does this have to do with buying a car it does to me bcuz if i dont care about them i would buy a coupe not sedan with stiff suspension loud engine and no sound system so i could take the car to a race track no wife and kids at last free from the jail lol fyi its not 5k people who dug tl lastweek but 6k people i respect your opinion as you refer your car as a toy i think you must be very rich but not me i am not rich and i earn my living by working hard the reason is because product a was worth their dollars hmmm thats a good one it doesnt mean good or bad agreed well i feel that relative sales numbers to crossshopped items do reflect something about the product whether it be the tl any other car or any other product for that matter i guess well just have to disagree and leave it at that in any case i for one am glad that the tl is fwd i definitely feel that rwd is more fun to drive and that fwd has its limits but some people want a sporty experience in a fwd setup for foul weather purposes and are not willing to pay the extra 2000 or so to get awd and its associated decrease in gas mileage it just makes more economical sense for honda to make the tl fwd since platform sharing with the accord and the tsx helps keep costs down they dont make a single rwd sedan yet even though hondaacura na sells more cars than nissaninfiniti na nissan is a significantly bigger company in japan than honda i respect your opinion as you refer your car as a toy i think you must be very rich but not me i am not rich and i earn my living by working hard sighall entry lux cars are toys the class of vehicle is by definition a luxury item we could all get by fine with a 1995 accord yet were blowing 303540k on silly cars im not gonna get into some personal thing about working hard or not leave the personal stuff out of it danny1878 why are you including the lexus es330 in this group there isnt anything performance about it you should be including the is300 is is rwd can be had with optional lsd and is available with a manual transmission es is fwd no lsd and no manual transmission and the is is clearly at the low end of the 3040k rangegreat value for the money with outstanding reliability great dealer service and good crash test results sighall entry lux cars are toys let me get this straight so i understand the conversation the acura tl is a toy but the honda v6 fullloaded for 7k less is plebian basic runofthemill appliance transportation the tsx which is the same price as the honda is a toy okay now i got it im not sure why its important that one believes there is a line in the sand between basic run of the mill appliance transportation and toy but im trying to understand the price at which toy becomes necessity in my mind anything more than a hyundia excel is a toy its just a matter of degree then the conversation becomes which toy is the most expensive fun to own most reliable etc so while i agree with you blueguy nobody needs a car like this its obvious that people want these types of cars its individual priority do you want your toy to be more practical or just insanely fun to play with but then again fun varies among each of uswhat kind how much how often then theres justgottohaveit factor my sister who drives at or under the speed limit and changes lane blocks or even miles before making a turn just has to have the tls she doesnt drive on the beltways and interstates and i mean absolutely never and never ventures into an unfamiliar area not without me as the driver but she wanted that navigation system and i guess its epidemic because now i just got to have a 330i  how much time do you spend inside your car at least now i cant get enough according to the mid the car and i were together for 10 hours on the first tank of gas such is life here in dc when the avg mph is in the low 20s in 60 highway driving the tl aspec is getting dangerously close to the price to the outthedoor price of a ctsv one of the folks on the cts board said he bought a v for 45k if thats true forget the aspec its not even close the message editor isnt working today keeps getting a pathname error guess id better proofread before i post my view of all new cars is that theyre luxury items we could all pick up a solid 67 year old accordcamryaltima for very little dough and itd serve the purpose a 99 civic dx would satsify most needs room for the dog awd ac leather etc are luxuries i have no delusions about my cars theyre not need based items they dont approach food or shelter on the scale of things one must have to survive i know very well that i can get by fine on an old nissan sedan as i did through college and many many years after it and 40k for a tl is outrageous the aspec package should be at most 3k over a standard tl still nothing i can find on the acura website id be really surprised if its almost 10k more unless it involves engine mods which i seriously doubt if anyone can find proof of pricing and post the link id appreciate it but for now im not believing the pricing until i hear it right from the manufacturer qbrozen just read the plethora of magazine articles that have appeared recently on the aspecs these type mods normally cost upwards of 5000 new tires wheels exterior trim pieces etc not to mention suspension pieces lexus tried something similar a couple years ago with the is and gs the ltuned spec i was about 34k and spec ii was around 56k it bombed in marketplace tuner types would rather do it themselves often for less or to be wilder nissan is trying same with nismo for sentra ser spec v and 350z not cheap nissan has stuned for street and rtuned for racing come on bmw offers the zhp package for 4k more than a base 330i with it you get m3 front endaero package 18 inch wheelsrims different

aspec tl still costs less than a comparably equipped zhp 330i jrock what are the exact upgrades of the aspec on the tl what the bmw costs is not relevant either were talking about a 32k car with x options tell us what those options are you decided to bring the bmw zhp package into the equation by comparing the relative value of the aspec package vs the zhp package basically your point is that the aspec is overpriced my point is that if youre going to compare it in that way ie compare it feature for feature the 330i is overpriced it may not be relevant to you but it is relevant to me and others frankly i agree with you i also think the aspec package is overpriced im not really interested in it but im sure that there is some site on the internet that lists what you get with the aspec package the price of aspec is 52k plus installation 700 it is overpriced with standard options of tl is more than enough msrp of tl 332k wo navi or 353k with navi jrock you decided to bring the bmw zhp package into the equation by comparing the relative value of the aspec package vs the zhp package basically your point is that the aspec is overpriced no i was not comparing the values of the two i merely pointed out to riez that a major manufacturer can cheaply add many many elements to a performance package at a price that isnt a 33 jump over the base my point is that if youre going to compare it in that way ie compare it feature for feature the 330i is overpriced it may not be relevant to you but it is relevant to me and others i was talking about whats added equipment wise x base whats added to it to get to z total the tl stickers for like 3233k loaded whatever theyre adding from what ive seen its an aero kit some suspensiontire mods and a tweaked exhaust its not nearly worth 10k were talking partsnot the value of the car even if the tl stickered at 25k as is and the aspec raised the price to 35k id be annoyed as the parts could be added aftermarket for that price and value is subjective at 25k i probably would have bought a tl 33k nope thats why they make different cars  because not everybody wants to drive one type of vehicle is not worth the money but tls are well worth sticker any day bmws on the other hand value is really subjective but usually overpriced item like the aspec will not sell well i myself will not buy an overpriced aspec and i think majority of people will not buy an overpriced item will you buy an overpriced item overpriced is entirely subjective in october 2000 the sony ps2 came out i bought up several and resold them in online auctions for 200300 over msrp the people buying them obviously felt the toy was worth 800900 because they bid up to that point im not going to tell them theyre wrong but what i valued and what they valued were different to somebody out there the aspec may be worth 40k hard to imagine but its possible just as its hard for some to imagine blowing 40k on a 3 series to each his own in the end shouldnt we buy that vehicle we feel most comfortable driving in the end shouldnt we buy that vehicle we feel most comfortable driving i was not saying about a car or 330i as an overpriced item unless you feel it that way of course and again aspec is not worth my dollars and you seemed to agree to it too i like jrocks objective opinions eventho sometimes we disagree if it is about a car then actually for 4 months i had been researching and comparing 330i gs300 es330 g35 and 325i no acura in my top list before i even knew about tl choosing car is a complicated issue you cant compare ones driving experience with the other you cant value tl for just 25k bcuz 6k peoplemonth would disagree while maybe only 467 people would agree to it you like the car the way you like it why we should care about others after market gadget is different than the original you can install them but you might destroy the cars harmony that is just my opinion i like 330i too peace  no i was not comparing the values of the two i merely pointed out to riez that a major manufacturer can cheaply add many many elements to a performance package at a price that isnt a 33 jump over the base aight my bad if that was your point objective opinions haha i didnt know that opinions could be objective but thanks for the support ive learned a great deal from these forums and threads like these and all the regulars that post here even though weve had our share of disagreements it rarely gets too personal here and ive seen many threads at other forums basically deteriorate into name calling part of it is the hardline police work of the moderators  when i was a teenager i used to think that only lexus made nice cars and everything else was junk ive evolved somewhat since then said that the tl aspec they drove had an msrp of 41893 so theres no question as to what it costs whether or not its worth it compared to the 330i  but at 42k its getting within a few grand of the ctsv a car that stomps a mud hole in it and the 330i for that matter danny reported a few posts back the aspec is 5900 installed a far cry from the 10k originally quoted that started this current discussion and if that autoweek number is correct thats a navi equipped unit correct i think that adds up 35k for the car and 5900 for the package  over 41k so can we now stop saying things like 45k for a tl 33 more 10k more etc at least until acura makes the numbers public or we have a more reliable source i see that motortrend has reported testing the aspec and they support the 5200install number according to them you get the following an aero kit that incorporates a front air dam small chin spoiler body side skirts and a choice of two different rear spoilersa small trunklid spoiler or a larger yet still tasteful rear wing the aero kit was windtunnel tested and produces more downforce while generating a slightly improved overall cd aspec badging flanks the body panels and the tls welltrimmed interior is left alone save for a recontoured slightly thicker racingstyle steering wheel more aggressive suspension tuning most visible are the 18x85inch alloy wheels and grippy 23540vr18 yokohama avs es100 tires the rest of the underpinning mods include a tracktuned shock and coilspring combo that lowers ride height by one inch special attention was paid to spring rate and shock valving to ensure sportier handling without the tradeoff of a harsh onhighway ride and some more tidbits from their article in aspec form both torque steer and understeer are dramatically reducedwe even experienced an occasional hint of oversteer on aggressive corner turnin braking performance from the factoryinstalled brembo fourpiston disc brakes improves too thanks to reduced nosedive during hard stops and the stickier rubber the aspec package was not only developed under acuras umbrella but the added cost 5200 plus installation can be rolled directly into the purchase or lease price finally the factory warranty remains unviolated and the numbers stock vs aspec\\nbraking 600 ft 141 119\\nslalom mph 625 661\\nskidpad g 077 083 now question does anyone have published numbers for a nonzhp 330 vs a zhp 330 and the total price difference now were not talking the peformance pack right no engine mods unless the engine mods and suspension mods come in around 6k do they no more time for me to search today so maybe someone can do that for me those numbers are atrocious 77 skidpad 141 feet braking from 60 now wonder these things are 31 loaded a ctsv is 50 large so its still more than a few grand from the 42k aspec tl and i know someone claims to have bought a ctsv for 45k but prove it not to mention that comparing street prices on one vehicle against sticker on another is certainly unfair just remember that is only one source interestingly enough cd got very close to those motortrend aspec numbers with their stock tl so interpret that how you will im willing to bet that motortrends stock numbers are a bit conservative and make that aspec package look way better than it is in real life a 06 improvement in skidpad is pretty incredible a 02 cds stock number vs motortrends aspec number seems much more realistic to me im going to prove someone paid 45k for a v get real i can see how it could be done gm card various other certificates that are available if you can find a dealer that will accept them looks like the guy that paid 45k may have done just that i also dont think autoweek makes up msrps the aspec is overpriced at the price point where autoweek tested it i would expect much better numbers as the tsx and the rsx are capable of those numbers hell the old integra could skidpad 77 imagine 2651845s on a g 9 skidpad would become 9598 or even 10 thats just tires put a 5100 package on the g coupe and run with the 911 put it on the g sedan and run with m class now question does anyone have published numbers for a nonzhp 330 vs a zhp 330 and the total price difference 3900thats the price difference bmw claimed the zhp dropped the zero to 60 numbers to 59 tests by mags get it lower v the official 65 of the 330i check bmwusacom for that ill have to do some digging for the numbers i know the slalom numbers were different too put a 5100 package on the g coupe and run with the 911 put it on the g sedan and run with m class that is a pipe dream youd better find another 100 or so hp for a g to run with any of the really serious factory sports sedans i think a g could run with an m3 without the extra hundred hphow about 50 point is spending 5100 bucks is doing little for the aspec tl to get it up to mid lux sedan expectations so the 3900 zhp package includes the engine mods of course you need those engine mods just to compete in straight lines with the stock tl but do those necessarily come with the improved suspension or can you get the suspension upgrades without the engine mods exactly my point we cant prove what that guy paid so the ctsv is 50k for points of this discussion and the aspec tl as far as we know is about 40k without navigation so thats 10k more for the ctsv read up on cds numbers  hell go back and read this discussion youll find several people have shown several times over that the stock tl numbers compare very favorably with the other cars we talk about here and it doesnt need the aspec package to do so according to a car and driver article ive readit seems that nismo nissans motorsports arm products might not offered for infiniti vehicles because of fears of tarnishing the luxury persona of the brand on the other hand nismo products will be avaible for popular nissan cars like the 350z it is a shame since the nismo tuned jdm skylines g35 are hellish machines hopefully nissan will see the light and allow car enthusiasts to purchase performance parts for their infinitis how do you italicize quoted sections of other posts thanks so the 3900 zhp package includes the engine mods everything i listed from exteriorinterior mods to engine modifications to suspension changes all come with a zhp package but do those necessarily come with the improved suspension or can you get the suspension upgrades without the engine mods its all one package the only optional items from the package are the trunk lip spoiler and getting leather over that stupid alcantara garbage it is a shame since the nismo tuned jdm skylines g35 are hellish machines hopefully nissan will see the light and allow car enthusiasts to purchase performance parts for their infinitis  if the 350z and the g are essentially the same except body panels  why wouldnt one be allowed to upgrade thier g with those nismos components just because the infiniti dealer wont be offering them doesnt mean they arent available in fact most of my work and parts supply come from nissan anyway if theres one thing the g has got its z and g enthusiasts galore and many many aftermarket suppliers of performance parts and it stems from the 350z guys who are nuts about performance nismo is only offering what is available elsewhere from other sometimes better suppliers ok thanks for the info considering all that seems like the performance package is a bargain when considered by itself and compared against other similar upgrades the jcw mini comes to mind type  i  without the spaces to start the italics and then   i  again no spaces at all to end them you can do the same thing with b instead of i for bold instead of italics and they can be used together if you want there are many html guides all over the web that any search engine will find for you if you want to go further its its not a matter of being allowed nismo makes performance packages tailored for specific cars like the 350z not to say you cant take a part from a nissan kit and use it on an infinitiwhat you wont be able to do is buy a nismo kit for say a g35 coupe although this package is available in japan you cant get it here again nissan feels that nismo takes away from the infiniti image i think its silly and i hope nissan reconsiders the rather high cost of the zhp aspec and ltuned are just another factor in the value equation none of them are really worth it they just dont give you that much for the money much of the aspec and ltuned were for nonperformance things like exterior changes guess that is why i bought an is300 manual could get a reliable fun car for about 30000 and it had hid and lsd heck id rather have a 30000 325i sport 5speed manual than a 40000 330i zhp then id use the 10000 to buy myself a muscle car say amc amx or javelin i agree with riez on that why we should buy a performance package for a sedan if you are really into performance go with the two seater its better than buying performance package which doesnt perform 060 59 the aspec which is mainly only stability  body makeup sedan always have the luxury part with too much performance nobody cant even see it its too fast the rather high cost of the zhp aspec and ltuned are just another factor in the value equation none of them are really worth it guess its all a matter of priorities i know for a fact i could get the engine interiorexterior suspension and tire mods for 4k its impossible just the differential swap would be a hassle new cams headers ecu and exhaust heck id rather have a 30000 325i sport 5speed manual than a 40000 330i zhp different worlds thats like comparing a cts to a ctsv or a mustang v6 to an svt yes its a two second difference and the entire character of the car is different my biggest concern with the packages is that that 5k you add up front will pretty much be worth nothing when you go to sell the car sure some here or there will know what it means and want to pay more but most likely you will eat that cost either way would love to have the package but the cost is pretty high do it yourself and dont pay someone to make mods to your car or do them one at time maybe some will want the body packages and the aspec buyers will be there for those who just want a newer looking or cooler looking car all the performance stuff anyone can do anywhere without much help the funnest thing of owning a g has been minor tweaks and little money that create small incrimental gains that i can notice and tweak do one and then do another down the road while appreciating each tweak on its own is my philosophy i would suggest most of us would rather buy the car without a perf pack and make the mods ourselves the zhp is an exception as it offers some big changes to a luxo car to get it to be alot differet for 200 bucks i added 1014 hp with an intake for another 120 i added no real gains with my hyper grounding kit but added much smoothness and better responsiveness while eliminating the gurgle the intake created for another 450 i bought a crawford z car intake plenum which adds 20hp so for less than 1k i got about 2025 hp at peak increased the sound quality of the motor get better gas mileage 45 mpg have a smoother idle and start up and i dont have the hp drop at 6000 if they offered a 6000 nismo package i say no do the perf mods myself and save 5000 on body kit bolt ons that will never work out as well as if bolted on at the plant in the first place now i belive i am running z power at the crank anyway  weight diff is about 150 anyone see the z in the lastest cd they got a 138 14 running stock at 102 or so everytime they test the fm seems faster and faster break in alone is good for 20hp id bet with the vq i am of two minds on this one in most cases i would be inclined to buy the base car and then tweak it myself most likely after the manufacturers warranty expired that said between the 325i and the 330i and again between the 330i and the 330i zhp one would be hard pressed to match the full package of the more expensive car for the same money to say nothing of having a factory warranty on the extra goodies so in the case of the 3series id be more inclined to go with the factory upgrade best regards\\nshipo another funny thing about the 330i to zhp switch its really a crazy number of mods for only 2800 if one were to buy a 330i and get the sports package 1200 well apparently the zhp package is popular enough that theyre putting it on the coupe and convertible as well im not sure why infiniti is nixing nismo especially since theyre going for the japanese bmw image everything rwd or awd handling a priority etc most boy racer kids wont be able to afford it anyway okay fair enough i hadnt considered that the difference between the 330i sp and the 330i zhp was considerably less than just the cost of the zhp as such i went through and configured the three as i would have ordered them 325i 5speed metallic paint leather pp sp harmon kardon 36595\\n330i 6speed metallic paint pp sp xenon 41570\\n330i 6speed metallic paint zhp leather moon roof xenon 43470 so in the as i would buy it configuration the 330i comes at a 4975 premium fairly substantial however imho the considerable power gain coupled with the 6speed transmission bigger brakes and bigger wheels and tires easily justify the price then there is the 330i to 330i zhp difference of only 1900 a nobrainer on a car listing at over 40k best regards\\nshipo heres the quote from the april 2004 cd things are getting complicated at nismo nissans motorsports and tuning arm so far the us distributor has been shipped more than 700 sets of high performance suspension wheel and exhaust packages for the 350z and ideally the company would like to send the same sport goodies for the infiniti g35 coupe known as the nissan skyline coupe in japanbecause hey this nismo skyline developed together with sonys gran turismo people looks pretty damn good the problem is that in the us the car is an infiniti not a nissan as it is in japan and the us marketing types feel that nismo parts might not suit the upscale brand image shipo your numbers point out the lack of value at the high end of the 3 series youre looking at 41600 and 43500 for 330i that is just way too expensive with gm car rebates financing deals credit card rebates etc that ctsv might be less out of pocket than your zhp think id rather have an 530i sport manual with limited options or a cpo 540i6 just looked over the consumer reports 2004 annual auto issue is300 still a great deal great value a ton of car for the money fantastic reliabilitypast present and future outstanding safety assessment great car new or used 3 series still lags in reliability g35 better but not quite there tl too new to tell that is just way too expensive with gm car rebates financing deals credit card rebates etc that ctsv might be less out of pocket than your zhp think id rather have an 530i sport manual with limited options or a cpo 540i6 a cts  caddy  id rather be dead than own a gm seriously they could offer a 600 hp engine in the best handling chassis ever and i will not own it or a ford b 530i 6 speed  big and a sticker with sports package and xenon of 49k thatd be 49k for a slower less responsive larger car c 545i 6 speed  is it even out yet  59k without any options 59k or 39khmm thats an easy call yes my car had a 43k msrp lets assume you can get 4k off a 545i so itd still be 55k 16k difference i dont know what you have against gm but the ctsv is just the best car in its class period ctsv is just the best car in its class period the cts has one of the worst reliability records in its class so far what makes you think the ctsv will be any better a lot of good 400 horses will do you when the car is sitting in a service bay any reasonable thinking person would think twice before plunking down 50 large for a car whose reliability record will never come close to japanese standards plus on a personal note i cant stand the look of it inside or out dont know what you have against gm but the ctsv is just the best car in its class period its an american car for one secondly its a gm from there id move on to the look at me batman meets legos exterior and searsgrade interior i havent driven the ctsv yet but given the way the original cts was a lumbering wallowing boat i flat out do not believe any review written about it the mags praised that trash heap when it hit the street and i gotta say handling wise it didnt hold a candle to any japanese or german in the class from the is to the a4 on they all outclassed the cts in handling some day ill drive one but even if its the greatest driving vehicle ive been in which ill admit to i wont buy one simply because its a gm a cts  caddy  id rather be dead than own a gm seriously they could offer a 600 hp engine in the best handling chassis ever and i will not own it or a ford the caddy is compelling but with chassis hopping launches and some quality issues its not the m5 beater it could someday become angular is hard to take but bangle gives that to us now too i never gave two cruds about ford but the gt sure is unaffordably cool and the shelby cobra very interested to see what becomes of that hopefully not limited editioned and 40k premiumed too bad the 3040 k cars from ford blow i havent driven the ctsv yet but given the way the original cts was a lumbering wallowing boat i flat out do not believe any review written about it lumbering wallowing boat bwahaha a sillier statement i have not read in some time so have we driven a cts for ourselves im guessing not heres the bottom line the ctsv will annhilate any one of these also rans its in a complete other world as a performance car and i hope you didnt pay 43k for that weak bmw you got screwed if you did they could offer a 600 hp engine in the best handling chassis ever and i will not own it or a ford a poseur if there ever was one blueguydotcom not sure why you have such an animus against detroit i really dont care where a good car is built i just try to buy affordable fun cars the ctsv appears to be a ton of car for the money you might not want to check out the latest cr they pound mb audi jaguar land rover mini and vw for poor reliability and they cite the a6 and 7 series as repeat offenders they list the 7 series 9799 and 0002 and x5 0002 as used cars to avoid the 3 series now has average reliability which is an improvement so they can now recommend it is that damning with faint praise but bmw cant hold a candle to infiniti or lexus not sure why anyone would want a 4043k 330i instead of an m3 they are too close in price to favor the loaded 330i the germans are spewing out far more unreliable crap than detroit these days and of the big 25 the worst is chrysler we know who owns them not sure why you have such an animus against detroit i really dont care where a good car is built i just try to buy affordable fun cars absolutely sometimes i think my goal is to have owned one of everything before im through amazing now chrysler is spewing about unreliable crap because of their connection with a german company as if they never did before the americans win 2 points over the germans in cr and now the germans are spewing out far more unreliable crap typical over stating of any and everything as usual of gm rhetoric why are we even talking about the ctsv here of course it will easily whip all these sedans at the track m why are we even talking about the ctsv here of course it will easily whip all these sedans at the track isnt the cts and its variants a near luxury performance sedan the americans win 2 points over the germans in cr and now the germans are spewing out far more unreliable crap powers got em a lot worse than that almost all of the germans are now under the below average line some close to bottom feeders sooo is chrysler spewing out crap before an excuse for them doing it now dcs certainly had plenty of time to get them straightened out ah we have quite a battle going on here all i can say is remember 1980 i had little hope that the american hockey team would beat the russians but we were glued to the tv i havent had an american car since the 70s but ive been clinging to that hope and am rooting hard fact is americans are showing signs go get em riez so have we driven a cts for ourselves im guessing not i clearly wrote i have driven a cts a manual in fact it was priced at nearly 40k and god it was awful every corner the front end would dip and the car would rock and undulate on entry and exit from said corner ive not experienced a worse handling combatant in the near luxury segment there isnt a german or japanese competitor  including the es  that should be worried when the salesperson asked how i liked it i straightforwardly told him the handling was insanely soft and not near the levels of refinement in german sport sedans his intelligent rejoinder this is a caddy yeah some things never change heres the bottom line the ctsv will annhilate any one of these also rans its in a complete other world as a performance car and i hope you didnt pay 43k for that weak bmw you got screwed if you did i never pay sticker but then again it shocks me people would pay 35k let alone 4045k for a vette to each his own to me the caddy is scraping the bottom of the barrel a poseur if there ever was one that makes no sense im a poseur because i refuse to line the coffers of companies i want to go out of business id say if i bought from fordgm id lose tremendous face as i have lobbied hard for them to go under and will not go back on my word i bought a new dodge durango in 1989 first american vehicle i have ever owned it has 115000 miles on it and i have not had a single problem i know that is atypical but i think it shows that you can get a good or bad anything\\nthe 59 v8 has been great the chrysler v12 that has been at the auto shows looks very interesting\\ni also own an 04 tl which my wife drives and i have always owned acura passenger cars\\ni think the numbers on quality in cr show that america is getting there many of the japanese vehicles are made here also i would always but american if i could but they are not there yet blueguydotcom not sure why you have such an animus against detroit i really dont care where a good car is built i just try to buy affordable fun cars the ctsv appears to be a ton of car for the money to each his own its american i will not put my money there you might not want to check out the latest cr they pound mb audi jaguar land rover mini and vw for poor reliability and they cite the a6 and 7 series as repeat offenders they list the 7 series 9799 and 0002 and x5 0002 as used cars to avoid with good reason i never said germans build reliable cars never the 3 series now has average reliability which is an improvement so they can now recommend it is that damning with faint praise i didnt buy my car for reliability and frankly knew going in my bmw would probably be troublesome which it hasnt been didnt much care as i bought the car i felt the best driving but bmw cant hold a candle to infiniti or lexus\\nfor reliability thats true but that played no part in my buying decision ive owned other german cars that were a nightmare ill keep coming back as theyre just more entertaining not sure why anyone would want a 4043k 330i instead of an m3 they are too close in price to favor the loaded 330i 1 m3 is a 2 door i will not own a 2 door unless its a convertible if there were a 4 door m id buy it 2 m3 with the bare essentials xenon and moonroof stickers at 50k 50k for a car thats a design i dont like and doesnt offer the utility i desire no thanks to each his own its american i will not put my money there so blueguydotcom i see you have an american flag next to your name are you an american i share blueguydotcoms distate for american cars ive owned gm product and i think its the biggest piece of garbage made german cars are quirky but they are a lot more fun to drive than their american or japanese counterparts blue my question is if your beloved beemer starts giving you the same headaches that your vw gave you would bad mouth bmw as much you do vwaudi what would be nextmercedes speedracer\\nblueguydotcom is nothing more than a poseur who will chase the prettiest foreign hood ornament he obviously doesnt really care about quality or performance since he has clearly stated that he wont buy certain makes even if they are clearly superior in these areas i also dont believe hes ever been in a cts since his spew is completely contrary to every professional review but then again it shocks me people would pay 35k let alone 4045k for a vette more reinforcement  blueguydotcom doesnt really care about performance only the hood ornament he just doesnt get it my question is if your beloved beemer starts giving you the same headaches that your vw gave you would bad mouth bmw as much you do vwaudi what would be nextmercedes i probably would never buy a mercedes as for bmw going bad ive actually done my best to talk people out of buying bmws ask my broinlaw i took him out to look at cars one weekend and when i was positive he was going for the 325i i made it crystal clear that bmws arent very well made have bad electricals and in my experience really bad transmissions i did everything i could to scare him back toward infinitiacuralexus didnt work as he bought a 325i should my bmw go really bad  like my jetta  it will confirm what i expect of it so far its been lightyears more reliable and troublefree

ownned knock on wood have had no problems with it on the cts never driven it i have nothing against it except that imo it is ugly as sin be careful not to get personal folks debate the cars all you want but leave the personal slams for another place thanks blueguydotcom is nothing more than a poseur who will chase the prettiest foreign hood ornament thats funny pat generally doesnt roll with personal attacks lets leave it at i drove just about every car available before buying my vehicle and i bought entirely based on fitting my needs and desires  speed handling rwd manual free maintenance 4 doors he obviously doesnt really care about quality or performance since he has clearly stated that he wont buy certain makes even if they are clearly superior in these areas a i dont care about quality youre right ive owned american japanese and german cars so obviously quality isnt the main consideration when buying b why is this a tough concept if one has sworn to do something then one stands by it ive sworn never to buy an american car i either compromise my integrity break my word or i follow through i choose to stand by my word no cars with american nameplates i also dont believe hes ever been in a cts since his spew is completely contrary to every professional review may 3 2002 at marvin k brown cadillac i took a cts for a test drive consisting of surface streets and freeways blueguydotcom infiniti g35 vs bmw 330i may 4 2002 248pm the car was a mess much like the dealership more reinforcement  blueguydotcom doesnt really care about performance only the hood ornament he just doesnt get it if that were so id have bought a vette as isnt that the ultimate car for people want desperately to be noticed  beyond the hummme 2 forgive me for not wanting a vehicle that cries to me middle aged balding man with a penchant for gold chains according to car  drivers road test results the 400hp ctsv will do 060 mph in 52 secs but the 270hp tl stock will do it in 57 secs theres at least 100 horses going to waste here that to me is not performance just lousy engineering you think a tl can take an m5 on the track a ctsv can this aint drag racing go buy a muscle car with a stick axle if you want to do that yeah the testers of the ctsv had an overheated engine and admitted they couldnt launch the car hard 060 is not where this car will shine for 0100 and 50130 the cts will make the acura look like a gremlin running on 5 cylinders no tires in the world will get the cts power to the ground for a clean 060 launch 305s maybe the ctsv with all its quirks and angles is possibly the best bang for buck out there and it eats similary priced bmws alive in germanys proving track if the ctsv raced a tl it would need radar to find it again you think a tl can take an m5 on the track a ctsv can correct but so can an evo for 20k less so what actually id like to see a race between an m5 and a ctsv by professional drivers that would be interesting instead of comparing numbers on paper the ctsv with all its quirks and angles is possibly the best bang for buck out there and it eats similary priced bmws alive in germanys proving track  except its a dead heat to 60 for the three series which can get there in 56 except for the m3 which can get there in about 5 seeing as how the v has over a hundred horse advantage to the 3 series so what given the m5 has a half second advantage for the same hp so what im not dissing the v but if all you want is speed and evo for 20k less is the ticket if all you are looking at is hp the v is the ticket i compared a 400hp car with a 270hp car the performance differences should be major but they are not from an engineering standpoint the ctsv is a dog and the cts is a dog with fleas i compared a 400hp car with a 270hp car the performance differences should be major but they are not gee have you put a tl on a track with a ctsv no one i know of has lets throw out a few 060 numbers and make some silly assumptions from an engineering standpoint the ctsv is a dog and the cts is a dog with fleas what does that make the m5 then i will agree with the person before that the ctsv has no place in these discussions it is a sports sedan with a little luxury thrown in and is priced a good deal over all the others discussed here m3 has no place in this discussion either most people are not cross shopping these cars how many average joe car buyers get to use their cars on the track 060 timeswith the traffic the way it is id be lucky if i can make it from 020 mph without slamming on the brakes unless you are street racing the 3 second difference between car a and car b isnt going to amount to much in the real world it all boils down to preference and what rocks you boat im missing it what exactly do you have against the american nameplates if reliability doesnt concern you then what is it you said even if they made the most powerful best handling car youd still not buy it why i gotta go test drive a ctsv and see what the hoopla is about the main reason i didnt was because of questions of reliability exterior styling and interior styling well its a first generation product and at least caddy put it out there hope lexus and infiniti have the guts to do the same acura cant really make a serious performance version based on the tl if they keep making it fwd may 3 2002 at marvin k brown cadillac i took a cts for a test drive consisting of surface streets and freeways then youre the worst car reviewer in the world because no professional reviewer agrees with you of course with statements like seriously they could offer a 600 hp engine in the best handling chassis ever and i will not own it there is zero credibility there anyway how many average joe car buyers get to use their cars on the track people that buy the supersedans are not joe car buyer a lot of them do get raced i will agree with the person before that the ctsv has no place in these discussions it is a sports sedan with a little luxury thrown in and is priced a good deal over all the others discussed here actually the differnce could very well be just a few thousand dollars if youve got a bunch of gm card points most people are not cross shopping these cars if the diff is only a few bucks why wouldnt you people that buy the supersedans are not joe car buyer a lot of them do get raced you are right they are not joe car buyer they are joe car buyer with a lot of moneybut just because they have the money to spend does not make them track racers anyway if i was serious about racing i wouldnt buy a luxury sedan anyway since leather nav systems stereos ac units add weight to a car and would take away from the cars performance you race cars in your class whatever your class happens to be having the luxury items doesnt really matter seeing what itll do without having to watch out for the cops does and you get to learn that youre not really that good of a driver  i compared a 400hp car with a 270hp car the performance differences should be major but they are not what part of the equation are you missing the cars are not in any way going to perform similarly except for 030 maybe once the v get rolling it will make the the extra 15k over the tl seem trivial the fact you think a tl can even be compared to a pushrod v8 also put in a vette does not say much for anything other than your undying devotion to the tl im missing it what exactly do you have against the american nameplates if reliability doesnt concern you then what is it you said even if they made the most powerful best handling car youd still not buy it why i admit a severe distate for american styling engineering marketing and everything else associated with american cars im biased and prefer foreign cars then youre the worst car reviewer in the world because no professional reviewer agrees with you of course with statements like seriously they could offer a 600 hp engine in the best handling chassis ever and i will not own it there is zero credibility there anyway golly if a guy in a magazine  you know the organizations that sell advertising to the companies whose products they review  say its so then it must be what ever happened to thinking and experiencing for yourself what some paid off hack has to say about a vehicle has no bearing on how i will react to the same vehicle think for yourself i admit a severe distate for american styling engineering marketing and everything else associated with american cars im biased and prefer foreign cars so why exactly should we believe anything you post about them golly if a guy in a magazine  you know the organizations that sell advertising to the companies whose products they review considering the car companies all advertise in the mags and ive seen unflattering reviews of just about every make just where is the bias it must all be a big conspiracy i dont care for american cars either save for either the dodge viper or maybe the fort gt there is no american car i aspire to own i think its just a matter of taste like flavors of ice cream i think you are taking blues dislike for american cars too personally i can honestly say i dont care where my car comes from or what marque it is if it is affordable and fun to drive that is all that counts smiles on my face couldnt care what my neighbors think and ive owned a ton of different cars i love european and japanese cars traded in my two bmws for two lexus but before that i had owned two infiniti and the very first car i bought was an 85 jetta and i dont short detroit i loved my 96 impala ss and my 00 lincoln ls v8 sport my 97 camaro v6 5speed manual with perfhand pkg lsd etc my 95 plymouth neon 5speed manual and my 93 chrysler concorde perfhand pkg i love my current 00 hyundai sonata v6 5speed manual wabstc which i use for commuting and short work trips after 50000 miles reliable as a top heck i even loved my 89 metro 91 swift 92 tracer wagon i was poor but then if you love to drive and drive a lot almost any car can be funas long as it meets your needs and circumstances cookie jar still not full blueguy whats your theory about this will a would be imola red zhp be more in the crosshairs of a trooperss radar than any other silver gray or titanium gray\\nincidentally whats your zhp color so why exactly should we believe anything you post about them what do you mean by believe were writing opinions in here theres nothing to believe when i use facts i cite them otherwise its all subjective you like the ctsv isnt that good enough i accept people dislike bmw for various reasons  some i think are right on others that raise my eyebrow wouldnt the world be boring if we all agreed good grief wed drive accords eat at places like outback steakhouse and watch only films by tom hanks man i have no idea if that holds true about red cars talk to people with red cars i have the silvergray httpblueguycomimagesfront_rightjpg if the diff is only a few bucks why wouldnt you  this discussion is about entry level luxurysport sedans the ctsv starts at 50k that is a little bit above the 30k cars we are discussing cant really discuss what ifs about points and discounts because that varies way too much from person to person if they were just a couple hundred bucks different as almost all the cars we are discussing are then heck yeah i would probably line up for one if i could get over the exterior that is just because it is based on a entry level car does not mean it should be compared to these other cars i have platinum and the nc trooper nor his laser last sunday could care less what color my g was i think you are taking blues dislike for american cars too personally i dont think so but its nice to see you dont completely dismiss domestics for no good reason id never make the mistake of dismissing anyone you never know when and where something good is going to come from this discussion is about entry level luxurysport sedans the ctsv starts at 50k that is a little bit above the 30k cars we are discussing wasnt there just a discussion of a 43k bmw and 42k acura in here main discussion is about the normal cars most will not be going for these special editions plus 78k is still 20 more for a caddy v sounds like its time for a good radar detector got the valentine one but laser is still tough to see ahead of time  i think its instant on and it has to be on you to detect the only time my v1 went off for laser and i had time to slow down i was right behind another guy that got tagged and there was about 3 seconds to spare on the same trip this weekend the guy in front of me was tagged  got nailed and i never heard a bliplaser is bad and more departments are spending the  the best if you dont mind paying 300 valentine one the rest i have a cobra forgot the modeldoes the job havent gotten a ticket since cost around 40 yeap with laser you gotta hope that somebody is getting clocked before you are so your detector can pick it upif you are ahead of the pack and cant see the trooper you are toast eaton53 you are taking blueguydotcoms distaste for american cars too personally as he said it is just his opinion  hes not trying to convince you that hes right you and he just see things differently take it easy okay valentineim always so tempted to spring for one as i drive 90 miles a day to and from work i just blew 500 bucks on new rear tires so right now im not real enthused about spending more for a car i hear the jammers are the way to go the v1 is great for all that is available in a detector now that still means laser kills us in our speedy sedans forget the fancy equipment watch out for the two lines on the pavement forget the fancy equipment watch out for the two lines on the pavement huh two lines on the pavement you want real fancy equipment one of those infrared light changers i could never use one  id feel too guilty if it ever got anyone hurt  but ive heard theyre crazy it makes driving surface streets a breeze i know this seems out of place and i do apologize to everyone and the host if it is i raise the comparative reliability issue here because this thread compares near luxury sedans made by germany bmw mb and audi japan g35 and tl and the us cadillac in any event i cant seem to locate an appropriate thread which discusses this and so here i go  as most of you may be aware the april issue of consumer report states that us made cars are more reliable than german made cars but are not yet equal to those made by the japanese what do the german car lovers have to say about this could cr possibly be bowing to political pressure in upgrading the reliability of domestic cars to promote their sales in an effort to jump start the us economy and the long slump in domestic car sales is it really true that american made cars now are more reliable than the venerable german counterparts is the cady better than the bmw and mb i know cady probably could beat audi in terms of reliabilty  what do the german car lovers have to say about this could cr possibly be bowing to political pressure in upgrading the reliability of domestic cars to promote their sales in an effort to jump start the us economy and the long slump in domestic car sales is it really true that american made cars now are more reliable than the venerable german counterparts is the cady better than the bmw and mb i know cady probably could beat audi in terms of reliabilty   i dont think cr is fudging and i wouldnt be shocked if american cars are more reliable than german makes remember mbs reliability has slipped massively since they merged with chrysler vws consistently ranked down around the korean brands bmws plagued by electrical problems  all their stupid gadgets on the 5 and 7 only serve to drag down the companys reliability scores my broinlaws 745i is a fun car to drive but all that junk is bound to go wrong he asked me if id want his 7 in 2006 and i laughed because the upkeep on the rolling super computer would be more expensive than just about any other car around isnt the cts and its variants a near luxury performance sedan  yes the cts is a near luxury performance sedan but the ctsv isnt neither is the c32 s4 or m5 its so easy to bring up a car that will easily beat the rest just to bang on the gm drum the cts in its basic form cant do squat with the 330i or g35 and now tl powers got em a lot worse than that almost all of the germans are now under the below\\naverage line some close to bottom feeders thats more of the same survey harping that seems to have infected this board you like others believe that gm cars are all around better now because they have less problems forget all other aspects about the vehiclehey they dont break down as often anymore whatever no there is no excuse for chrysler quality problems but to sit there and say its because of the daimler side of the house is beyond ridiculous when theyve had the problem for years i supposed gm has done right by saab too right always skewing the facts to fit the current theme that is the gm fans way one minute well read how the ctsv is so hot that it sells for sticker and then the next its being bought for 45k m ahno cr bows to no one when they say the ctss firstyear reliability has been poor i believe them httpwwwconsumerreportsorgmaincontentdisplay_reportjspfo lder3c3efolder_id402631assortment3c3east_id389451 bmuid1078916491036 pretty surprising infiniti ranked number one over lexus in the 2001 and 1999 cars category the latter by a significant amount offtopic but also notable is hyundai reliability improving a great deal wouldnt be surprised if their reliability rivals the japanese big 3 in a few more years mercedes languishing in the back as usual sooner or later its going to catch up to them and people will really start equating their cars with poor reliability if not already they can only rest on the threepointed star for so long the reason we shouldnt raise the discussion to the level of a 50k car is because then someone else will come along and say here is this funmobile at only 55k and then the next person says hey this one is only 60k and so on and so on until we really are reduced to comparing the m5 to the is300 so the line needs to be somewhere yes the tl and 330 can be optioned out above 40k but they start far below that as already pointed out both pontiac and buick have made significant gains on the reliability scale whereas lincoln and cadillac move in the opposite direction as with bmw its also interesting to see how bmw rises up from below average in the new car category 2003 to above average in the used car categories 2001  1999 or maybe its in the same spot but the other makes are falling  infiniti and lexus are thw two top imo for reliability i pay to own and when i plunk down 35 large id like to at least have the opportunity to own the car for 7 years and then decide if its fun and reliable enough to keep for a second car what are the odds of that happening with the chevy 93 vector or the bmw 3 series or the a4 or the caddy with infiniti i honestly believe i may have a shot of going 10 years thats 5 years of no payment or one hell of an upgrade in 57 only the lexus and tl would cross my mind as possible long term ownership possibities if you there was a million dollar cannonball run across the us what car would you want from this category id take a g or hummer editof course the nissan crank sensor recall had better be checked or you may get strandeddidnt affect my car in reality if you dont like current american offerings for their styling and performance then that is obviously a valid reason not to buy any but you did say that you will never buy one no matter what they produce that really doesnt support your reasons because they may produce something that you find appealing in every way possible but according to you you still wont buy one just because of its nameplate thats very shallow of you but hey whatever floats your boat but just as long as you realize you are being completely superficial and dont kid yourself that you are boycotting it for any other reason dont get me wrong i also avoid the americans at this point in time although we were very close to buying a trailblazer last year but i am always open to their new offerings and would love to see them back in the game with something exciting and reliable id take a g or hummer g sure hummer not a chance reliability issues still plague this beast h2 is worse not to mention that you would have to be escorted by a fuel tanker ill take my chances in a toyota land cruiser thank you very much good choice but not fast enough the best cannonball was done in like 36 hours you have to have a sports car or superfast sedan or a police car or ambulance or something stealty the real cannonballers with cars and trucks alike usually used additional fule storage tanks the g puts the stock tank under the rear seat so there could be a modification that allowed for more storagehmmm also the intake plenum upgrade i did got me to about 28 mpg on the hiway great mod ps the cars that have won cannoballs include a caddy so the sedan thing is a good possibility in our little hypothetical if the ran one today youd spend 100k to mod the car strip all chrome install laser jammers and radio equipment  gps  fuel storage waste too engine mods and lighting and suspensionjeez it could never happen again i for one cant believe that the hummer h2 that uses mainly proven offtheshelf gm truck parts is so unreliable does anyone have any specifics as to what is so unreliable about this truck or are you all making big assumptions is is this 6000lb truck being knocked in a reliability survey again because of its fuel economy like last year or are their some real problems with it this time around m in that case ill take a porsche cayenne  cr reports that firstyear reliability is poor and you just answered your own question by stating that the hummer h2 uses mainly offtheshelf gm truck parts nuff said btw fuel economy is not one of the categories cr uses to rate these vehicles on reliability but what im trying to find out is what is so problematic with the h2 any specifics youre right it was jdp that knocked the h2 for fuel economy forgive me im not a survey clutcher so i get them mixed up at times i couldnt remember which sermon on andor which day i heard it m heres just one of many examples youll find on the net httpwwwhummerlemoncompictures2htm you still wont buy one just because of its nameplate thats very shallow of you but hey whatever floats your boat it is im a total bigot when it comes to american cars shrug we all have our failings but just as long as you realize you are being completely superficial and dont kid yourself that you are boycotting it for any other reason one reason i want them to go out of business but i am always open to their new offerings and would love to see them back in the game with something exciting and reliable thats where you and i part ways im open to new things and if they make a great car id admit to it but the big caveat id prefer if they just disappeared like amc amc didnt disappear they just got absorbed by chrysler and the cherokee is still being made and sold to this day so i think they deserve some credit for what they developed ok granted i would never buy a cherokee made these days but thats beside the point what was that amc bubble car they made called again boy was that a piece i must say that when it comes to reliability i would have to look at lexus\\n                    \\ni am not the type of person that will stay loyal to one car manufacturer i am always open to new or improved models from different companies there have been various types of vehicles that have been driven by either my wife and i or my parents over the last 10yrs  clk430ls400rx300es300thunderbirdfirebird grand amaudi a6g35coupe best in terms of quality and reliability  ls400 this car was driven hard for about 70k and there were no mechanical problems and no rattles or squeaking noises like what came with my clk430g35coupe\\n \\nanother endorsement for lexus the rx300 has 186000 miles with no major problems other than routine maintenance lets take a look at some of the others 89 firebird purchased used i had several expensive problems until i finally sold the money pit and used the proceeds for a down payment on my wifes wedding ring i guess the wife won that battle 94 thunderbirdwhat can i say other than crap it died at 76k too many problems to list clk430 had its share of rattles and fuse shortages it was handed in with 80k and a transmission problem thank god it was a lease g35coupe it only has 8k but the minor squeaks from different areas in the car can be annoying at times i am very happy with the car but we just did not have these issues with any of the lexus vehicles listed above audi a6 let me state the positive first it handled very well in the snow better than any other vehicle i have driven including the rx300 unfortunately the car is the definition of what a lemon is can anyone say fuse out the same fuse went out 3 times the car also failed to start on atleast 34 occasions the first happened at a funeral what timing the list goes on but i think my point is made yes i agree if you want a sport sedan you should look somewhere else other than lexus but when it comes to well made reliable cars i would have to give lexus 1st last place would have be a tie between audi and ford for me one reason i want them to go out of business brilliant and that would have a positive effect on the economy wouldnt it hopefully the same thing doesnt happen to your companybusiness that wouldnt be so good if you lost your job but if the largest employers in the country went under youd be happy american money is pretty good though isnt it nmp  not my problem lay off the politics okay this is a car forum everybodys got a theory some wwii veterans would not buy anything german or japanesethats their perrogative albeit i probably understand a war veterans reasoning better than blues just a bit of common sense as long as things are going your way then its not your probem and thats good for you but you do like the american dollar and the freedom of choice\\n         my apologies to the group for interjecting my nonsense into the discussion nothing personal i just have strong feelings about the subject matter and it has nothing to do with  buy american if detroit went what would that mean for ford of europe ford of australia opel holden saab jaguar aston martin volvo and other whollyowned international subsidiaries of ford and gm not to mention their partially ownedcompanies like mazda suzuki isuzu etc perish the thought but i may be different i was a huge fan of the recent merkur coupe  sedan ford of europe and capri convertible ford of australia flops as well as someone who loved the old opel manta and mercury capri from the 1970s i just pray buyers in all those overseas markets arent so hostile to foreign us companies that have been on their soil for say 5080 years thinking in europe ford and gm go back to around 1930 ford was a huge player in japan before ww ii as long as as car companies in this country earn less return on capital than a cd then perhaps it would help the economy for said capital to be put to use in a higher earning return investmentall these arguments can be offset and counterargued it ends with a job outsourcing discussion and ultimately protectionism discussion every timeavoid it blueguy doesnt want auto employees to lose thier jobs he wants them to simply know that he wont be buying from them and perhaps he like many will never consider a car from this country after a 1982 buick regal i have tended to agree and take my money to germany and japan perhaps the big 3 employess should avoid the inevitable and try some community college courses anti american car sentimnent from americans is rampant unereasable and justified in many cases chris  blueguy doesnt want auto employees to lose thier jobs he wants them to simply know that he wont be buying from them and perhaps he like many will never consdider a car from this country he might not intend the consequences of his statements but what he wrote is quite different the line was crossed for appropriate car discussions lets get back on topic the cts v will whoop on an a6 27 s4 bmw 545 s60 r and several others in this relative size and price range  imo i dont care who or which country that make the car as long as it meets my requirement then its fine why people keep comparing a 57 litre engine with 30 litre engine 50k vs 3040k what about the 36 ctsv which is more makes sense there is always something that we dont like either its about the look reliability performance luxury etc for 50k i would go with lexusbmw and maybe the future model of rl need to see it first thou its a blunt attempt to make a car with performance only without considering other aspects however when you say i want an american car companyford or whomever  to go out of business the line between car discusion passion and financial political discussion gets crossed as a passionate car lover im speaking from a purely emotional level i feel the same way about steven spielberg microsoft mcdonalds and a host of other franchisescompanies that represent qualities i dislike of course on a business school bottomline side i totaly understand the economic ramifications created by voiding any of these moneymakers the ardent capitalist side screams make money any way you can sell them a box of rocks fro 1000 and call it mars diamonds the cold business school trained analytical side tends to scare more people than the emotional side if i could stamp out substandard products at half the cost of my competitors and lure more people into buying my products for multi billion dollar profits i would back to our regularly scheduled program squabbling about the performance of a 50k entry level luxury sedan the spielberg movie always use ford vans for talent transportation to shoots d lets stick to the cars and leave the political views out of this  whether you define some subjects as political or not we are not here to talk about the american economy antiamerican sentiment hostility towards american makes etc please get back to the cars and again lets keep our conversation relevant to our subject i would really appreciate that regarding near luxury performance sedans as a point of reference i drive a 2002 530i 5speed with enough extra goodies to have brought the msrp up to nearly 49000 that said i got a good deal and did the european delivery thing which resulted in a final price of just south of 43000 that of course does not count the cost of the european trip but i would have taken it anyway and rented a car while i was there from my point of view my car completely meets my needs wants and desires its fun to drive economical 31 mpg on the highway reliable two years old and no unscheduled trips to the dealership good looking inside and out luxurious certainly fast enough to get my attention and capable enough to deal with its power and ability to go fast what do i mean by that last bit on the autobahn during my ed trip i was tooling along at the speed limiter 1285 mph when a motorcycle pulled out directly in front of me doing something like 60 mph i performed an emergency lane change unfortunately when he saw me in the mirror he did the same keeping him directly in my sights and then performed what could best be described as an anchor dropping test of the brakes at our closest we only got within two feet of each other him under full acceleration and me in panic stop mode so he still had a little margin for his error and as such he lived for another day hopefully having said all of that i have been reading here that there are certain cars of a similar price and size with bigger if not substantially bigger motors that are superior vehicles for the money uhhuh right i suppose anybody can throw a big engine in any given car and proclaim it superior to other similar cars with smaller engines and i suppose to their way of thinking it is to my way of thinking thats the easy part and that its the rest of the package that makes the upgraded car truly superior would a ctsv for instance have acquitted itself as perfectly as my 530i did in the above situation unknown but i suspect that the ctsv is likely to have a much greater front end weight bias and as such would not have been able to perform the lane change and the deceleration without hitting the individual on the bike after his ill advised maneuver balance thats what the bmw offers and yes on paper it will certainly cost more for what you seem to get so if i had it to do all over again and if i was faced with the choice of a ctsv or my 530i for about the same price what would i choose probably the bmw call me naïve call me dumb call me wasteful call me a poseur call me whatever you like i can live with that  best regards\\nshipo that site doesnt tell me anything about what cr found m i love it in the end youre happy results likes these stem from surveys done on a vehicle spanning three model years trouble

offroad lol these dorks bought the h2 for exactly the reason one would expect  to show off one guy dumped his zo6 for it and the other parted with his boxster s because it was too much trouble to shift shipo im glad you like your car and feel safe in it but its extra mass means that it has worse skidpad numbers and longer braking than many of the cars in the title of this discussion so i would certainly not say that they cannot handle the situation as well or better yeah id take a 28000 g in that situation over any non m bmw and id take a bmw over 998 of all other makes and models out there i think the numbers and actual dynamics of both cars are good but there is a consistently better performance margin from the g which would indicate ease of manuevering in same situation and weve beat the brakes thing to death the bmw is more forgiving and not as sport as the barely entry lux g doubt there much to disagree with other than preference there both cars on the autobahn are better than any caddy  so farshipo hit it on the head pretty well with the stuffing a big motor in it doesnt make it betteri was dissapointed in what ive discovered about the ctsv and would hope a 300hp 6 and a better interor was in the making extra mass compared to what not trying to pick a fight however the manual transmission version of the 530i weighs in at only 96 pounds more than a three pedal g35 sedan thats not even a tank of gas that said the sp on my 530i includes 235 section width tires as opposed to the 215 tires that come on the g35 my guess is that the extra inch of tire width will at least offset the whopping 96 pound weight difference call it a draw regarding my comment about another car acquitting itself as well as my car did in the situation i found myself in you will notice that i was referring a presumably nose heavy ctsv and not the g35 i consider the g a reasonably well balanced car with very acceptable driving characteristics to my eye however its styling inside and out just doesnt pass muster which i understand is simply personal preference best regards\\nshipo ctsv is 5446 according to road and track thats not nose heavy since you are commenting quite a bit about your 5 series and weight consider this comment by cd mar 2004 in regards to the m5 vs ctsv cadillacs steering was gratifyingly precise it turned in like marshall faulk cutting for the goal line and if its weight transfer wasnt quite as smoothly managed as the m5s there wasnt a hint of reluctance in its transient responses the ctsv was also perfectly happy to provide the driver with as much oversteer as he wanted the breakaway might be a little more abrupt but once rotation set in it was easy enough to control with a judicious throttle foot as we all know the ctsv edged out the m5 in lap times despite the driver admittingly shortshifting due to a faulty oil pressure sensor on the ctsv in his best estimate he would have beaten the m3 as well if pushing the caddy at 100 brian hmmm 5446 sounds nose heavy to me maybe not fwd nose heavy but front biased nonetheless especially when compared to the 501499 of the 530i regarding the e39 m5 that was so gracefully retired still at the top of the heap last year i suppose that cadillac should in all fairness be able to crow about being king of the hill for a while that is like everything else out there the competition does not stand still the odds on bet is that the ctsv will once again be considered an alsoran in a years time or so just like the cts has been since it was launched best regards\\nshipo the tl is nose heavy but still stops faster than the 530 and is neck and neck with last gens sport package 530 on the skidpad the 2004 is a big improvement however i do stand corrected on the mass however i thought it was much heavier than it really is as far as the ctsv being an alsoran i think it will still be held up as the most bang for the buck regardless its the same reason the z06 does so well in comparisons with much more expensive cars its not that its the best but its good enough that the reviewers would opt for it and save a bundle of money over similar vehicles cadillacs steering was gratifyingly precise it turned in like marshall faulk cutting for the goal line and if its weight transfer wasnt quite as smoothly managed as the m5s there wasnt a hint of reluctance in its transient responses uh marshall faulk hasnt cut smoothly in a couple years hes basically emmitt smith jr out there now i am glad you avoided an accident and you are ok but to say that your bmw 530 could do something and another car could not do it is simply ridiculus unless you have tried the same manuevuer with another car you are taking a huge leap of faith ummm maybe i missed it where exactly did i say that my 530i would do anything better than anything else if i remember correctly i said i suspect yes no best regards\\nshipo come on shipo you are implying that the cts could never pull that maneuver because of what you infer about its weight distribution lets not kid the ongoing conversations but i am just letting you all know that yesterday i gave a 528i a spanking it would never forget\\nthe guy initiated the call and all he was looking at during the race was my tls doulble pipes one up for us fwd given that the ctsv and the 530i are within seven pounds of each other with similar sized brakes and tires and assuming that both cars have an abs system that keeps the rubber on the ragged edge of lockup and that both cars have the brake assist feature im not sure about the ctsv my guess is that it would be a very close contest to see which car would slow down from 128 to about 70 the quickest all else being equal which of course it never is the car with the better weight distribution should handle the maneuver better than the one with the front end weight bias would the ctsv have acquitted itself as well maybe maybe not best regards\\nshipo oooo  a tl beat the 200 hp machine of a 528 when you can pull on the 540i then you might impress someone thats assuming this guy with his 528 was actually looking to race too seems many people think youre looking for trouble when youre just out and about i get people all the time spinning their engines and glancing at my at stoplights the light changes and then they take off have fun bud i like to play with my car but in sd racing or giving the appearance of racing is a sure ticket no thanks that said once in awhile im at the front of a light i know the two lanes become one quickly and somebody pulls up beside me doing the creep thing as they await the light change we all know he wants to shoot out and take the lead when im feeling nice i let it slide feistyi like to let him accelerate and i keep pace for a bit as his engine screams  seems suv drivers do this the most often as we build speed i finally just wave and punch it bubye silly people i just know one of these days a kid with a turbocharged protege will smack me in the face as he scampers away faster depending on the year the e39 528i had either 190 or 193 hp regardless of which one was the subject of the above abject humiliation billyperks you da man now best regards\\nshipo the tl is nose heavy but still stops faster than the 530 and is neck and neck with last gens sport package 530 on the skidpad the 2004 is a big improvement however the tl has turned in some extremely disappointing stops from 700 was it the rt article that listed 188 feet the 530 certainly stops faster than that from 70 to 0 so i dont see how it stops faster than the 530 std vs std 600 edmunds stats of \\nbmw 530i 11933 ft\\nacura tl 11596 ft or msn auto 114 ft you dont see it while everybody else does  i see good numbers on the tl in once place and see them very inconsistent everywhere else the car does seem to give every tester a sub 6 060 so ill give the car props for that just be careful when stomping it from a stoppeople in other forums are saying if youre next to a tl and it launches it will veer right and one guy almost got slammed i now stay to the left of tls when appoaching lights  they are everywhere now and a racy bunch too ah i think were all missing it  great reaction times s best car in the world would just run the guy over if you didnt react sorry  thats a personal comment we probably have to delete it  me and my friend who owns a mustang gt 2001 mt with 28k mileage gave our car a try out last weekend guess who won  but i think its not fair to try a 3 years old car against a new car and we only tested them until 90 mph he brought the car for a check last monday that was the first time i floored it so fast and it was fast and scary cuz i didnt know how it would react but it turned out fine other car may react differently just be very careful but not mine it could be true what chris said bcuz of the enormous power i dont see much tl in chicago 2 or 3 the most since jan 04 maybe in other part of the country i know they would be racy bcuz of the engine power and its sound it sounds like a soft jet engine underneath not loud but cool unlike my friends car its so loud teaser pics of infinitis thatll be at the nyas is at wwwinfiniticom i believe that the last interior pic is of the m3545 and the second to last is of the q45 or maybe the m3545 as well really cant tell for sure though wow  not here in the twin cities ordered mine around the first of the year and get it the end of this month so far while watching all the time for them i have seen a sum total of two 2 2004 tls on the open road wish i would see more of them  but know i will still be unusual when i get behind the wheel soon httpwww2autospiescomarticleindexasparticleid2682ca tegoryid7 according to that bmw will start producing the next 3 sometime this year but the bulk of the production will start in 2005 leads me to believe that itll be available in the us maybe mid 2005 as a 2006 model chrisboth is correct the tl is all over the place sure we can quote the best stat from every magazine but the tl has turned in some disappointing numbers in some reviews cr has the tl stopping in 130 the 330 in 131 cr has the tl to 60 in 67 the 330 in 66 at any rate depending on the review these numbers vary a bit acura tl\\ncardriver 060 57 secs\\nmotorweek 600 114 ft yeap tl is all over the place said by bmw lover lol yeah especially when one is auto and one is manual as it would for any car it would help to say whether the time was with auto or manual acura tl\\nss mopar muscle 060 57 secs\\nfantacy car dot com 060 57 secs\\ncardriver 060 57 secs so i guess i dont need to reply about the stopping distance of the tl being better than the 530 i mean since danny listed a source and you listed a source and the one i was going to quote was cd so all 3 of us are in agreement now i assume yeah especially when one is auto and one is manual as it would for any car it would help to say whether the time was with auto or manual  the difference between the auto and 6mt fot the g35 is about 2 secs to 60 and 12 in 14 mile times thats the beauty of the g auto having the q 5at in it its not as bmw smooth but youll notice a big drop for the 3 auto as well the tranny can handle 345  hp so that may be the diffwho knows honda autos have never been a wonder of mankindthe 6sp on the other hand is perfect to shift 04 ctsv 70 to 0 in 165 ft\\n04 530i 70 to 0 in 167 ft source cd 2 ft isnt much it could be the difference between a cool day and a warm one point is they are competitive as far as the ctsv being an alsoran dont think that cadillac will stick with the 400hp ls6 forever the new ls2 will make its way over and power will go up in the next year or two brian i am not here to dispute those numbers but in shipos situation i would take the 530i any day over the ctsvand i am no bmw lover he slowed down from 12870 and made an emergency lane change that is not 700 i like the caddy somewhat but ill take the bimmer in that situation too hands down give me the ctsv over a 530i wsport pkg now i would have a much harder choice with a 545i wsport pkg last night i saw a brand new ctsv from the famous san fernando valley casa de cadillac it was beautiful raven black with chrome wheels and sharp as a tack words you dont read often the cts was beautiful especially not in california cant they take away a license in ca if you buy american first of all let me say i think the 530i is one of the finest cars ever made however your example of driving 128mph on the autobahn and making a panic stop is hardly a good reason for somebody to buy one here in america if you were going 128 mph here you could expect a ride in the back of a police cruiser while wearing a nice new set of bracelets you would get zero sympathy in the courts of law and public opinion even if someone did pull right out in front of you the important thing is you enjoy your car everything else is just my dad can beat up your dad i find it humorous that 30 year old professionals worry about getting beaten in a stoplight dragrace by another 30 year old in a 3050k car what are we 17 year old punks in riced out civics and neons i like my tsx i really dont care if anyone else does i bought it to impress me not you well i wont speak for everyone but im not ashamed to say it yes many times i do turn into a 17yearold punk when i get behind the wheel well 17 in attitude 30 in experience and i dont know many enthusiasts who arent the same way even when im in the passenger seat with my wife driving im constantly thinking geez how can you let that guy do that to you or awww come on step on it  there is no other situation in life where i act quite the same too righttoo funnybut too right i hated riding in the car with my last girlfriend an inferiating mix of bad driving skills and wishywashy lane changes drove me mad right lane is open lights going yellow speed up we need to get ahead this guy to get into that lane i think she hated having my ride along as much as i did i have settled in a bit but i am still very impatient on the roadswish i could make red lights turn green and could bump slow junkers off the road when they block my lanes all of the numbers that have been posted here regarding how well the 530i stops have been for the 2004 e60 version my 530i is a 2002 vintage and while both cars are of a similar weight there is one potentially significant difference tires the e60 sport package or otherwise comes equipped with runflat tires while mine is equipped with good old fashioned performance tires that will go flat if punctured so whats my point so far anyway everything that i have read regarding the handling and braking capabilities of the new runflat tires has been less that complementary does that mean that my 2002 sp equipped 530i will brake shorter than a 2004 similarly equipped i dont really know but my guess is yes best regards\\nshipo lol i agree actually what drives me nuts are the cats who are in the middle lane and theyll move to the fast lane at 6570 when nobody is in front of them now ive gotta switch lanes and dodge around el moron who will all too frequently flash his lights at me yes im the big jerk because im going faster than he is and he cut me off sigh and most of my family and friends drive as if theyre afraid of their cars squirt out a kid and suddenly they turn into stepford drivers i agree actually what drives me nuts are the cats who are in the middle lane and theyll move to the fast lane at 6570 when nobody is in front of them lane squatters indeed the bane of modern

what the obsession is with 060 mph times an interesting number same for any single piece of data but a car is more than data points it is about the total package that includes performance maintenance ownership costs reliability fun factor etc a car is about how the parts work together as a whole not how the parts are looked at individually for 060 mph fans read the fine print in each source for how they do their test the mags use different methods and keep in mind that some magazines adjust the times for temperature and other conditions while other publications publish the actual realized figure i much prefer the uncorrected numbers i much prefer cds 560 mph street start number a much more realistic number for the vast majority of drivers my tires are too precious to waste on 3k drop smoking rubber maximum acceleration launches and my clutch and tranny are even more precious than the tires that is why you have to look at all stats not just 060 or 560 i think mags should adjust numbers you cant compare stats taken on different tracks or in different weather conditions if they dont play with numbers to much i think its the right way to go ot but i bet your near luxury

trying to show that tl 700 and skidpad are not bad having said all of that i have been reading here that there are certain cars of a similar price and size with bigger if not substantially bigger motors that are superior vehicles for the money uhhuh right i suppose anybody can throw a big engine in any given car and proclaim it superior to other similar cars with smaller engines and i suppose to their way of thinking it is to my way of thinking thats the easy part and that its the rest of the package that makes the upgraded car truly superior would a ctsv for instance have acquitted itself as perfectly as my 530i did in the above situation unknown but i suspect that the ctsv is likely to have a much greater front end weight bias and as such would not have been able to perform the lane change and the deceleration without hitting the individual on the bike after his ill advised maneuver let me setup a scenario you go to the track to race somebody in a ctsv or even  say  a pontiac gto after they smoke you you get out  fuming mad  and shout well my car has more horsepower per liter thats all that counts thats what makes my engine superior they cheated they have more displacement sound absurd to you well thats what your argument amounts to this is a miserable debate  born out of lies and advertising propaganda  that repeats itself each hour of the day all over car forums on the internet by people who overpaid for imports with engines that the dealers said is superior to anything made in america and then end up getting owned by folks driving cars with oldtech ohv engines a couple of clowns who write for auto publications have decreed that its better to produce additional power by revving at higher rpms than it is by increasing displacement why because they said so because they have english degrees and no science training from 3rd rate universities to back it up thats why and anyone who challenges this orthodoxy is labelled a luddite i suppose for you old dudes its kind of like vietnam they lied to us man they lied to us  now the 2004 bmw 530 isnt a bad car but it is overpriced and it looks like a honda from the rear and if you think its any performance match for the ctsv then im afraid you smoked too much of that green stuff back in the jungles of nam first of all id like to point out that the euros would make more high displacement engines if they could theres no replacement for displacement in their home markets they have moronic laws that tax based on engine displacement thats why they shift development dollars to those high revving buzzboxes when displacment is limited and youre making a 6 or 8 cyllinder engine youll get more power out of dohc even though ohv has a higher power density which i will explain in a minute second displacement tells you nothing about an engines actual size repeat after me kiddies displacement tells you nothing about an engines actual size gms ls6 for example is smaller than nissans 35l vq a v6 engine ohv engines have more compact packaging than dohcs thats why the ls6 has such high power density unmatched by anything that bmw has got third the ls6 also produces power in a more fuel efficient manner than bmws m5 and m3 engines its smaller more fuel efficient and more powerful i fail to see what  if any  the redeeming aspects of bmws m engines are and keep in mind im talking about the m engines your 530 engine isnt even in this league finally i dont know where you got the impression that your 530 can outhandle a ctsv the ctsv smoked the bmw m5 and m3 on the nurburgring its fast in 060 and its no slouch in 600 thanks to the 14 inch brembos for that matter i doubt your 530 could keep up with the plain old 36l 255hp cts that sells well equipped for 35000 i think that you need to take a chillpill and look at the absurdity of some of your own arguements if i wanted to drag race i certainly wouldnt have bought a 530i family sedan i wouldnt have bought a ctsv either in fact i wouldnt have bought anything currently available on the new car market what would i have done i would have built my own best regards\\nshipo hey folks maybe this would be a good time to get back to the near luxury performance sedans weve been talking about i think we were in general agreement that the ctsv and even the 5series are not in this category thanks ctsv has some impressive number but its a cheap build car for 50k i am not a big fan of bmw but you cant even compare m3 and m5 to ctsv cadillac is even less reliable than bmw everything except the engine is junk in ctsv if you want to talk about race track wrx sti with 25l will smoke both ctsv and gto cadillac is even less reliable than bmw not according to jd power in the 2003 vehicle dependability study cadillac cleaned bmws clock httpwwwjdpacompresspassprimages2003050bfullgif in the 2003 initial quality study the cadillac cts has 88 problems per 100 vehicles which is better than any car made in europe and beaten by only a handful of toyota products and 2 chevrolets when compared to all cars sold in america httpwwwjdpacompresspassprimages2003028dfullgif the subaru wrx is a noisy little buzzbox with a cramped interior and an uncomfortable ride it is most definitely not any kind of luxury car its an econobox thats been pushed to the max i suppose some people like those who actually liked that movie fast and furious might go for such a thing but i wouldnt want to be caught dead in one sorry gang its time for me to come clean i know absolutely nothing about cars engines driving or anything else for that matter after all im only a 12 year old plebe and my greatest aspiration is to drive my dads old 1970 chevy vega complete with 2speed slip and slide power glide when i grow up maybe ill check back in and see how things are going  hasta luego\\nshipo well according to much more respected source cr cadillac is much less reliable than bmw and its getting worse with age of the vehicles see link below httpwwwconsumerreportsorgmaincontentdisplay_reportjspfo    lder3c3efolder_id402631assortment3c3east_id389451    bmuid1078916491036 as for wrx you right it is noisy little box but so as ctsv cheap leather and name cadillac dont make a car luxury and quite oh ye wrx cost 15k less wait for new m5 and than well talk i am not trying to diss american automakers but it is well knowen fact that japanese and european performance vehicles way better than american and korean may be with time kia and gm will build something to talk about but not yet not yet mr cornell is just a proud owner of a plain old 36l 255hp cts which pretty much explains why he has his shorts in a knot lol isnt the ls6 a dog of an engine the stats on the ls6 according to gms website are not very impressive for a 57l engine which btw is the displacement i guess the 6 in ls6 is due to the fact it is almost 6 liters so yes when you compare the ls6 with the new bmw v10 which is a 5l liter engine and bmw is claiming 060 in 39 you really get to see why the ls6 is superior to anything out there and makes more with its displacment than anything else out there argument is not about history or about engine its about total package i can give you that ls6 is a good engine i dont know if its better than new m5 engine but its good there is lots more to the performance than engine and american manufacturers cant figure it out one more thing ls6 is heavier than bmw v10 for all i know the ls6 could be the best engine in the world if it were not surrounded by poor quality construction and cheapeast gm plastic no thanks ill pass there is lots more to the performance than engine and american manufacturers cant figure it out it seems to me like they have figured it out the ctsv 819 beat the bmw m5 820 fastest recorded on the nurburgring you right about quality and cheap plastic premed question rises have you ever driven ctsv or you just looking at one cr review because if you are cd is not very reliable source according to cd m3 roadholding g is 83 and 325 with all season tires roadholding g is 89 if you ask me dose not make any sense a lot of american car buffs get extremely upset about foreign car buffs claining this stat is incredibly impressive or whatever frankly i dont hear the argument being made that hpl is very important now hpengine size and hpweight yes those have impacts on handling maintainability car design and safety now personally i think smaller higherrevving engines are more fun to drive assuming that the powers still there i truly honestly feel that big ohv engines dont give as much feedback and dont sound as good but i dont understand this whole idea of racing people and getting upset if you lose on my bicycle i might care but that car isnt me once again size of the engine does not make car perform better or be better quality why is that bmws with big engines have perfect balance and ctsvwith small perfect engine does not european and espacialy japanese car makers spend tones of money on research and development of new engines wheelbase and so on ls6 is been around for years with minor modifications thats why its cheap what does the size of the engine in the engine compartment have to do with 060 a 25l evosti can dust an ctsv or anything else although admittedly the luxo factor is not there its about engineering not engine size in the engine compartment the europeans put a big engine into a small car the audi s4 is in every way leaps and bounds ahead of the ctsv sure the ctsv has more horsepower but it146s not just horsepower that counts the ctsv is to put it bluntly crude its nvh noise vibration and harshness is subpar thanks to the almost bobble headish action of the gear shifter not to mention the cts has a difficult time handling the 400 hp produced by its 57l v8 the s4 on the other hand seems to handle the added power of its 42l v8 with grace and precision there146s no vibration from the steering wheel or shifter and the sound from the exhaust is not overwhelming all in all audi has managed to provide the power and refinement of an engine normally found in bigticket cars in a refined and much more affordable package proving it does take more than slapping a big engine in a small car to make our list  wardsautocom top 10 best engines talking about big displacement many people i know including my self would rather drive small 27 turbo than big 42 v8 httpwwwdetnewscom2004autosinsider040315a0191961htm article displays market shares in 01 and 03 for premium brands in california one infiniti gains the most ground followed by bmw it passes caddy lincoln volvo  audi and closing in on acura two acura is the only one to lose ground third it doesnt have mb but im sure its among the top 3 you must keep in mind that these results do not take into account the now record breaking sales of the 2004 acura tl or any other 2004 acura vehicle well we might have to wait until 2005 to see that they wards seemed very biased toward the s4 i wouldnt really classify a 42l v8 as a big engine when benz puts the 54l v8 into the c classc55 amg you can call that a big engine plus they seemed to omit the fact that the s4 is awd and produces only 302 lbsft as opposed to 390 in the ctsv i dont get why people still bring up the hpl arguement who cares how much the enigne displaces as long as its producing acceptable power and torque while delivering resonable fuel economy mbs naturally aspirated amg v8 is only putting out about 350 hp out of 54l and i never heard a complaint torque is what some people crave some people like high revs that doesnt make either approach better or worse however few will argue that the ctsv needs to be much more refined and precise overall before it can seriously complete with the foreigns cramming 400 horses down its throat just isnt going to cut it s4 m5 ctsv not in this thread although i will say in my final post about the 50k class that the s4 is not as accomodating to its passengers nor comfortable in its ride as the ctsv yes i speak from experience my friend has an s4 wonderful car rides on rails but you really feel the road theyre different flavors of the same car if you want the most extreme grip and acceleration you go audi if youre willing to sacrifice a tenth or two to gain some comfort and economy you go caddy i seriously doubt that anyone will cross shop the next m5 with these two beauties theres just too much of a price gap law of diminishing returns anyone  brian that is the problem with this board the basic definitions are unspecified what is near and how do you weight luxury vs performance does the 25000 tsx qualify the 40000 330i with perf pkg zhp a fully loaded 41000 tl aspec a 42500 stripped 525i with just sport pkg at least we are dealing with sedans and not coupes tourings or convertibles i really have no vested interest in this argument but to call the wrx or sti a buzzbox is an utter lack of understanding of performance sedans the ford focus svt and dodge srt4 and the like are cheap buzzboxes wrx and sti are in a class by themselves they are reliable can handle offroad highway and allweather with ease true cadillac has come a long way in quality but comparing it to the m series is utter nonsense you got that right the class is called ugly 1000 hp 060 in 5 microseconds who cares i wouldnt be caught dead driving these monstrosities obviously you are not the person they are going after they are incredible cars in their own rights but really have no place in this discussion as there is nothing close to luxury about them they are toys and great toys at that but not luxurysport cars if tl and g35 belong here so does sti doesnt price determine luxurynearluxury status at their nearly identical prices tl and g35 have more luxury sti has more performance a base 911 is a toy and has zero luxury unless you consider 70 grand in the luxury category i do moral of the story performance is a luxury by the way sti isnt ugly its chimpanzeecute bangle designs are officially ugly if tl and g35 belong here so does sti doesnt price determine luxurynearluxury status how about luxury and rigidity the sti is nice to drive and have fun but not a grown up car for those more mature folks not me of course who take folks to dinner and want a quiet ride when not putting thier foot in it the small economy size of the sti alone means it will be crossed with the civics and neons price comparisons may be there but that is all by the way sti isnt ugly its chimpanzeecute bangle designs are officially ugly ok ill give you that 95gt  obviously you are not the person they are going after yes i admit that and im grateful performance can be construed as a luxury but just because a car performs does not make it a luxury car you can get navigation in the mazda3 thats a luxury feature but does it make it a luxury car of course not the sti offers nothing luxurious other than its performance therefore it doesnt belong here if they want to put in power leather seats navigation much more sound deadening material etc etc then well talk exactly a price point cant be the only factor though it has to be taken into consideration i mean there are 4 door pickup trucks that probably fall into this category on the price sti is a sports car the fact that it has 4 doors is just a bonus if you throw sti out of here then boot g35 also as everyone seems to agree with regard its cheap interior theres nothing luxurious about lack of quality and if you call sti a sports car you have to call bmw 3series is300 etc sports cars i dont think so i wonder if paying 20 mil for a ride in the space shuttle would be considered a luxury you bet it is no plush leather and wood trim in those babies plus a major inconvenience during potty time but what you get for the dough is great 060 times great lap times weightlessness and an incredible view ill say it again performance is luxury the wrx certainly has enough performance but im not sure its luxurious enough to be considered nearluxury however a loaded 2005 legacy looks like itll fit the bill under this category think you are going way overboard there the sti has no sound deadning material and does not even come with a radio that is far different than the g35s use of low end plastics and as the sti is comparable in every performance catagory to sports cars costing far more i would say yes it is a sports car good luck finding an is300 or 3 series that can compete with it performance is an aspect of luxury but does not make a car a luxury car all the sedans we are discussing have a blending of luxuryperformance a loaded wrx might just barely get near the target criteria but the sti is a niche dedicated pocket rally rocket that is all performance and no amenities a loaded legacy gt also near way i look at it is that the fwd 4cyl tsx and 93 set the bare minimum for this category from there you initially move up to the 325i xtype 25 and cclass then onto the is300 g35 tl xtype 30 330i etc hard to say where it ends but always thought 40000 was into the next category subaru just doesnt seem to pass the marque bar certain marques almost automatically qualify\\nacura bmw cadillac infiniti jaguar lexus lincoln mb saab and volvo but vw is clearly moving into this market thinking the passat w8 6speed manual and sport pkg certainly qualifies in our discussion if vw can guess subaru might too old ford taurus sho would have too true cadillac has come a long way in quality but comparing it to the m series is utter nonsense nonsense how so m3 is stripped of must luxurious content yet commands an extreme price hike m5 is fast and great but look at the price compared to say a ctsv which has similiar size features power etc i know a new one is coming out to so yall can save that lecture im just illustrating the point the more companies are going to continue to succesfully low ball bmw and mb with equally equipped and performing cars for thousands less wrx and sti might have all the performance in the world but they are narrow focused products the what determines a near luxury car from say pocket rocket what else can the evosti do but go fast\\n  cramming 400 horses down its throat just isnt going to cut it thats another interesting post people on here are talking about the sti and evo being near luxury cars and others are saying the cvts isnt going to cut it when a comparably equipped 530i or e320 with 225 and 221 hp respecively can cost more than the v well if the v wont cut it what will you get 400hp standard everything except sunroof and a usuable rear seat and trunk all for under 51k meanwhile 6 cyl bmw 3s and mb cs can touch 44 without a problem a define near luxury cars as those whos prices start around 30k and provide somewhat uplevel features and safety equipement not found or not standard on cheaper midsized cars there are a few cars that bend the rule such as the maxima or avalon they can be had stripped or equipped with almost every two in the book a wrx or evo are not near luxury cars by any strech of the imagination however hears the real question how can cars like the 3 series and c class be near luxury when people can barely fit in the back seat i would just have a problems plunking down 40k if i couldnt fit in the back or get a weekends worth of suitcases in the trunk nobody is arguing with you that performance isnt luxury but were saying its not the only criteria to be considered a luxury or near luxury sedan by your standards wed have to include the neon srt4 here or why not even an expensive motorcycle is a ride in the space shuttle a luxury yes but what the heck does that have to do with a luxury sedan hey you can get shot out of a cannon and go really fast is that a luxury and if so does it have anything to do with this discussion if a tree falls in the forest  ah forget it funny you mentioned this one i actually test drove one last night phenomenal performance especially so at 21k however at no time did the word luxury ever enter my mind but i was still grinning an hour after my drive this little car has some serious seeds but it sure isnt luxurious i would agree that if you dont have leather power seats you are not luxury of course just having them does not luxury make my 01 accord coupe exv6 had a power leather seats and it was not luxury the sti is not luxury fast yes cool to me yes to others yes to some no would i want one hell no not at 34 with three kids the 04 tl 6 speed manual with navigation was the best combination of luxury and performace i could get in my price range also looked at maxima es is g35 there is obviously a class of carhmmmsports sedans perhaps that combine performance and luxury some tilt more to performance is 35 series some more to luxury es g35 and some are a perfect blend of the twomy tl ducking now as those german fans throw stuff at me no way that the sti is a sports sedan great perfromance no luxury ill say it again performance is luxury  so my zx11 ninja is the king of the land then luxury is not a function of power and perf a town car and a 3 series are both luxury as luxurys go id say speed is one of thembut alone it does not a lux car make how is an sti that most people think is and is an impreza ever considered lux unless the platform is rigid as 3 series or even a passat then forget it its an economy car that goes fastreal fast lux cars have luxury and are not annoying to drive tho after a 9 hour trip ahhh you guys are no fun  does the 911 belong in the high end luxury marque thread i say yes and our host pat agreed when the couchpotatoluxury fans tried to throw it out sti costs the same as tl and g35 all are available with four doors pat what do you say does sti get the boot  look at the topic  near luxury i am not about to argue that the sti is a luxury car but it could be a near luxury car pretty quickly if subaru so decided can you say saaburu 92x which is quickly thrwon together car the sti is not that far away as some are making it out to be for 34k more onstarnav more leathersuedealuminum sound deadining mcintosh stereo the plain wrx aero wing for you too cool stylistas would dress this car up nicely so for 3536k you could have a car that blows away all of the popular cars in this segment and still nice enough to take out a young lawyer babe never mind the sti though the new legacy is gonna take care of this segment soon enough than a svt its weird unofficial combination of the starting price make content and aim of the vehicle not the final price loaded the imprezza is an econobox at heart as is the neon the legacy is a midsize people mover like the accord and camry theyre all from manufacturers that are purely pedestrian acuras often noted as a tweener company as things like the rsx on the low end keep the high end from being taken seriously go into nordstrom and you see button downs for 15 like at mervyns then youre dragging down the brand and when buying near luxury you are buying into a brand image  which is entirely perceived subaru builds a fast car on a cheap platform its a fast cheap car that has prices which edge toward 30k the same can be said of say dodge with its 300m its still in the same exact brand as the 14k neon to me g35 is near luxury performance sedan it has good performance good sound system features of luxury car on the other hand sti does not even try to become one yes it has performance but thats about it no more and the price tag of this car is below near luxury performance sedan loud engine no radio i dunno but imo luxury means comfort relaxing car environment quiet ride and maybe auto features for all devices such as dual auto climate auto on off light rain sensing wiper auto pilot just kidding ctsv 5 series price tag is above near luxury sedan im not saying sti is luxurious in terms of buttfluffing comforts im saying its price tag qualifies it as near luxury and as a buttkickin performance sedan it qualifies as an appropriate subject of conversation in this thread its because of these purely pedestrian cheap platform cars that we have the nice affordable performance car options we have today the recent crossover suv awd sedan platforms today owe themselves to subaru the legacyoutback started the trend the wrx kicked it up a notch for sedans why do you think bmw came out with a zhp perforamce package out of their nature for value why are so many sedans in the 240280hp range prior to the wrx we were stuck at 175220hp omg  infiniti is now a luxury brand ok  who knew acura infiniti lincoln saab volvo are premium brands audi jag and lexus are luxury brands infiniti is moving up but not quite there\\nsubaru is a premium brand in terms of engineering but not there in terms of prestige the upgraded legacy might change that perception never mind the sti the new legacy is gonna take care of this segment soon enough the imprezza starts at under 20k its not a near luxury vehicle i can drop 10k worth of extras on a camry solara and get its price to 30k that car is still a toyota and its still based on a camry price does not equal luxury status nobody calls a 35k explorer a near luxury vehicle or a 40k expedition a luxury vehicle its still a ford if an es300 was on sale for 10k would that make it no longer nearluxury would it be outluxuried by a 15k dune buggy i think everyone understands that the lichpin for luxury is comfort to me climate control is a big musthave for any luxury car quiet and some degree of isolation from envronmental harshness is another and saab is definitely a luxury car at a time i had a 97 328 and a 97 900set and the set in several ways was more luxurious seats although in several ways not isolation i wouldnt consider saab volvo audi or acura luxury brands theyre tweener brands  they cant quite get over the hump to being considered on par with lexus or mb remember luxury is branding a ford by nature of being a ford is not a luxury vehicle the gt is still a ford regardless of price and performance kmart can sell a leather coat with diamonds for 5k but its still not an armani no matter what subaru will still have sub20k econo cars on its roster thus precluding it from being considered a true luxury brand this is acuras big failing too if the tsx held the bottom rung they might get looked at as a luxury brand with the tl they could for certain but the rsx is little more than a rebadged civic  much like the old g20 being a rebadged leatherlined sentra tweener brands are exactly what we are supposed to be talking about here i do believe while i agree that defining a near luxury performance sedan is difficult were kinda going all over the map here i guess ive been thinking of near luxury as entry level luxury and the reality is they could mean two different things if you thikn about it the term near luxury would tend to describe vehicles like the new loadedup accords  because of the word near as in close to  close to luxury is not entrylevel luxury and i think for the most part entrylevel luxury has been the main focus here should we create a price range how about 3242k along with a certain level of amenities  leather premium stereo climate control power seat adjustments upper range of safety features perhaps navi available at least as options what else how should we quantify performance i guess thats been a big stumper here hasnt it should we change the name of this discussion the opening post here does a great job of explaining the creators intent but maybe the name creates a little confusion cybersol mar 23 2002 204pm it would be nice if we could agree on a definition so we could talk about the cars instead of spending so much energy on the focus of the discussion itself  im sorry but the accord is still a honda so the price is not relevant it cant be a luxury car by virtue of its origins its not near to or close to being a luxury car when i read near or entrylevel lux i think of cars that are scraping the bottom of the luxury barrel  the 3 series the c class is300 es300 type x these are cars from luxury brands that are used to suck in buyers get them into the luxury fold with low prices and attempt to move them upmarket when they trade out in 35 years its a luxury brand selling first the brand and then the amenities  some upmarket bits  but for the most part its about getting buyers to associate good things with a brand they want buyers to identify with the brand and hope the buyers are looking to graduate up the accord is at the top of the honda food chain it tops out there so it cant possibly entrylevel lux  there is no upsell at the end of the accord tenure bmw jag mb will all atest to their desire to use their low end entry lux cars as a springboard relax blueguydotcom im not pushing for the accord to be included here i just used it as an example of a car that might be defined as close yet not in any category that includes the word luxury and i was puzzling about my own issues with the term near luxury because to me the definition of that term has to be not luxury by virture of the word near which means close but not there its entirely possible that im being way too literal here i think the cars you name are certainly some that this discussion could best serve i understand your point but scraping the bottom of the barrel is an image that is a little overly harsh regarding the very fine vehicles on your list read the first post here  it actually lays out the parameters pretty nicely other thoughts i dont agree with blueguys reasoning that a car cannot be considered a luxury car because the brand is not a luxury marque for example i would argue that the phaeton is certainly a luxury car although vw is not considered a luxury brand its really tough to say what is a near luxury perfomance sedan my thinking is that cars like a loaded maxima and legacy should belong in this group performance sedans and all of the issues prices and comparisons among any of these cars should be discussed too many hangups with luxury pat wrote\\nand i was puzzling about my own issues with the term near luxury because to me the definition of that term has to be not luxury by virture of the word near which means close but not there its entirely possible that im being way too literal here were in the same field i think i tend to view nearentry lux as a vehicle that doesnt have the full boat of brand cache a 3 series while fun still suffers in many eyes from the fact its a compact sedan you own a c or a 3 and its usually not a big deal an e class or a 5 series thats a car of breeding  all perception but thats what were talking about here i think the cars you name are certainly some that this discussion could best serve i understand your point but scraping the bottom of the barrel is an image that is a little overly harsh regarding the very fine vehicles on your list the average mom and pop car may even cost as much as the c is es etc but those hondastoyotas dont offer the visceral pop and the brand of the similarily priced possibly higher performing counterparts remember the c and 3 like the ml and x are there to get people into the brand lexus is was released with one goal lower the average age of lexus buyers they want to hook them into the brand at 20 so at 35 the ls is a reasonable jump jrock you mentioned the phaeton the sales of the phaeton 304 in the usa for january and february combined would lead one to conclude the general buying public doesnt accept the idea of a luxury vw its the company that makes the bug and still does to this day a 17k bug parked next to a 50k phaeton talk about a blunder by vw the very impressive phaeton has broken new ground and represents outofthebox thinking on the part of vw given enough time and further refinements performancehandling wise the phaeton will definitely give the mb s series and bmw 7 series a run for their money i give vw alot of credit for making this bold move all it takes is a little reeducation of the luxury buying public next thing you know you take what used to be known as an economy brand in a totally new directionperformanceluxury only problem is where does that leave audi wrong board that gm rhetoric leathersunroofhp per  wont get any traction here m tough can of worms i thought at first entrylevel lux might be the ticket to answering the question but then there are still some problems with that for instance the acura tsx is technically acuras entry level sedan not the tl the volvo s40 would be the entry not the s60 and the 1series bimmers would be in the same boat when and if they arrive yet we cant logically step up to the a6 and eclass just because we include the 2nd tier from the other brands so where does that leave us we could limit it to certain manufacturers but i fear this also presents a problem i think subaru for instance may compete very well with the new legacy if they chose to load it up with goodies is it fair to exclude them just because they cant afford to start up a whole new rebadged brand to accomodate their vehicles with luxo ammenities maybe its a more complex answer like if the brand has an upscale counterpart then the base brand is excluded so audi but no vw acura but no honda infinity but no nissan etc however if said brand has no upscale counterpart ie subaru saab mb bmw volvo etc then it can be considered on its own merits of course that still leaves us with the problem of someone complaining the sti should be included although it doesnt even offer a stereo so we still need to figure what is required at a minimum to make it a car with luxo aspirations maybe available navigation and power leather seats can anyone think of something that falls outside those requirements that would be included or excluded here unfairly i think it is a huge mistake by vw to try going upmarket if vw would just concentrate on building the audi brand they would be there no doubt the phaeton is a luxury vehicle comparable to the a8 but frankly it is wearing the wrong monicker but why the tl and not the tsx and why the s60 and not the s40 whereas i agree with you regarding some of these brands that do have existing upscale brands but come out with a luxurious car under the lower brand but im afraid opening the doors to lower brand names that have an upscale counterpart will then open comparisons of the loaded accord to the tl or tsx and the loaded maxima to the g35 where would that lead us volkwagens phaeton is a luxury car for people who prefer to wear their designer labels on the inside of their clothing if you can afford a handbuilt luxury car but dont need to go around with a threepointed star or a leaping cat or a flying lady hood ornament to proclaim your arrival then you may find that this new 64600 vw more than meets your needs we use the word more because the phaeton offers a luxury car with a 12cylinder engine for about the price of a v8powered mercedesbenz sclass phaeton comes standard with features such as a navigation system for about what youd pay for a basic shortwheelbase 7 series bmw volkswagen is moving upscale and the phaeton is its new luxury sedan the flagship of a fleet that in the north american market includes the golf new beetle jetta eurovan passat and the new touareg sportutility in 2006 we should see a modern interpretation of the hippies favorite the vw microbus followed perhaps by a new midengine twoseat sports car the expansion of the volkswagen brand is part of an effort to widen the scope of the entire vw group an automotive empire that includes vw audi seat skoda lamborghini bugatti and bentley in 1999 the volkswagen group ranked sixth in worldwide sales but subsequently has overtaken renaultnissan and daimlerchrysler and trails only general motors ford and toyota the term phaeton dates back to days of horsedrawn carriages and then was applied for special coachbuilt touring cars with custom features in the case of the volkswagen phaeton most of those custom features are included as standard equipment  larry edsall automotivecom i remember a few years back when i first remember hearing this term nearluxury car at the time most of them were rebadged camrys es300 nissans i30 etc thus many people considered them to basically be fancier camrys et al with higher stickers these cars didnt differ much from their platformmates and were lacking many of the luxury features of the true luxury cars it seems to me like the term may be a bit more problematic now yes the es330 is still built on the camry platform and the i35 is still based on the maxima however they look a lot different than the base cars now and have quite a few more luxury features than before in addition the lowerend luxury models are now featuring extremely nice interiors many luxury features etc even though my 04 tl is considered nearluxury the interior still feels every bit as nice to me as my old 93 bmw 525i did if not more so now im not going to throw a grenade in the tent by trying to compare the handling of the two cars maybe entrylevel luxury is a better term for these cars now jeff yeah a very select group are willing to pay 60k for a vw boy those trailblazers this isnt like toyota creating lexus and the groundbreaking 35k ls400 toyota had a great reputation  something vw doesnt have toyota created a luxury brand from scratch and populated it with a vehicle that mirrored the big boy on the block  mb but for less money vws phaeton mirrorsthe passat oh theres a marketing coup lets nail down the logic weve got a company well known for mechanical and electrical problems offering a high priced luxocruiser under the same banner as 16k economy cars and the new car most closely resembles a 2340k midsize sedan thats just brilliant gosh i sure hope ford comes out with a plussized version of the taurus and sells it for 50k thatd be keen branding thats what its all about in the luxury arena ask mb about the maybach the phaeton will be a bigger and much costlier bust than the w8 passat which went nowhere in sales and that was a 3840k car yeah vw quality is in the toilet literally vw execs should take a good hard look from japan you gotta have a solid foundation before you reach for the glam and glitz why not promote the a8 more which never was a big seller instead of handicaping it with a near twin real smart eh but there is good in that vw techs will have even greater job security now that the phaetons out it seems like it would be better for vw to move slowly up market rather than such a large leap most reviews ive read have been pretty positive but they all question whether buyers will be willing to forgo the snob appeal to obtain a better value in their luxury cars the phaeton is a pretty nice looking car imho and in some ways it might be nice to have a car that doesnt scream i have lots of money as far as quality goes the bmw 7series and mercedes sclass have been having some quality problems of their own lately\\n \\njeff now really the phaeton and the 7series and the sclass are not anywhere close to the near or entrylevel lux category how about if we just say 32k to 42k as a minimum requirement for eligibility in this discussion that would at least keep us within some workable range i want to change near to entrylevel in the title how about if i also drop performance i think that should make unnecessary some of the carryingson about what belongs here and what doesnt let me hear what you have to say and ill make up my mind tomorrow keep performanceotherwise i35 and es330 owners will be in here babbling about smooth rides im fine with your suggested changes dropping performance from the moniker should only add the es330 among the imports to the discussion as that car is the only car that is decidely nonperformance in this price cateogry i read the g35x followup test on edmunds and i pretty much agree with what the writer said the design of the interior is fine except im not a big fan of the orange lights and i actually feel that the quality of the leather seats is better than the seats in the tl or the 3 series hopefully theyll really lick the dash material quality issues in the 2005 model is that 32k to 42k with or without options either way i guess it would have to be wouldnt it and i assume we are talking msrp numbers right i feel its a given but you just know someone will be over here saying but this guy says he knows a guy who read somewhere that this other guy bought a ctsv for 42k so well probably want to put a stop to that now and specify its msrp numbers why cant we just accept that everyone has a different opinion of where the near luxury line is drawn for example riez stated that he thinks the is300 is higher on the food chain than the 325i probably because it has a larger more powerful engine and he owns a couple of them i however consider the 325i higher on the food chain than the is300 because its just as quick but more refined and mature in my opinion price doesnt work either because of my admittedly biased opinion that the tsx belongs in the same league as the 325i and is300 because it offers similar performance and luxury but only costs 26000 and then theres the mazda 6s and v6 accord which offer performance and luxury on par with many of the cars here yet they simply lack breeding brand identification for a car to be a true nearluxury performance sedan i believe it must possess some combination of all of these traits in varying degrees maybe a formula could be devised assigning points for luxury brand name overall performance quality interiorcockpit exterior elegance overall driving refinement last night i was thinking that specifically the tsx would present a problem as a car that falls outside of the price requirements but that many folks would feel belongs here i dont feel the mazda competes here just on merit of being slow in a straight line it is also lacking quite a bit in the luxury department on merit of lacking sound deadening and something i feel should be available on a car that wants to be considered luxury navigation so to me the mazda belongs here no more than the sti does i think the accord is too closely tied to the tl if the accord is permitted then you open the doors to the maxima and camry and then you might as well include the kia amanti hyundai xg350 chrysler 300 etc etc fedlawman my initial ranking was based on price and layout the inexpensive fwd4cyl cars like tsx and 93 at bottom a stripped 325i is less expensive than an is300 has less standard equipment and a smaller engine plus the 330i is certainly higher up than the 325i thus the more expensive higher performing 330i is higher up than the is300 the manufacturers are fairly clear on their intentions whether or not to compete in the near sportyluxury segment it makes decisions pretty clear to me acura infinity bmw mercedes lexus etc  yes\\nchevy ford nissan honda toyota etc  no just because an accord may have all the bases covered does not mean it should be considered for this topic no one thinks the accord should be here i mentioned it as an example of how the name of this discussion could be misinterpreted but in no way did i suggest it should be included here gee its amazing how some things can take on a life of their own sometimes  the geo speck made from clay and epoxy has a nav so lets include that its funny how we want to exclude the poor accordians but hey they are not in the same league now are they i dont know what that is but does it also have power leather seats and respectable performance if so then it would meet all the requirements i previously mentioned so maybe i need to take a look at it and maybe reevaluate my criteria some would argue that true sport sedans need to be either rwd or awd fwd cars do not have the same sporting qualities discuss amongst yourselves p been

subject i wouldnt agree with that first its harder to define luxury in terms of brand rather the a specific car for example the q45 has more luxury than every lexus sedan except the ls430 and im not sure how infiniti and subaru belong in the same category even if we are talking about brands as a whole subaru makes 20k to 30k cars infiniti makes 30k to 60k cars this is how i would rank in terms of

luxury features easy entryexit feature heated steering wheel autoon headlightsthan the 03 tls 3series and is300 now if you think by merely having real wood on the 3series making it more luxurious than the maxima then i rest my caseits an individual thing maybe we should compare cars based on their own merits and not on their perceived images read brand names do not agree its the placement of the vehicle on a luxury brands scale that determines if its a nearentry level lux the 3 c a4 is300 are all nearentry theyre not luxury cars though theyre the feeders to fill coffers and get brand loyalty these cars exist at the bottom of a luxury brands offerings \\ninfiniti\\nlincoln\\nsaab\\nsubaru\\nvolkswagen\\nvolvo no way in hades is subaru near anything luxury subaru makes economy and joe blow cars if you sell a car for under 20k theres no way any vehicle from the brand can be considered luxury it goes against the concept of luxury branding as ive stated before kmart brand can sell a coat for 5k but in the end its still a kmart brand coat a nissan max loaded to the gills is still from the same brand as the sentra and frontier it may be the most expensive car in that brand but the brand itself is common place an entrylevel lux car is the bottom rung of the luxury brands offerings if the brand sells anything approaching economy cars it most certainly can not be a lux brand or offer anything that can be termed entrylevel lux why is this a tough concept for people infiniti is a brand that has shot up these last two years howver prior to that it wasnt very highly considered particularly in view of its rebadged vehicles let me admit i am a big subaru fan subarus are fairly highly regarded if they werent why do you see all the awd and sportwagons out these days i will agree that adding it to the premium segment is touchy but thats only because of the prior level of interior refinement and powertrain options the chassisplatforms and worldwide engine drivetrains are considered top notch the us is finally geting the nicer equipment plus nicer vehicles are in the works all the brands seem to be getting into the entry level market so no problem with suabru having entry level cars wouldnt europes mercedes benz aclass and bmw 3series compact and soon the 1series disqualify those two companies by your standards those models do not exist in the us and if they did bmw would be very worried about diluting its brand bmw dumped the 318ti because it was viewed as diminishing the brand read up on the worries from business analysts about the 1 series and mbs bust of a c coupe as bmw and mb reach more downmarket they risk becoming just another brand like mazda subaru or chevy sales numbers too threaten bmws branding as they expand lie down with dogs you wrote the 3 c a4 is300 are all nearentry theyre not luxury cars though i agree now about the kmart thing are you saying that even if the same objects can be had from kmart and say neiman marcus theyre still not the same are we talking about placebo effects here i think its only fair to compare things on what they have to offer and not their perceived images after all were not comparing brandnames hereor are we carlisimo well put i was thinking of the same thing been there done that for bmw and mblie down with dogs ok now all you bmw mb and lexus fans can start throwing stones now  the whole branding thing makes no sense to me but what if we said this a luxury brand is somewhat defined by its dealerships and service if you can get service loaners some period of free service and the dealerships are attractive and have a good chance of serving cappucinoits likely a luxury car i still think that significant noisesay low seventies cruisingshock supression toptier safety amenities such as climate controlleather heated seats and respectable power  say 060 in 8 seconds  are really requirements for luxury now about the kmart thing are you saying that even if the same objects can be had from kmart and say neiman marcus theyre still not the same are we talking about placebo effects here not the same objects though i specifically stated a kmart coat just like a honda accord is by definition a product of the kmarthonda brand i think its only fair to compare things on what they have to offer and not their perceived images after all were not comparing brandnames hereor are we yes we are entrylevel luxury has everything to do with branding you cant brand a nissan a luxury car as the brand is synonymous with being plebian this discussion reminds me of the clinton hearing it depends on what the meaning of is is i still think that significant noisesay low seventies cruisingshock supression toptier safety amenities such as climate controlleather heated seats and respectable power  say 060 in 8 seconds  are really requirements for luxury who makes the car determines if its luxury ask vw and its flailing phaeton how much good it does you to be the peoples car yet youve got all the same gizmos as a 7 series you dont simply sell a car youre selling someone a brand nike nordstrom mercedesall carry weight by virtue of branding do you agree or not luxury  audi  a8 l\\nbmw

as the dealer can rightly claim increasing hptorque with unauthorized mods put undue stree on the enginedriveline components that cause the failure 2 i do not believe these same mods contribute to an

mercs or bimmers you get in europethe vast majority will pick the camry as more luxurious dave they may say the camry feels more luxurious that doesnt change the impact of branding once the brands are revealed most people will change their tune the fact remains most people are influenced by branding like it or not most cats will cruise up to a subaru and a mb and theyll have instant views of quality luxury etc based purely on the badge brand name characteristics of a car or price limiter 1 if brand is the main qualifier then we couldnt include phaeton eventho phaeton is a bit more than just near luxo bcuz most of its product is non premium vehicle\\nwe have to include all lexus sedans eventho some of them doesnt have performance 2 if characteristic is the main qualifier then all sedan which qualify as premiumnear luxo perf have to be included too such as vw phaeton but not es330 but then we have to define the term of luxuryunfortunately how hard the car tries to be luxurious its brand name tells people otherwise and maybe we have to define the term of performance too 3 if price is the main qualifier then sti have to be included if we include g35 based on its stripper price tag it certainly would include es330 but not ctsv and maybe we have to define what price range that could be considered as the premium some people mightnot consider these sedans as premiumnear luxury performance sedans es330 1 series 325i tsx phaeton ctsv new accord subaru sti bcuz of various reasons underpower price such as over 40k or less than 30k regular brand name no luxury features no radio aahhh idk an entrylevel lux car is the bottom rung of the luxury brands offerings if the brand sells anything approaching economy cars it most certainly can not be a lux brand or offer anything that can be termed entrylevel lux why is this a tough concept for people its not a tough concept some people just dont agree with you and your definition i agree that there are brands considered luxury i dont agree that a car must be under such a brand name to be considered an entry luxury vehicle different concept of luxury i guess a coat labelled kmart neiman marcus or any other prestigious brands doesnt necessarily mean it was manufactured by those companies individually it probably comes from the same offshore sweat shop you dont simply sell a car youre selling someone a brand nike nordstrom mercedesall carry weight by virtue of branding true but a wise buyer should know what heshe is really buying nissan honda mazda subaruare not luxury brand  and never will i never say they are im comparing the luxury aspects cartocar i just hope that were not going to compare performances of these entry luxury cars based solely on brands and what those manufacturers claim their products can do i have said in other forums that my next car will most likely be a 3series but that decision is based on factors other than the luxury performance or brandname aspects of the car up to now ive never and never will thought of a 330i as being more luxurious or of better brand than my current maxima more power to the placebo effects nuff said cheers branding does not make a vehicle luxure or not even though vw is not a luxury brand phantom is a luxury car sales have nothing to do with it  if people dont buy it does not mean its not luxury vehicle in my opinion full size luxury cars are 745760 sclass q45 ls430 a8 phantom midsize luxury 5 series e class rl a6 m45 g430330 s type and finally near luxury or entry luxury 3 series tsxtl is g35 c class x type cts es330 now if you want to add performance than 325 tsx es330 c230 disqualified so i have only 6 vehicles left 330 tl g35 c320 cts and iswould not include is for luck of power but it handles grate i like tl best out of this group nice handling lots of power tones of luxury grate price i would probably go with 330 but dont like the interior and way to much money it makes no sense to have a discussion completely consumed with what the belongs in the discussion and what does not i think that the suggestion that the entrylevel lux category is the lowest sedan offering of a brand that is generally accepted as presenting the intent of a luxury appeal is a good one i think two good additions to that thought are that the sedan shouldnt exceed the 4042kish range in a common configuration and that maybe well include the 2nd bottom vehicle in some cases tsx and tl s40 and s60s60r so im exercising my um royal power  and declaring that this discussion is about the following vehicles acura tsx and tl\\naudi a4\\nbmw 3series\\ncadillac cts\\ninfiniti g35 and maybe i35\\njaguar xtype\\nlexus is 300 and maybe es 330\\nmercedesbenz cclass\\nvolvo s60s60r and maybe s40 im not adding volkswagen for a couple of reasons generally speaking one does not at least so far think of that brand when thinking of lux vehicles there is the phaeton but in no way is it in an entry level class so the way i see it it doesnt belong here either way im changing the name to entrylevel luxury performance sedans from near luxury performance sedans if for no other reason than to make me feel better about the name but im leaving the performance part so feel free to not discuss the maybe vehicles if you think they dont belong if anyone feels strongly that i have overlooked something important speak up within the next day or so or forever hold your peace thanks to all of you for your efforts in trying to get this nailed down now lets talk about cars and not about the discussion okay  a coat labelled kmart neiman marcus or any other prestigious brands doesnt necessarily mean it was manufactured by those companies individually it probably comes from the same offshore sweat shop so true id never argue one automatically means quality true but a wise buyer should know what heshe is really buying youve just eliminated 999 of the buying public i have said in other forums that my next car will most likely be a 3series but that decision is based on factors other than the luxury performance or brandname aspects of the car up to now ive never and never will thought of a 330i as being more luxurious or of better brand than my current maxima youre in the minority on this i would agree with you but most would feel otherwise mention you have a max and nobody cares mention the mb or bmw and the majority of people have a reaction based on the brand and what its associated with good or bad brand plays a big role in how the majority of the world views products more power to the placebo effects nuff said cheers yeah i had a friend reselling ugly bland ugg boots on ebay before xmas she was nearly doubling her investment pat  i think the saab 93 merits the list the features and interior are at least as nice as he cadillac jag infiniti volvo the power and drive of the aero model put it close also i considered the 95 but i dont think the saab brand presents as a a lux brand nor makes people think of luxury  am i wrong i did not know you care much about what other people think about your car i buy cars because i like it not because others think its prestigious or not as for 2004 maxima material wise its worse than 2003 almost as cheap as altima i say include it  it makes no difference what the brand is  its about individual vehicles es330 has no performance but you still decided to include it 95 does not have much luxure but good performance i think people think about saab like they think about volvo or acura not on the level of bmw or lexus but above toyota or nissan not too sure though ive always thought of saab as a tweener definitely above the basic japanese and american brands so i think it belongs come to think of it are there any base european brands offered here in the us i cant make an argument for the new subaru legacy gt just yet because its not here if it comes with the options for power leater and navigation that might be where it falls short does 060 in the anticipated sub 6 seconds and breaks 30k which it probably will then ill probably be fighting for it to be included and this is exactly where it gets too hard i think we need to stick to the brands that are striving to present a luxury image as a whole subaru is not one of those and i dont think saab is either weve got to draw the line somewhere and talk about the cars instead of the discussion its going to be somewhat arbitrary and not everyone is going to agree but if we are going to have a meaningful conversation we have to define the parameters and then stay within them ya know in the interests of keeping things simple i suggest pat that you lose the maybes from your list and add saab 93 and 95 i agree with jrock65 that saabs are perceived as being more upscale than the nissans toyotas hondas etc more or less in the same bracket as volvos there is some truth to every perspective on the issue of what cars belong in this discussion cars use combination brands  the make and the individual model name  to perhaps benefit from both family branding and individual branding so while there is some halo effect from the make the dominant perception is one based on the individual model people may swear by the pathfinder while detesting the xterra for example a person driving around in a land cruiser is looked upon very differently than one tooling around in a corolla so in my view it is more meaningful to discuss specific models as being in the upscale performance sedan category in some hopefully rare cases therefore cars from socalled lesser makes may deserve to be discussed in this forum as well there are as many best buys as there are people it is after all a function of priorities driven by individual andor family needs and wants every car is a compromise among competing demands just as every purchase decision is a lot of the firepower in these forums while highly entertaining is often misdirected a lot of the criticism of different cars and occasionally their owners is analogous to faulting the lion for not having the grace of a gazelle just my 2c\\nraj thank you pat for just putting a list together fwiw i think saab belongs here the 93 and 95 are crossshopped with all of the above cars at least in my area ny suburu might build an amazing 30k legacy but it doesnt belong here just my 002 i agree the saabs belong and the subaru doesnt sorry but i also believe that like it or not branding does play a role in this subject for example if the lexus is300 was sold here as the 25000 toyota altezza it would not qualify as entrylevel lux instead it would provide good competition for the mazda 6 people reacted more to my saab than my bmwi think it belongs i did not know you care much about what other people think about your car i do care because since ive purchased a bmw ive found im treated quite differently when people connect me with the car for the most part the experiences have been quite negative but the fact remains in my protege im anonymous not so in my other car i buy cars because i like it not because others think its prestigious or not i never wrote you or i did otherwise but when you read the reasons most people buy cars its rarely related to how the car drives  reputation for dependability and resale is what drives honda and toyota in such a big way fwiw i think saab belongs here the 93 and 95 are crossshopped with all of the above cars at least in my area ny wow in all my time helping friends and family drive cars ive only gotten one person to even test drive a saab she thought it was nice if underpowered i have two friends who were raised on saabs and there seems to be some kind of genetic code that passes from parent to child to get the kid into saabs when i did my looking the saab never entered my radar front wheel drive and gmrunning for the hills i agree with what youre saying for the most part but the phaeton is most definitely a fullon luxury car reguardless of the badge it might have the wrong badge and sits in the wrong showroom but it is the real deal pg48477 i take it you mean the phaeton not the phantom the phantom is a rollsroyce and it is several times more luxury car than anything being discussed in this topic m it is a car that defines near luxury the 2004 is selling at about 28000 after discounts and incentives i think it has the most bang for the buck in the near luxury class and the soon to be released chrysler 300c hemi version should also be considered although i think it may be eligible for the luxury car class not just near luxury it will sell for around 34k very well equipped i own a 2000 300m with 70k on the dial and it still rides as good as the day i got it some of the members of the 300m enthusiasts club claim with some slight modifications that they get under 15 second quarter mile times and the car just has very unique and classy styling but if subaru is being disallowed then so is chrysler  no matter how nice or expensive it may be just wanted to add lincoln ls to the list and i still vote for saab if its not in the same category as volvo and acura then where is it its definitely not competing with civics and sentras chrysler is actually a luxury brand according to mercedesthe crossfire would be here if it had 4 doors and the pacifica is a pretty well done luxury hybridpeople may not recieve chrsyler as a lux brand but they certainly intend to be one everyone wants some entry lux pie and soon enough even the subbie may have to be included despite the branding thing fact is affluence is out there even where you dont see it and those stealty wealthy may just be able to get the lux and not the badge and the uninvited perceptions that a merc or bimmer bring you the wealthiest people i know drive accords and the pay checks to paychcks drive 5 series a company like subaru can give those who like to be unseen a little of what a bimmer offers without the price or the bs a company like subaru can give those who like to be unseen a little of what a bimmer offers without the price or the bs rofl scoobies have one big strike right off the bat awd another would be cheap interior materials one more would be the total lack of style inside and out kia rio exterior and interior pretty well matches the wrx the wrxsti is a fast car thats all it offers if speed were the only criteria for getting a car most of us would be driving around in one of those buzzy chincy econoboxes arent the lexus 330 and the 300m substantially about luxury with no significant emphasis on performance i know we could say acceleration equals some form of performance but i was thinking the handling aspect comes into play as well imho i look at the ls as more luxury than anything else the saab 93 and 95 belong in my eyes just my 02 imo subarus do not belong in this category while the saab 93 should definitely be added to the list thanks for the support i can see the arguement for calling it a tweener brand but it is a brand really shopped by people also looking and can afford acuras audis bmws and volvos i hope pat will add them to the list as for subaru i will give up the ghost although i think it deserves a consideration maybe not yet until the updated models come out and prove something but note subaru is also cross shopped with acura audi audi bmw and volvo for sure note also all the brands mentioned in this topic have reacted to what subaru has done so the other brand managers know whats up i wont argue awd vs rwd its a preference but awd provides awesome driving dynamics for a multitude of surfaes and conditions the chrysler 300m deserves consideration not for the brand but the car itself rofl scoobies have one big strike right off the bat awd another would be cheap interior materials one more would be the total lack of style inside and out kia rio exterior and interior pretty well matches the wrx  the wrx is a tin cani was referring to a 250hp upscaled sedan for 05  the legacy of course its awd but so is the a4 and while i wont buy one i know pleny of people making 300k who would they just dont care about rwd the way we do and they dont care about affluence but will spend 32k no problem this is a great segment with lots of people and lots of all the rules are changing fast and even kia and hyundia have nothing to stop them from competing too even in rwd format someday soon the wealthiest people i know drive accords and the pay checks to paychcks drive 5 series wow the wealthiest people i know drive 300k cars care about rwd and have interesting automobile collections but what has that to do with the price of tea seems like some of this conversation is about the type of person that drives one of these cars and not the type of car a person drives first this isnt about wealthy or not wealthy people it is about entrylevel luxury performance sedans we arent here to talk about people were here to talk about cars lets not get into categorizing generalizing assuming stereotyping the folks who drive them now as your host i am officially declaring this discussion about the following vehicles and no others acura tsx and tl\\naudi a4\\nbmw 3series\\ncadillac cts\\ninfiniti g35 and maybe i35\\njaguar

you want to talk about them talk about how they do or do not fit the performance description along with anything else of interest i am ruling out all other suggestions though for the reasons stated earlier those reasons include the fact that we should keep this to a marque that intends to convey luxury across its spectrum it is nonsensical to have a neverending discussion about what the discussion is about and most importantly its time to draw the line so here it is  talk about the cars in my list or go make another discussion if you need to talk about something else just keep in mind that another vague undefined category doesnt serve any purpose to keep it useful interesting and productive be sure to clearly define the topic okay have at it  first of all thanks pat for adding

whooped by a fwd 4 banger ooh boy those rwd only folks have got a task on their hands coming up with an explanation as to how this could have happened i guess the guy driving the tsx didnt know he didnt stand a chance because of torque steer and knowing in advance those rwd guys had perfect balanceblah blah blah\\nonce again that old addage turns out to be truewhen the green flag drops the bs stops between the tl and 3series it depends on your priorities if i wanted seat of the pants m3 for 3 series prices it would be zhp at the top of the list if i cared not about the precision feel of a bmw and slickness of the looks and just needed a car i will admit if those were the only 14 cars in the universe it would be the acura tl i havent driven one yet but by all accounts and specs thus far id have to say the new s40 t5 6speed is going to be high up on this list for me certainly much higher than number 11 looking at buddhas list s60r would probably outperform any car on the list but its a bit expensive i would consider 330 but new model should come out soon if only tl would come in awd i think tl with aspec would handle as well as 330 performance package but 5kinstallation is to much i find it quite amusing that for 5 pages or so the discussion focused on what the discussion was about reminds me so much of meetings meant to talk about other meetings i think pats list is a good one one addition in both my opinion and from magazines that compare vehicle in this class would be the lincoln ls first of all lincoln is obviously meant to be fords luxury brand secondly the ls costs between 3042k in most configurations third the car itself definitely has both luxury and performance intentions by all owner accounts it performs and handles well even if i personally would not be interested in a ford product at this time so that i have not driven one back to talking about cars if i were shopping today taking into account that my priorities are size performance price reliability and then luxury these sedans would be on my shopping list in this order 1 infiniti g35\\n2 acura tl\\n3 bmw 330i\\n4 everything else enjoy cybersol i said it before and ill say it again i really think this needs to be added according to cd 060 in 65 and\\nin most track trials the lincoln set stellar marks although it was wearing allweather tires usually thought to be a disadvantage it outran all but the benz on the skidpad and topped all in the lanechange test very shrewd choices were made in the chassis tuning of this car and since the sport v8 comes in at 40500 with delivery the only fault i see with it is the lack of a manual tranny but i dont see that as a reason to exclude it because some folks prefer an auto and some even require it ls is no near luxury if anything it would compete with 5 series gs rl and e class ls is no near luxury if anything it would compete with 5 series gs rl and e class not even close to these imo of course yes if you measure rear legroom but all of the above vehicles are a cut above the ls in terms of amenities the ls has no more luxury than a mountaineer you right i was also referring to size ls is a to big to be considered near luxury and not enof luxury and quality to go up to eclass  nominations for the list are no longer being accepted  anyone want to talk about the cars that are on the list  acura tsx and tl\\naudi a4\\nbmw 3series\\ncadillac cts\\ninfiniti g35 and maybe i35\\njaguar xtype\\nlexus is 300 and maybe es 330\\nmercedesbenz cclass\\nsaab 93 and 95\\nvolvo s60s60r and maybe s40 ummm yeah ok sure the lincoln has a whopping 38 inches in length over the cts and the cts even has more rear legroom but regardless ive grown tired of getting disciplined by the principal so have at it i went through all of the comparisons of the cars on this list in january while i was trying to decide which car to order i ended up ordering a cts with the luxurysport package and the dvd navigation system blue chip exterior light grayebony interior i drove the bmw 3 series and liked its driving characteristics but didnt care for its styling or interior room the same can be said for the mercedes c classi drove a v6 version and while it was a solid quiet riding car it didnt have the interior space i was looking for i very seriously considered the lexus es 330 but ultimately decided that while it rode very smooth and quietly the handling just wasnt there the fact that it basically looked like a camry didnt help either   i had a bad prior ownership experience with a honda so did not consider the acura   the cts seemed to have exactly what i was looking for a quiet comfortable ride combined with excellent handling plenty of interior space in both the back and front seats and a very refined smooth and powerful engine the real bonus for me is the styling of the exterior thoughthe cts is one fine looking car from any angle and doesnt look like just another box on wheels i checked with my dealer today and he expects my car to be delivered within the next week or so im looking forward to that well here is something that autospies has to say about the next 3 doesnt really say anything that people didnt know or were speculating already httpwww2autospiescomarticleindexasparticleid2742ca tegoryid11 i dont think bmw is going to keep the price of the car same or lower with more standard features they did really jack up the price of the new 5 well see took my tsx to a bmwcca track event yesterday at pacific raceways perfect weather beautiful cars and a terrific experience my fwd 4banger kept up just fine with all those e46 325s i lapped more than a few inexperienced drivers piloting e46 330s and even paced a well driven e36 m3 for one complete lapwhat a blast then i got a 4 lap ride in a 96 porsche 911 turbo wow what elsetwo 350zs were out on the track  they sound awesome nice throaty exhaust accelerating down the straightaway and through turn 1 also one guy had a late model lotus esprit and there were two wrx stis out there one of the stis was in my group and got behind me seemingly out of nowhere i waved him past me after exiting turn 9 and he passed me like i was standing still i was doing about 60 overall a terrific club and an awesome day of fun at pacific raceways last week on the highway this guy in a wrx sti drove up behind me and was riding my bumperfor a short time fed up with his arrogant behavior i dropped my 04 tls stick from 5th to 3rd hit the gas and left him in the dust and i didnt even have to floor it he finally caught up to me so i did it to him again 6th to 4th he never did pass me and im sure i ruined his day i wont say how fast i was going but the tl surprised even me two options here 1 the driver wasnt playing like you were\\n2 the guy didnt know how to use turbos your v6 with 238lbft of torque on a 3400 lb car really isnt a match for a person who knows how to use the sweet spot of their turbos on a car that sports 300 lbsft at 4000 rpm and the car weighs 200 lbs less in fact its a one sided affair i finally had a chance to watch the race this afternoon i taped it earlier this morning it was a very exciting race and also great to see a brand new car with little development time tsx do so well against the established benchmark 325i it was also interesting to note how evenly matched all of the cars in this competition are even though there is a combination of fwd and rwd and luxury bmw 325i vs economy nissan sentra which begs the question  if rwd vs fwd doesnt matter at sebring why do so many enthusiasts think it makes a difference on i90 3 could be another iteration of the old rope a dope game let some dope charge ahead and get nailed by the cop before you get there pretty easy to play just find somebody with a new car and act arrogant then see if they reciprocate the best place to prove a point with your right foot is at a race track what its like to have some jackass ride your bumper oh he was playing all right i expected him to outrun me it just didnt happen as for the onesided thing you severely underestimate the capability of the tl in fact a tl owner on another discussion board had his 6speed dynoed and it registered 282hp not 270hp could it be that the wrx is overrated and the tl underrated its like somebody is behind you so what you really have several choices you can ignore them and listen to the nice sterio you can slow down so they get tired and pass you you can take the next exitturn or you can floor it in an attempt to teach the arrogant so and so a lesson with your car oh he was playing all right i expected him to outrun me it just didnt happen as for the onesided thing you severely underestimate the capability of the tl in fact a tl owner on another discussion board had his 6speed dynoed and it registered 282hp not 270hp could it be that the wrx is overrated and the tl underrated  how does one measure the hp at the crank is there a special dyno for this is or did the tl owner do some funky math to get from the wheels to the crank my guess is the math involved to make the 282 leap is rather fuzzy at best the tl is one great value if you can stomach the wheel jerking from your hand once in a while but it is not sti beater if the sti was between 4500 and 7000 the whole time you would have seen nothing but fumes the power band of the tl is quite evident in the 50120 stats and 0100 i suggest you take a look at the sti stats for those metrics before you get too enthusiastic about the less than torque ridden 32 which begs the question  if rwd vs fwd doesnt matter at sebring why do so many enthusiasts think it makes a difference on i90  this explains much  i suggest anyone questioning rwd in context of freeway driving actually drive a decent rwd car on some back roads if someone thinks they are going to enjoy  let alone accept the seemingly foreign concept of throttle induced overteer on the highway i imagine they will be out of the genepool soon enough the oversteer i paid 35k for is never enjoyed on a highway  its enjoyed on the hairpins of an open field with a two lane country road with 10 foot tall cows and fog smoked expanses and no one in sightand carefully pressing the throttle just enough with just enough feedback to push the weight back to the rear wheels just as that very power causes them with buttery smooth finesse to slide into the perfect exit angle and keep traction where wide open throttle can push your back into the leather unless youve actually experienced this you will keep wondering this was gone over several timesscca adds balast to cars to make them competitive and each brand has a minimum weight its designed so as to make the drive the issue not the vehicle that being said i would look at a fwd car next  i like the new 93  since im willing to sacrifice soem handling for other attributes but i wouldnt feel the need to fool myself into thinking that wasnt doing so dave that being said i would look at a fwd car next  i like the new 93  since im willing to sacrifice soem handling for other attributes but i wouldnt feel the need to fool myself into thinking that wasnt doing so  there are some reasonable folks out there in this world there is nothing wrong with fwd and for most it will serve its purpose at least you understand that works great and suitable dont mean bettermany struggle here chris  i never denied that driving a rwd car wasnt satisfying i own a miata after all i just said that rwd has no significant performance advantage over a properly driven fwd car dhanley  all else being equal tires powerweight etc a rwd car and fwd car if properly driven will yield similar lap times the technique is a little different but the end result is the same bmws so conerned with brand image the 1 may not get released in the us without a 6 httpthecarconnectioncomindexasparticle6967 bmw 1series stuck one things for sure bmw is not planning on bringing its 1series to the us anytime soon reports published in recent days by detroit trade papers say that the company will either kill the us 1series project or delay it significantly based on comments made by tom purves ceo of bmw north america purves reportedly says that the case for bringing the smallest of bmwbadged vehicles to america is still being made and the company is deciding currently which iterations  coupe hatch or

inline six is likely if the vehicle ever shows up here jack gilbert a weak 4 cylinder could kill an image didnt the 318 snub asss already kill them back in 90s sorry but theres no way youre gonna convince me in a tl sporting a low torque honda engine like my low torque bmw engine stands a chance against a turbo 25 scoobie engine lighter more torque broader range i stand by my first two options and concur the third option may have been he wanted you to be the point man i do it all the time let someone lead the charge by a good 1514 of a mile and ill keep my eyes peeled for anyone blasting onto the freeway with lights blazing the tls a fantastic car i attended a preview showing the other day for an upcoming audi and among the other vehicles were the s60 e class tl and 530i id pick the tl over all of them and twice on sunday in fact i did continue to choose the tl even once theyd raised the price to 40k i really do respect the car inside and out but its not a barn burner like a sti could you put this discussion back on the cclass discussion list be that the c is definitely in this category\\nthanks blueguydotcom i more or less agree with you like i said i fully expected the sti to overtake mehe just couldnt im chalking it up to his limited driving skills and having lost his nerve believe me when i say he was trying to catch me nothing worse than seeing someone with a performance car and no idea how to extract that performance sometimes it is not that the person does not know how to use hisher vehicle to its full potential but they may not be willing to risk their life like some crazy kid would when i was a teenager i was willing to take more chances when driving my car than i do now why i usually did not considered the consequences and i had far less to lose when we were looking at wagons last year we looked at one once we saw the price with options the looking stopped curious on people impression on the drive yes my soon to be mother in law has one id rather have a v6 passat 5sp its quiet and fairly nice interior but very low on the mercedes quality scale and not to big not to mention the fact it just looks like a baby s class its ok but  so is the 28k passat for that matter the engine isnt bad but it doennt beg to be pushed like a g that for shore i drove one at the gm autoshowontheroad they had a loopy test track and a lot of cars to take out on it the c320 really handled better than i expected and was very refined it had a bit more nonmelodious engine noise than i expected i was surprised by that it was nice but it was also a 45k car the cts was there too it was nice but a bit too isolated for me i like quiet but i want to feel the road and hear the engine rev somehow the interior just seemed to whisper chevrolet it seemed spacious inside which probably appeals to other more than it does to me but if you like the interior and isolation this is probably a really good car drove the 95 aero that was probably my favorite i really like the looks interior the actual out the door price  they have 6000 in rebates on it now and sell at invoice  and i love the engine but it didnt handle as well as the cts or the c320 the 93 was there but it was the base 93 linear and didnt impress mostly due to the interior the engine needed more power but the handling was really quite good it tracked well and had good feedback i recently sat in a 93 convertable at the autoshow later and thought that the interior in it was really nice so maybe its improved also saw the s40 at the autoshow and the interior really looked cheap to me and there were several broken parts inside which i guess could have been due to its being a prototype and suffering autoshow abuse but based on the numbers this is a really good car so i would look at it again i drove an xtype 30 the car looks really good i thought and the interior is very attractive but again there were 3 demos at the dealer and 2 had broken parts inside  one had the cell phone cover broken by the dealership owner  all the driving controls felt too light to me and the engine despite its increased hp felt weak at low rpmsi didnt feel that i could pass on the highway without dropping out of fifth but i thought it sounded great when i revved it up i didnt feel that i got a lot of steering feedback but it was also impressively quiet on the highway the door sill was really high and the back doors only opened 45 degrees so it was hard for me to get in the back i drove a new 325i and its good but i couldnt help but feel that its been somewhat lexiified the shifter had vaguer detents and the engine noise and steering effort were dialed down i might have liked it a lot more if it had the sport package i dont like the newer bmw designs and i look askance at the increasing complexity of these cars i drove a g35 too it certainly had a lot of power and had pretty good feedback i was mostly turned off by the interior which i felt was pretty cheap and the amount of tire noise that got into the interior  too much for my tastes  also my friend who has one reports really poor mpg oh test drove the is300 as well i thought it looked  warning personal taste issue  tacky inside and was too consistently noisy due to road noise also the interior didnt fit my frame very well i thought several cars felt better handling around town drove a lastgen a4 18t overall thought it felt very composed and had a nice interior but it definitely needed more engine also a friend with a passat has had a dismal reliability experience but if i was leasing it from a subservient dealer i would probably feel ok about it the sporty acuras ive been in cls integrarsx ive had a hard time getting comfortable in so i havent even bothered to test drive them i havent looked at the new tls there was nothing that made me feel that i need to go out and trade my 328i but i want to test a 93 arc if i happen to be near a dealer with some free time i almost hope i hate it so i dont feel the urge to waste money on a car swap dave sounds like the c320 drives pretty nice albeit  thats great that you have had the chance for so many drives i have an aero wagon and as much as i like the car it does need some stiffer springs and stiffer rear sway bar to help the handles it tracks well but rough stuff in the canyons makes it hit the bump stops and there is more roll great brakes and isnt it fast 060 is alright but i tell you people 60120 in an aero is something else i wish they would bump up the power in the 95 aero all the saab tuners have emps to take it to 280300hp i think the 93 aero is a sweet looking car if they bumped it to 250250 it would be killer agree the c320 was nice but seemed expensive to me for what it wassolid quiet ok handling but not really extraordinary while having no glaring flaws i guess i didnt realize the price of the cts i drove i want to the caddy website and i see that was probably a 43k car  36l xenons upgraded sterio sunroof  but i suppose there will be many thousands off at some point the 95 was as you describeswayed more than i liked and understeer was very easy to provoke i didnt feel secure pushing it in turns its acceleration was soso 030 then after that really impressive to be blunt i thought it was a very wellthought out car suffering from an old chassis it could have used more suspension travel and structural ridgidity i expect the 93 areo will be 250hp beofre long the upcoming 93 hatch is supposed to get 250hp out of the same motor with direct injection you can already get a chip for that hp level but i shy away from mods and prefer to get the power stock any thoughts on the new tl seems like an awful lot of car for 33k id be dumb if i didnt test one before purchasing i cant imagine it not selling well with its power features and price it even has good epa numbers and impressive safety scores but i never even sat inside one so i have no constructive comments im trying to make it a new policy to consider if i really have something to say before saying something  red green show anyone i hear the kia spectra is on sale now so much for a rwd  nice shot of the tsx being lapped by the 3s for the second time  dhanley did the cts have the sport package or just luxury suspension differences plus 17 wheels make a big difference between the two although it is still somewhat isolated and roomy inside at 62 i like that feeling personally im more into the 5 seriesa6ctstl size than tsx3a4 even if the handling is number where are the gs for that picthey must be signing autographs already oh wait maybe they dont let gs out there with 318s and 20 litre acuras i think it had 16 inch rims so it was just luxury i certianly desire some degree of isolation the cts i drove just had too much for my tastes they probably chose the softer car intentionally for the typical driver im only 511 but because of my build and how i sit a lot of cars dont have enough headroom for me even the cls puts me into a posture i dont care to maintain my gripe with many modern seats is they seem either designed for the widening american population or a person with narrow shoulders dave the tripoint mazda team out of canoga park ca is another fwd power there 20l mazda 323 aka mp3 or now 3 is fwd and it won alot i beleive it finished second in 2003 to the bmw 328 team but not bad for a team with less than 3 years on the circuit and way less factory support rwd awd fwd whatever at our level as enthusiasts its all about the driver as nice as the infiniti and bmws are to drive the audi or tl can give a similar feel on a canyon road beleive me most of yall wont be sliding your tail around on any canyon roads you will be taking the same safe line of a fwd car you can drift if you wish and as cool as that feeling is it also makes you pucker for a moment so most people dont do it as someone who owns a protege i gotta say the handlings pretty darn good my car needs the strut tower and id prefer 17s over my skimpy 16 inch alloys but its lightyears beyond the civic jetta etc the big problem with that car no guts under the hood touring series proven again and again that rwd does not have an advantage even on the race track fwd cant handle high hp and torque but in entry level luxury its not an issue fwd cant handle high hp and torque but in entry level luxury its not an issue    this level has 270 base hp for that car it surpassed imo the threshold at 220hp in the next 2 years the entry lux cars will have 300hp to even compete  new 3 sure will and possibly the 05 g sedanor has this been quashed yet also some race track certainly favor fwd cars and some fwd cars have no understeer since they are so finely and hard tuned and they can even get oversteer in some setups cant they what most suggest is that the balance from a rwd setup is superior for street cars and that the fun one has while playing with oversteer in the twisties is way more fun than getting torque feedback in your steering i would prob take an rsx over the 3 in that racegreat car understeer and oversteer are both a loss of control on the track or on the street neither one is a good thing the ideal car is neutral handling all the way to the limit yes it may be fun to play with throttle induced oversteer and perhaps drift your car through a corner but if youre doing this on public roads i hope youve driven the road 1000 times walked it right before you drive to check for new hazards such as gravel potholes debris etc that werent there before and block off the road at both ends to prevent another car from coming around a corner from the other direction while your coming off an apex and tracking out your fantasy is nice and im sure you enjoy occasionally inducing the back end of your g to get a little loose and rotate towards some imagined apex who doesnt but thats hardly a defining rwd sport sedan moment i can and do enjoy the same effect in my fwd honda dont misunderstand me i understand where youre coming from from your last post i can see that you understand me too my response is mostly directed towards those people that continually spout the superiority of rwd over fwd with drivel such as the front wheels have to steer and driveits much for them to handle or true sports cars can only be rwd without understanding the mechanics of car control or vehicle dynamicsits pure nonsense control your car drive smoothly follow the proper line and youll go fast and never upset the balance of the car be it a bmw or acura my bias for rwd comes from that ethereal shove i get when exploding out of a corner just right hit the corner perfectly you feel yourself pressed down and back in your seat ah not much like it ive yet to find that in a fwd car yes it may be fun to play with throttle induced oversteer and perhaps drift your car through a corner but if youre doing this on public roads i hope youve driven the road 1000 times walked it right before you drive to check for new hazards such as gravel potholes debris etc that werent there before and block off the road at both ends to prevent another car from coming around a corner from the other direction while your coming off an apex and tracking out your fantasy is nice and im sure you enjoy occasionally inducing the back end of your g to get a little loose and rotate towards some imagined apex who doesnt but thats hardly a defining rwd sport sedan moment i can and do enjoy the same effect in my fwd honda ummm i do this 2x a week at least on exit and entrance ramps i can see 360 degrees around i keep the car loose for about 78 seconds all the way around balancing the oversteer and understeer to find the edge of traction  this helps me undertand the limits of the car and how the car reacts to all kinds of inputs a little spin out which really wont happen with vdc on is gonna cause me no problems other than some grass in my springs yu dont have to induce oversteer to get what bluguy describesthe shove it is something that does define the sports sedans i want to drive  in fact it defines it in such a way that i will never pay more than 20k for a fwd car  more like 18 really as far as oversteer you realize that even without pushing the traction limit your car will slide if rwd in a turnnot much but when the front wheels are turning one way and the other wheels are driving a differnt angle  somthing gives and i assure you its the rear wheels as they align themselves to the direction of travel to the fronttheres just something about the balance you feel as the weight transfers and you propel shove down the straight road puit of a turn no accord can do this man  im not sure you really know what this is about my tl shoving me back in my seat when i accelerate out of a turn into a straightaway or whenever the drivetrain is important but it goes hand in hand with the chassis and suspension thus we have awesome drivers with awd  audi a4 quatto subaru legacy rwd  bmw 325330 infiniti g35 lexus is300 fwd  acura tl saab 93 aero all of these vehicles are fun to fling around corners i have no problem with putting my money on any of them is that what those rwd bmws are doing in the race photo above are they shoving themselves around the race trackbehind that fwd tsx \\na picture is worth a thousand words the green flag dropsthe bs stops lol raher good point i wonder what went wrong with those 17 superior rwd cars 24l tsx engine vs 25l 325i engine and still managed to outrun 14 of them wow so much for a rwd theory who overlapped who this whole discussion of auto racing reminds me of the frothing folks on bimmerfest harassing me to join their little autocross garbage btw i woulda bought a tsx over a 325i better car and better value in my eyes youre not giving your tl wot out of a corner youd end up fighting massive torque steer  assuming the engines in the sweet spot which it should be outa the corner i could point out yet again that scca handicaps cars but it would be nice of you guys to acknowledge that i exist in your little universe by perhaps calling me a name or something i wont be making any assumption until i see another picture of this with tl instead of tsx otherwise id be eating my own words like others no theory yet but i drove integra gsr and i know which one is better gtg blueguydotcom you obviously dont know what youre talking about massive torque steer doesnt exist in the tl there is torque steer but its mild and easily handled youre right my bad torque steer i know its perfectly acceptable to you that the car attempt to redirect itself when accelerating at wot to each his own issue with decent handling powerful fwders normally isnt oversteer or understeer but torque steer laws of physics drive wheel and steering wheels one and the same plus front heavy tl maxima etc all afflicted question of extent not existence what is up with the discussion tied to racing and tracks cars used for racing normally heavily modified esp in areas related to handling major tire and suspension mods everything from shocks antisway bars cross bracing bushings etc not to mention that race tracks arent like regular roads rwd might be more fun for some people to drive but oversteer just like understeer makes one loose time tsx and 325 is about the same size and weight engines about the same size too and both vehicles manage to post similar lap times big plus for acura is that they build two different near luxury cars tsx and tl instead of settle for one platform like bmw and mb did i know acura officials said that tl was build as a competition for 5 series but we all know that size and price wise it should and is being compared with 3series new rl on the other hand should be grate competition for 5 and e do you have phd in physics what kind of law is that i know physics well but never heard of such law\\nyou can probably steer your car and shift gears at the same time according to your logic it should be to much to handle we all should be drivin at than as mentioned hp to weight ratio and gearing can really make a difference in who gets to a corner first once you get there you can block the folks behind you at the point where they may have a handling advantage as long as you can cary enough exit speed to win the race between corners and have the brakes to stay there you can make it really hard for somebody to pass you cleanly track configuration can also favor one car over another to really make a fwd race car work you have to have some lift throttle oversteer we used to trail brake and run more air pressure in the rear tires to get more oversteer once you get back on the gas the car pushes hard so you take an earlier apex than a rwd car induce some oversteer via lift throttle andor trail braking then stand on the gas and let the car understeer out from the apex of the corner with some practice and the right balance it can be a lot of fun if you dont overheat the front tires or brakes during the race when were looking at cars we tested the xtype i like the exterior but the inside wasnt impressive but not as bad as the mondeotaurus people are making it out to be i hope they can fix this car i read this from autospies hot xtype r seen testing\\n \\nthe long awaited xtype r model due late 2004 or early 2005ish has been seen cruising the west midlands of england during final testing the fourwheel drive r will have the latest version of jaguars v6 engine using some form of forced induction to give it 330 bhp and 330 lb ft of torque there has been some whispers that the engine might not follow the usual supercharged r formula for it could well be turbocharged instead due to a lack of space under the compact saloons bonnet the 30litre engine could also be expanded to 32 litres and 250bhp an upgrade likely to debut in the whole xtype range\\n \\n060 acceleration is said to be around the fivesecond mark and top speed nudging 165 mph jaguars new sixspeed manual or sixspeed automatic transmission will be standard though no news on a tiptronicsmg style box  jaguar preferring the jgate the r will stand out with its enlarged bumpers huge exhaust pipes mesh front grille dechromed exterior and 19inch alloy wheels but no silly body kit or boot spoilers unlike the other rs it will not have any additional air intakes on its bonnet internally the car will remain the same as the other models save for materialwood differences until the whole car gets a face lift in 2006 sorry to ignore you its just that your handicap theory doesnt make one bit of difference the scca rules are not used in the speed challenge but speed challege has its own rules to make the racing tight and exciting by equalizing the various cars thus the 325i and tsx begin with similar powerweight and the same tires brand size and compound the cars in this series are indeed heavily modified for racing but the fact remains that fwd is fwd and rwd is rwdand they both perform is fwd was truly inferior in some way then realtime racing could have entered a bmw instead of the acura they chose the tsx because of its an outstanding platform to build a race car on you realize that even without pushing the traction limit your car will slide if rwd in a turn if your tires are gripping then you arent sliding and if youre a good driver your car is always set so that each tire is getting maximum contact with the road i get much more satisfaction from nailing the apex perfectly and tracking out with the car in perfect balance what youre describing is no more exciting than doing burnouts at streetlights pg48477 if you want to learn more about torque steering in powerful fwders then just read about any review of the maxima tl sentra ser spec v neon srt4 manufacturers try to overcome the laws of physics related to this problem by many things two most basic are 1 lsd critical for powerful fwders and equal length halfshafts if one wheel transmits more power to the ground than the other it will pull the fwd car to one side because the drive wheels are also the steering wheels everything that is good on your bmw or acura was developed at the race track it is the test bed for future production improvements like brembo brakes\\n there are lots of reasons one brand wins over the other at the racetrack better driver better car better set up and that last and most importantmore money  i am always concerned to read about the road racers out there on the highway drifting through off ramps and on ramps there is only one place to test the limits of your vehicle and also find out exactly who you are at the wheelthe track\\nit is the only place you can go with your car where no one tells you how fast you can go\\ni respect the opionions of those posting here who have obviously have had experience driving where things are only limited by your own limits\\nlots of interesting back and forth in this board i guess you dont have phd in physics just so you know when you turn left weight shifts to the right so you right tires has more traction does not matter fwd or rwd as far as i know lsd is widely used in many rwd cars for the same reasons as fwd cars the bottom line is in this class of cars near luxury performance with hp than 300 rwd will not give you advantage over fwd one have to drive fwd and rwd different at the end lap times are the same here i am red tsx going through turn 3 at pacific raceways it is the only place you can go with your car where no one tells you how fast you can go\\ni respect the opionions of those posting here who have obviously have had experience driving where things are only limited by your own limits \\nan unpopular view thats any road dont bother with flames about selfishness legality or responsibility if you think that japanese engineer were stupid enough to put more horsepower to a fwd car without improving the cars handling ability think again it used to be a fact that a fwd couldnt handle higher hp but not with todays technology at least to some extent why tsx defied the law of physics science and new technology are the keys the world was considered flat too in the old days fedlawman the reason people keep saying about this rwd theory bcuz they havent owned and driven the car to its limit dont just drive a fwd drive an acura not maxima why not just drive a kia rio for a comparison blueguy about massive torque steer is that a fact or just a myth you seem to me like an expert on the new tl do you own one i dont own one and i highly doubt owning a car makes a person any more an expert on it than seeing one drive down the street i know many many people with bmws who couldnt even tell you if its fwd or rwd they can write the check each month that doesnt mean squat btw the tsx i drove did exhibit torque steer i dug the car regardless as ive said many times had i not bought my 330i the tsx was the next choice if the tl had been available when i bought i very well might have an acura in the garage right now unless bmw decides to release an m version of the 1 series its looking more and more likely in 2006 ill defect to another maker quite possibly acura if your tires are gripping then you arent sliding and if youre a good driver your car is always set so that each tire is getting maximum contact with the road\\ni get much more satisfaction from nailing the apex perfectly and tracking out with the car in perfect balance what youre describing is no more exciting than doing burnouts at streetlights this is making me weary  dont take it from me  take it from thousands of publications and books such as solo racing instuctional manuals or guides that the perfect turn in a rwd car involves slight and intended rear wheel slide just a touch now  its not a burnout smokeout like some who have never driven a rwd hard suggest the point at which your front wheels have pushed the car to another angle while the rear wheels are driven with throttle input to the former angle there will and is a correction at higher speed that induced oversteer which is limited to exactly the right amount becasue the weight transfers to the rear where the driven wheels are and traction is regained this takes timing anyone who drives a fwd and preaches that this beautiful method of driving is like teen fun in a parking lot should get a refund and drive a bike i have suggested that on the track a fwd can have its place and setups and drivers can compensate for anything with nonstreet suspsensions who gives a crud about the track this is about what my family sedan can do in a turn that some never may understand i could care less whose faster i dont even race or go to the track i want tourque and throttle induced oversteer corrections in the most perfectly balanced car maybe ever made here is the crux of your argument traction loss is bad wrong  heres why rwders understand that this correction is intended because the momentum loss in the turn is way less if the rear wheels simply slide a bit as opposed to entering the turn at a lower speed and not having any traction lost when this slide is complete the car actually gets the traction started again from the throttle pushing the weight back in a perfectly balanced and timed and heavenly turn without any momentum lost its like a airforce guy telling a navy skipper how to drive a ship this very argument contains the reasons why imo its worth all the money i put into the g every month if there were only fwd cars i would buy a duplex or something danny1878 in comparison to more powerful cars like the tl maxima seville etc the 4cyl tsx lacks the power to generate a ton of torque steer but there still is some pg48477 do your own test take a powerful front driver out for a spin make a couple of quick standing starts akin to 060 mph test first take your hands off the steering wheel the accelerate hard see where the car goes watch what is happening to the steering wheel next do it with your hands very lightly on the wheel finally with your hands very firmly on the wheel the tugging of the steering wheel indicates torque steer by the wheels which do double duty in regards to both steering and powering at same time most pronounced in cars with more powerdelivery efficient manual transmissions ats sap some power to the wheels one of the best practical articles on this subject is cds comparison a few years ago of the rwd 330ci to the fwd cl types 6speed manual their cl had the then new lsd which made a huge world of improvement well designed powerful fwder will use lsd and equal length half shafts to minimize torque steer oh you mean sir i was wondering if pacific raceways was indeed sir and the photo of you in turns 3 and 4 confirms it my motorcycle racing career ended right about where the car behind you isgot knocked down and run over from behind left in an ambulance and the wife levied that me or motorcycle racing thing on me i raced bicycles there for a few years also\\nwho was sponsoring the event for you guys to be on the track or was it an actual race  regardless of the  i am the ultimate street racer and dont need to go to the track dissertations i see herei will look for them in the weeds or in the hospital as you pointed out earlierit is only a matter of time until something on the car breaks or there is a loss of traction or a million other reasons why things eventually end up badly for street racers in their perfectly balanced cars often it ends up badly for those they include in their mishaps regardless of the  i am the ultimate street racer and dont need to go to the track dissertations i see herei will look for them in the weeds or in the hospital as you pointed out earlierit is only a matter of time until something on the car breaks or there is a loss of traction or a million other reasons why things eventually end up badly for street racers in their perfectly balanced cars yah thats the ticketturn what i said into something it is not i do not race and i do not street race what dont you get here man you clearly do not comprehend or understand the concepts being discussed noone loses traction in an apex for more than a few inches  if you do you hit trees and stuff there are huge areas for some people to make mistakes and make bad judgements and for one to assume they know that all rwd cars have to be unsafe and will be at the edge of that grey area is absurd or a weak attempt to mask the fact that you never have experienced what keeps entire companies from going the way of honda fwd despite its popularity stemming from cost manufacturing effeciency and cost reductions fwd is cheaper and a fad of the post embargo  and a dying breed if you dont have it you dont understand it apparently i find it ironic that a car that has the steering wheel shake like a leaf when thrusting out of a turn to hard is somehow even presumed to be safer than anything other than the space shuttle what i dont get is where you see anything in my previous post about fwd rwd awd or any wheel drive maybe you could point that out for me im responding to a notion that the prefectly balanced car drivers will be in the weeds or the hospitalthe ones that are perfectly balanced are rwd in my reference so you are inderectly suggesting that we rwder are headed for the weeds if we enjoy our cars whatever floats your boat the idea that a g or 3 cant be enjoyed for the perfection in its ourright platform design without risking property and life is laughable chris  i think were getting caught up in semantics here im not suggesting that what you are describing is somehow reckless or dangerous i do understand the delicate line that you are talking about and how you induce this with judicious application of throttle to rotate the car i have owned a miata for 10 years and still enjoy this what im trying to tell you is that this effect is not exclusive to rwd platforms although a well balanced fwd car can be made to oversteer with liftthrottle you can also rotate the rear end of a fwd car with a gentle application of power to see feel this in action run a fwd car through a slalom course when you gently press the gas and feel the rear end tuck in and rotate around the cone youll know what im talking about its different than a rwder and not exactly the same as riding the threshold like your talking about but it is no less entertaining or effective i think that rwd loyalists tend to get caught in a reardrive paradigm sometimes because its simply the way its always been and the way most of us learned to drive way back when yes i love driving the miata to experience tha classic dynamics of a rwd sports car but driving my fwd tsx is no less challenging or entertaining if youve never explored the limits of a well tuned fwd sports car then your missing out on something special then again if your satisfied with what youve got and dont care to try something new then thats fine too believe me im not trying to discredit your comments because i do think they are valid i am simply trying to point out that fwd has no inherent performance limitations compared to rwd its just two ways to reach the same resultvive la difference i have never experienced torque steer in my tsx maybe its because i drive with my hands on the wheel sorry to hear about your mishap that first hairpin into turn 3 coupled with the downhill slope can be wicked deceptive on entry yes the name was changed from sir to pacific raceways a couple of years ago i love driving it because of the challenging turns coupled with elevation changes its a great training ground for improving driving skills i went out with the puget sound bmw cca who puts on track events several times each year i know the porsche club and alfa romeo club also sponsor events throughout the year between pr and bremerton the clubs also trip down to laguna seca and portland during the year but i havent gone the only perfectly balanced car is the one thats parked its different than a rwder and not exactly the same as riding the threshold like your talking about but it is no less entertaining or effective i think that rwd loyalists tend to get caught in a reardrive paradigm sometimes because its simply the way its always been and the way most of us learned to drive way back when\\nyes i love driving the miata to experience tha classic dynamics of a rwd sports car but driving my fwd tsx is no less challenging or entertaining if youve never explored the limits of a well tuned fwd sports car then your missing out on something special then again if your satisfied with what youve got and dont care to try something new then thats fine too ive had 5 honda acura products that i put to death most were well worn when i got em over 10 years i know all about oversteer in a front driver ive spent more time in front than rear wheel in fact im quite satisfied with what i have now as we all seem to be its not about challenging or entertaining its about knowing both types of platforms and prefering one over the other i would think an rsx is very tossable and way fun but to drive it would mean giving up something that is way too important to most serious sports sedan drivers regardless of our intentions to race or win somethingits about physics and working with forces as opposed to against them as fwd put the steering and drivepower at odds after 10 years of crxs and integras and passats that were quite fun to drive i cant tell you how nice it is to finally again not have to drive into a corner concerned that my front wheels wont be able to turn if pushed with vdc this may not be a problem but for me the whole issue is the inherint limitations that dont exist in rwd what im trying to tell you is that this effect is not exclusive to rwd platforms what is exclusive is the momentum one can have going in and out and the line you use and the way in which one can be certain that a bit of gas before the exit is good for traction in rwd and bad for fwd the throttle app to gain traction right as you exit is the money and cant be enjoyed in front drives otherwise wed all be in friont drives  they are cheaper to build the only perfectly balanced car is the one thats parked  you actually hit on something the g designers had in mind when they decided on the ultimate distribution the g is a 52f 48r such that when you hit the throttle in the sweet spot of the apex the entire thrust of this whole argument the weight shift back to a perfect 5050 when a fwd car pushed the gas all the weight goes away from the drive wheels rsx can still be fun but these finely tweaked and enjoyable rwd cars are built for getting around curves a particular waythe same way as ferrari porsche bmw chrysler dodge ford lambo some may be more than i can pay but the infiniti designers spent alot of money to make sure we can do this noone should buy a rwd if they dont want this if they do they dont have to risk anything to enjoy it i have 19k on my original brakes  maybe i need to spend more time enjoying the perfection fedlawman does your tsx have automatic or manual transmission what does a tsx weigh with full tank of gas and driver on board somewhere around 3500 pounds you likely dont personally experience any torque steer due to the lack of power esp little torque would it even have 170 wheel hp how much torque and hp does its small motor produce at 3k 35k and 4k rpms even pretty brutal high rpm 060 mph launch cant get too much power to the front wheels that is where it counts you cant expect a small 4cyl engine that needs to rev high for best output to compare with the output of the much bigger engines in powerful fwders like tl maxima seville etc wonder what the power to weight ratios are for your tsx and the neon srt4 read reports that dyno shows the dodge engine is being underrated by dc fedlawman laughing doesnt do much for the lack of power in the tsxs engine its small 4cylinder just cant compare to engines in cars like tl maxima g35 etc are you sad your car cant generate sufficient torque steer are you sad i find 060 in 72 secs and the 14 mile in 156 secs cd july 2003 perfectly satisfying i guess i should ask you the same question huh no need to get personal folks i noticed in the rt review of the tl manual they mentioned they got their best 0 and 14 times by doing a drop clutch launch at 4000 rpms ouch 4k launch isnt bad really im not saying its good for it but consider some other cars take the subaru wrx celica gts or honda s2000 all from reviews i have seen need to be clutch dropped from near redline to get the best numbers possible heck to get the best times out of my automatic s70 t5 you need to stand on the brake and wind it up to 3k3500 and let go according to rt the best 060 times with the new rx8 were achieved with a drop clutch at a teeth clenching 8000rpm  now that is white knuckle time never buy a car that has been used as a test car by the auto mags  best regards\\nshipo let that also inlcude demo sports carssport sedans fedlawman torque steer is problematic with fwders esp powerful ones like tl maxima seville etc not nearly as problematic with lowerpowered 4cyl fwd cars like tsx how could i be sad i have rwd 5speed manual and lsd i smile every time i drive if new rl is awd as in rumored then it could only means one thing honda wholeheartedly agrees with you i dont understand why acura has never offered a rwd sedan not that they have done badly with the tl on the contrary but they are now pushing the envelope with fwd im not sure why they havent switched yet either or at least given up the awd version for those of us who detest fwd not much keener on awd but itd be easier to live with day in and out no no we are not going to go there in this discussion for general debate about how many and which wheel drive is the best feel free to join the fwd vs rwd vs awd discussion and carry it on but we need to keep this sedans comparisons board discussion focused on the vehicles themselves which and how many wheel drive each offers is certainly relevant here but an extended debate about which is better in general is already taking place at that link and thats where that sort of debate belongs okeydokey well i can live without rwd and 5 speed but i gotta agree with you on the lsd what would it cost acura and bmw to include it in their carsmaybe 100 a serious oversight for any car in this class ill take my 270hp 6speed tl with lsd and brembos over any underpowered rwd lexus or bmw any day of the week underpowered is relative cd reported a 56 time to 60 for the 3 series with m3 like handling that doesnt seem underpowered to me of course bmw offers a variety of models body styles and tops i saw a tl in traffic sitting next to a dodge intrepid  theyre like twins all the tl has is a 270hp engine  a lot of gadgets nothing exiting the last mag comparo i read placed the tl 3rd to the g35  3 series the now 4 year old is placed 4th but rated higher than the tl in the fun to drive factor handling  chassis performance id rather have a great handling rwd car that just needs a little boost in power power is easy aneasy fix in a car whats harder to do is to make a car like the tl that has good hp but very mediocre in handling  to try to make that fwd car handle  drive better than an is a g35 or 3 series if what you said is true then we might see a sales drop on tl lets see in 3 days time japanese engineer put more hp but forgot to upgrade its handling lol you are funny oniac how about cr mag who placed the tl 1st over 330i motorweek motoring tv all of them place tl 1st only one mag placed tl 3rd sorry i dont even know where is was i never like the car you may say tls handling is very mediocre bcuz you dont own one if you think is is better why tl sells more than is g 3s maybe they dont buy your theory to each his own i really dont understand how sales numbers determines which car is superior popularity sure but better handling or performance by using sales figures the accord and camry blow away the tl do you think that either of those cars is better than the tl is a tl a better performing car than a ferrari or lamborghini because they sell more im not flaming you i just dont get your reasoning many people in here seem to bring up sales numbers often they reason people buy the best productthus the success of mcdonalds and titanic naturally joe blow gravitates toward the best product btw did someone say the bmw is slow okey dokey ill remember that tomorrow when playing around with my car in this forum to use terms like slow mediocre underpowered small etc is just ignorant the 170 hp a4 18t is neither slow nor underpowered the tls handling is certainly better than mediocre the c230k engine is not small every car in this class is capable of above average acceleration and handling and possesses poise balance elegance and luxury that trumps the average commuter car sure a honda accord v6 can outrun an audi a4 in a straight line however the accord does not handle as well look as good offer certain luxury features and it isnt as exclusive these characteristics are what define this class of carsits about the total package how about cr mag who placed the tl 1st over 330i you are correct but what did it place it in first for not for handling however handling is just one characteristic of a car people value different aspects of a cars nature notice the lexus es330 was down on the list has nothing to do with how the car sells or how good a car is in the publics perception or what we think of a car here at edmunds that is only crs opinion of a car i like cr but when making a car buying decision i leave home without it fedlawman for once we concur completely you wrote these characteristics are what define this class of carsits about the total package but the total package is the whole nine yards it includes price\\nequipment\\nbasic platform\\nacceleration handling braking steering\\nreliabilityquality\\nwarranty\\nownership costs\\nsafety\\ndepreciationresale value\\nfunctionalitypracticalityutility\\nsalesservice experience it is as a total package that the is300 shines great price great standard hid and optional equipment lsd great platform including rwd irs and manual transmission great overall performance fantastic reliabilityquality great warranty both btob and powertrain with optional mfr extension to btob good ownership costs though insurance a bit too high great safety including crash test results decent depreciation good practicality if a bit smallish one of the best salesservice experiences in the industry it is the little things that can make the big difference can you get lsd mine does does your manufacturer sell its own extended btob warranty mine does out to 7yr100k its great that is300 fullfils your needs the negatives why i personally would not consider an is are as follows 1 unlexus like interior the word corolla comes to mind\\n2 boy racer styling subjective but it is not my cup of tea\\n3 bang for the buck considering that a more powerful g35 can be had for the same money makes the is300 slightly overpriced saw a tl in traffic sitting next to a dodge intrepid  theyre like twins do us other drivers on the road a favor and get your eyes checked out as far as total packages go the g35 and the tl blow the is completely out of the water into outer space as for sales figures if the cars compared are closely matched in terms of category class equipment price range etc then sales figures are very relevant in determining a cars overall success and at close to 7000 units per month the tl is king of course you are completely correct and that is why the is300 is the perfect car for you i strongly considered the is300 too but not to sound like a broken record i didnt like the boy racer styling either and the relatively cheap and contrived interior turned me off my tsx has 99 of the performance of the is300 yet has a much nicer and higher quality interior imo a smoother quieter ride on the highway imo and a more dynamic and exciting enginetransmission combo imo lets face it no one car is better than another car here so stop trying to convince everyone that the is300 is the cats meow for you it may be but i took a passdifferent strokes sales figures reflect how any automobile is being received by the consumer in the long run they determine whether any model continues in production based on the manufacturers defined return on investment sales determine whether a manufacturer makes changes to an existing model to improve sales or whether they decide to introduce a new model\\nsales figures certainly do not denote superiority in terms of styling performance handling etc but they do denote what combination of these the consumer prefers the wholesale increase in hp across most of the models in this discussion is an example i am amused by the comments i see here insinuating that joe blow buys mediocre cars and some individuals are above that because they buy cars that they have somehow defined as different superiority in the marketplace is what every manufacturer is seeking that marketplace is however defined differently by different manufacturers ferrari does not have the same sales goals as honda nissan toyota but they do have some numbers they want to meet in order to maintain their place in whatever market they decide is important to them\\nyou cant discount sales as a very important indicator the reference to mcdonalds is an attempt to deride one of the most globally successful businesses it doesnt matter if joe blow eats there and you dont other businesses would kill for mcdonalds success in their market freedom of choice is a wonderful thing the marketplace inevitably determines what survives and sales figures are the feedback from the marketplace to the manufacturers it will also inevitably determine what you get on your new car in the future navigation systems werent on any cars a few years ago\\nthe sales figures for the new tl reflect an acceptance on the part of the consumer that acura is on the right track with their blend of styling handling performance etc\\nthe new acuras will drive changes to bmw  nissan  toyota and others just as they drove the changes to the new tl competition is also a wonderful thing the consumer wins in the end\\nmost of the discussion on this board is my car is better than your car supported by whatever article personal experience or personal opinion the author chooses to use to attempt to justify their position no one is right and no one is wrong since none of it can really be objectively substantiated\\nit is always interesting to hear from the participants here however and many of the opinions are put forth from an obvious informed background i learn a lot here and also laugh a lot\\ngod bless the internet you can always bring up accord camry or mcdonald but the fact is they are in different market segments if you want to buy a 33k40k car would certainly expect good features good handling good performance will they buy an accordcamry nope bcuz they expect more than that with that much money so if you say sales fgures has nothing to do with quality buy some marketing books if you were a car manufacturer would you produce a car where you dont need to sell it not with lexus bmw or infinity they wont survive if if they dont sell the car if im not mistaken there seem to be some justasequally partisan supporters of the tsx tl and g35 not to mention 3 series on this board nothin wrong with that just as long as we all get to speak peacefully isnt that part of the purpose of this board to share you enthusiasm for a particular marque and model we wont convince the converted but there are a ton of people who are still looking trying to make a decision fedlawman you seem to be doing a great job trying to convince everyone that the tsx is the cats meow ill second your own words in this area for you it may be but i took a passdifferent strokes too little careuroderived honda accord fwd and 4cylfor too much money if i had to go fwd 4cyl guess id rather have a nissan sentra ser spec v or srt4 if you want to buy a 33k40k car would certainly expect good features good handling good performance good point danny and every manufacturer mentioned thus far excels in one area or another nobody excels at everything some people look at the total package others are more selective and buy for a characteristic or two that is why do people get ferraris and huge suvs based on one or two characteristics hope i dont have to spell em out getting an es330 or a tl or an is probably involves a number of characteristics weighted averaged in the buyers mind and then rated i really dont understand how sales numbers determines which car is superior popularity sure but better handling or performance does it make sense that a car is very popular and has a big hit in its sales because of \\n1 the car doesnt perform well\\n2 bad handling\\n3 cant even handle a corner do you think those 7000 peoplemonth were all stupid enough not to see that performance does include acceleration 060 010014 mile top speed etc i definitely fall into the total package category which is why i chose the tl with the g35 being a close 2nd the interior thing bmw fell short in the value department some who are hung up on rwd wouldnt even consider an acura and thats fine for them others have needs of prestige and will only look at bmw or mb etc life would be pretty boring if we all chose the one car in this class that suited everybodys needs fortunately that car doesnt exist and hopefully never will the audi a4 18t over the tsx granted the tsx was probably faster and more reliable but the audis styling was nicer it handled better and looked and felt a lot more luxurious than the accordlike tsx lets face it folks when buying a car the intangibles sometimes play a bigger role in the decision making than the quantifiable part to me the a4 felt special it made my pulse quickenthats what its all about to truly enjoy what you drive you seem to be doing a great job trying to convince everyone that the tsx is the cats meow as youve pointed out partisanship is fine and to a certain extent expected when car enthusiasts get together to talk about cars and in particular their cars i am happy with my tsx and when a significant tidbit comes along 1 speed challenge success and 2 my track day of course i let folks knowthats what this forum is for i dont think a couple of posts are excessive and i think they were informative and interesting on the other hand in addition to your weekly the is300 is the best choice in this segment comments you also litter this forum with comments that berate the cars that other enthusiasts love how about i just agree with you that the is300 is the finest car in this segment and it is superior to all the other cars on the list because they each have at least one of the following failings lack lsd underpowered unreliable fwd too expensive not a lexus not 5050 weight distribution plagued with torque steer 4 cylinder automatic not a premium marque fedlawman play nice berate litter ignorant those are your words you seem to get upset if anyone points out that the tsx is a europeanderived honda accord fwd and 4cyl i couldnt imagine having one that was an automatic it is what it is just as the is300 is derived from the toyota altezza too bad we cant get the is200 6speed manual version in usa we all love the cars we do for many and varied reasons im a strong proponent of a ton of cars ive owned and enjoyed g20 323i is300 ls8 and many more im not set in my ways nor inherently or permanently partial to any one marque or model im not suggesting that people who buy a tl are stupid personally i think it is a fine car and my opinion has nothing to do with sales figures even if they only sold 1000 of them per month i would still feel the same way bmw sells far less m3s per month so that makes it a lesser car not by my way of thinking\\ndoes it make sense that a car is very popular and has a big hit in its sales because of \\n1 the car doesnt perform well\\n2 bad handling\\n3 cant even handle a corner\\nevidently this is quite true in regards to the camry and accord hence i personally base my taste in automobiles on what i like not on what is the most popular again i am not flaming you or the tl are we supposed to be comparing supply and demand curves or which cars can take which curvy roadswhile there is some value in this microeconomic discussion i think we will all agree that none of these cars are edsels although i must tell you that i compared the i35 to the 04 tl and the infiniti salesman was falling all over himself to spark my interest in an 03 i35 even though 04 i35s were in the showroom now there is probably something to be said for those cars that have more demand than supply and something else to be said for those cars that have more supply than demand the raw sales totals of any given month for any given model are more or less meaningless unless you know what businessmarketing model the manufacturer has chosen for that model the fact that bmw could sell more m3s than it chooses to produce and acura can sell more tls with nav than it can produce tells us nothing more than that the market sees both cars favorably now for example if bmw is not meeting its 3series sales goals since the 04 acura tl was introduced thats a different story altogether btw i have no idea if that is the case its probably more like infiniti success with the g35 hurting the i35 is honda seeing demand soften for the v6 accord since the tl was introduced that is just a guess  the price points being so disparate would tend to work against that hypothesis from a microeconomic perspective first of all let me apologize if i have mistakenly interpreted your comments as inflamatory if that wasnt your intention now my response you do know that the is300 and tsx both weigh about 3250 lbs right you must also know that the is300 and tsx both do 060 560 14 mile skidpad and slalom within a hair of each other in spite of the fact that you once said the is300 offers near 330i performance luxury and equipment for 325i price surely you will admit that regardless of layout the tsx is a fine performance sedan both on the street and at the track you should also admit that the subtleties between fwd and rwd and the inclusion or omission of lsd is more significant to a sports car discussion than an entrylux performance sedan discussion since neither issue is a factor until youre driving above 810ths now if you simply prefer the way rwd works and feels well thats fine but when you insist that the small 4cyl engine in the acura lacks torque or that the fwd 4cyl tsx and 93 set the bare minimum for this category you come across as a car snob putting others down because they drive an inferior car remember when you peppered that xtype owner with oneyears worth of magazine reviews from european car mt rt cd to prove that the xtype wasnt as good as he thought how do you think it made him feel remember when you stated that you wish we had three boards one for fwd one for awd and one for rwd for me there is no such thing as a performance fwder that is an oxymoron why wouldnt you want to compare the tsx 93 325i and is300 on the same board they are objectively identical in size luxury comfort and performance capabilities to exclude a car because of its supposed inferior layout is akin to wanting the black kids to sit in the back of the school bus because you dont want to be seen associating with them anyways i know its easy to misinterpret comments posted here because you dont hear what theyre saying again i apologize if i have misunderstood your intentions and taken them too personallyjust consider that i may not be the only one who feels this way the 170 hp a4 18t is neither slow nor underpowered bull straight up i owned a jetta 18t which is lighter than an a4 and it was a slow car ive driven every a4 type  not including the obviously different s4 and the a4 just doesnt have any guts whats slow anything that takes more than 6 65 seconds to hit 60 if you take 7 seconds to hit 60 then the car has average power whats average falling into the 8040 percentile which is in my book the same as failing if the altima and accord can scamper to 60 in under 7 i expect so can a sports sedan the tls handling is certainly better than mediocre heck it supposedly handles better than a tsx and i thought the tsx was a sharp handling little car the c230k engine is not small the 230 is just not up to snuff imho to each his own lets face it no one car is better than another car here so stop trying to convince everyone that the is300 is the cats meow for you it may be but i took a passdifferent strokes i agree with that some people feel they must bring up sales numbers to justify what they like this akin to looking to mags and saying x writer in xx mag says its good too great for the other buyers and professionals does that mean those of us who didnt pick the experts choice the tl according to some the bmw to others or choose the car 7000 people bought last month weve made the wrong decision how can it be a bad decision if were happy with what we own theres a weird vibe on this board and it seems to come from a desire by some people to have the cool car or to pick the car 5 out of 6 dentists would own whats wrong with loving what we bought btw im glad theres a tsx owner here mentioning that great car as for sales figures if the cars compared are closely matched in terms of category class equipment price range etc then sales figures are very relevant in determining a cars overall success and at close to 7000 units per month the tl is king \\nwow to dream to be like everybody else thats something special sales do not equate to quality simple as that if anything the high sales of an acura could be sign that the car is welcomed by the majority of americansyou know the obese stats speak for themselves lazy tend to prefer automatic trannies people who suck up all the natural resources of the world the same people who made the suv king popularity is a doubleedged sword ubiquity can certainly hurt a brand but then again we already know not many people even view acura as a luxury brand i agree 100 with your assessment my point was that underpowered medoicre and small are relative terms compared to most cars on the road the statements i made are basically correct it is only in a discussion such as this that a 18l engine could be considered small and the a4 18t slow i just thought id add a little perspective to point out that all of these cars are exceptional as for sales figures im still on the fence there i basically agree with you with the caveat that if two cars of similar class price and capabilities are released on the same date and are produced at the same rate and have the same advertising budget and company promoting them then i suppose if one outsells the other by 50 it is probably statistically significant other than that its just another nicetoknow figure its not good enough you like it to feel validated in your purchase you must have the approval of others  or at least some metric that shows x number like your car too did you buy the car to be one of many or to impress others or did you buy the car because you enjoyed it the more people post about sales numbers the more i sense this has little to do with personal feelings on the car otherwise why even mention sales numbers btw as ive stated before the tl is a likely replacement for my car so lay of the shtick that somehow youre one upping one of those evil bmw owners unlike many here i have no sworn allegiance to brand make or model i buy what makes me smile the most no matter what numbersstatspicture speaks for themself sales figures is a good measure for peoples jugement can you deny that fact why the car doesnt sell as strong as others improvement needed people can say whatever they like but those sales number is the fact 330is owner may not worry about this either the car will be the last model or it is a dying breed but the manufacturer will they will have to improve the car so they can keep up do you think those 7k ppl dont enjoy the car lol fortunately they are silent camryaccordburger has nothing to do with entrylevel luxury performance bcuz they are in different market segment price does prevent those accordcamry buyers from buying everybody prefer good handling good performance good features i am not saying tl has it all do you like a burger that has good handling features and performance fastest in 060010014mile  do you like a burger that has voice command and navigation do you like a burger that has leather or hard topmoonroof can you tell me what makes it popular what does sales figures represent no satisfying answer yet dont answer it with it just happen to be like that or the car just worth their dollars it worth the dollar becausefill in the blank i bet the answer would be from a different market segmentplanet and it will take a while  if the car manufacturer were satisfied with 400 buyers satisfaction then they would not improve danny  i agree that sales in and of themselves tell you nothing better to look at the budget vs actual in this segment there are fwdaedrwd cant look at the sales of the 3 seriesisg35cts rwd with many available body styles tops and engines to the tsxtl one body one engine one drivetrain fwd siblings better to know how much to capacity the plants are how many units the manufacturer planned on selling how many units the manufacturer can make kds you have a point there but it doesnt work with new product new product may have those limitations limited plantfactory limited dealershipservice station and also the need to survive but for sales purposes in that price range of sweet 3040k which manufacturer that doesnt have a plan to sell more it might work for limited edition cars very expensive cars where only a few people in this world can buy but for 3040k entrylevel luxo sedan the market is more than 28k are you saying that bmws plants dont have enough capacity to make or doesnt plan to sell the car or the manufacturer can only make 400 cars a month they mustve set the wrong pricing policy no matter what numbersstatspicture speaks for themself sales figures is a good measure for peoples jugement can you deny that fact why the car doesnt sell as strong as others improvement needed i do not believe that for one second not for an instant purchase patterns do not indicate buyers are getting the vehicle they feel is best gm sells millions more cars per year than anyone else by sheer numbers then your argument stands that the buyers snapping up gm products are then making some kind purchasing statement about gm quality if anything the buyers enter knowing their car is of lesser quality than more expensive counterparts do you think those 7k ppl dont enjoy the car lol fortunately they are silent i think they bought what fit what they wanted and value played a big role if the tl were priced the same as its competition im confident they wouldnt move 7k in a month camryaccordburger has nothing to do with entrylevel luxury performance bcuz they are in different market segment its all the same product product sales do not indicate that option is the nebulous best in a market only that some aspects of the that product appealled to more people great jack nonpermissible content removed the movie was the top film for a weekend and made buckets of money the quality is questionable the appeal undeniable price does prevent those accordcamry buyers from buying everybody prefer good handling good performance good features i am not saying tl has it all yes value plays a role theres a reason walmart is huge in the us the tl is a great value for features and abilites 33k for a car thats pretty much on par with say a 43k bmw thats a great deal does it mean its the best no only that people saw a 10k savings and perceived theres not much difference they jumped on a slammin deal do you like a burger that has good handling features and performance fastest in 060010014mile  product is product you may have different criteria for judging a car v your food but in the end you buy what fits that criteria 55 billion people can eat at a mickey ds good for them millions bought a gm last year great if we go exclusively by popularity then what happens to individuality and personal preference studios didnt used to release top money makers of each week they figured out that buyers are lemmings and being the top money maker and announcing it meant more people would be inclined to see the best film the next weekend ads for cars do the same things best selling midsize suv best selling korean car with a v6 etc for a reason i can never comprehend they pray on a concept if a majority prefers something it must be good to each his own do you like a burger that has voice command and navigation navis a rip off straight up 200300 in parts and software resold for a 1700 profit cars are made for profit but one item shouldnt generate that kinda dough people who buy gm would not consider 330i g35 tl entrylevel luxo perf sedan vice versa different market segment seriouly which car from gm product that fits into this category a product is a product if a car manufacturer thinks that way why bother producing different cars pricings ideas features or exclusiveness a car is a car a product is a product no matter how advance is technology who cares how boring this world is why bother specifying a specific segment like entry level luxury performance sedan wow generalization of different product and market segment out of this world i got to go later fedlawman we all compare cars differently cds recent sport sedan test 304 included cars like tl 325i is300 and g35 but not tsx automobiles huge test 1003 included cars like is300 and g35 as well as tsx wrx lancer evo mazda 6 s i certainly do think the tsx is a legitimate comparison with 325i is300 etc think we both like numbers using recent cd data for is300 3047 car comparison test and tsx 703full road test both with manual transmissions and tires that are 17 inch and 215mm wide msrp as tested 31 944 is300 vs 28990 tsx\\nweight 3380 lbs vs 3246 060 mph 73 secs vs 72\\n560 mph 78 secs vs 77\\n14 mile 157  90 mph vs

sedan vice versa different market segment seriouly which car from gm product that fits into this category cts a product is a product if a car manufacturer thinks that way be it mcdonalds spielberg j crew or acuratheyre still trying to do the same thing sell you something you really dont need they want to create a desire some do it through straight value mcdonalds in that segment others through brand name recognition j crew nike ralph lauren and still others through features and value  acura one price for everything your numbers are misleading as thats a tsx with the navi a tsx is normally 27k 4k difference of course one can get an is300 like that  31k msrp  for 28k before haggling agreed the tsx is definitely at a disadvantage in top gear acceleration tests due to its gearing you can really see this effect in the 270 hp tls top gear figures the reason why the tsx was excluded from the recent cd comparo is because it was a 35000 sedan comparo and the tsx is only 26500 i honestly think must admit some bias here the tsx would have scored higher than the tl because of its overall better balance and lack of handling vices i hadnt seen the automobile numbers but i think they look a little conservative theres always going to be some variation from test to test but ive owned several 8 second 060 cars over the years and the tsx isnt one of them fedlawman those who live by the numbers die by the numbers those are automobiles numbers i believe they were accurate same for cds numbers you have to keep in mind that each magazine has its own test methodologies cd rt mt etc do tell readers how they test eg if they use high rpm drop clutch and whether they adjust for atmospheric conditions for example cd adjusts rt doesnt cd acceleration test vehicle is loaded with driver full tank of fuel and 10 pounds of test instrumentation with manualtransmission cars wheelspin or clutch slip or both are used at the starting line to make best use of the engines power characteristics and the vehicles traction all upshiftss are liftthrottle with the clutch disengaged  various shift points are tried to maximize performance  all performance results are corrected to standard atmospheric conditions rt acceleration numbers are obtained using dropclutch starts and liftthrottle shifts discusses how they dont adjust for conditions and that a statisticallysignificant result in 060 mph 03 sec best way to aggregate the data is to average all published test results blueguydotcom those are the published astested msrps for the record tsx from 703 issue and is300 from 304 issue tsx base 26990 astested 28990 only option is nav system is300 base 29980 astested 31944 one option is lsd the is300 is an 04 fedlawman check out july 2003 issue of motor trend their comparison test of tsx vs c230 and 93 arc tsx had 6speed manual 060 mph 79 secs\\n0100 mph 208 secs\\n14 mile 160 secs  888 mph\\n600 mph braking 124 ft\\nslalom 623 mph leaves an average 81  79  723 773 secs the 72 appears to be the odd data point out i remember that mt comparo thats the one that quoted 060 in 83 seconds for the saab 93 arc and mb c230k right yeah i didnt like that one eitherlol fedlawman actually the tsx did win that 703 mt comparison test and even at 79 secs it actually had the quickest 060 mph time of these three cars dont get mad but as ive said before the tsxs small naturally aspirated 24l i4 just doesnt generate a ton of hp and what it does do it needs high rpms to do and generates way less torque esp useable torque down low has anyone ever seen a published test result for a tsx automatic wonder if it pushes 9 secs 060 mph actually car and driver and i see eye to eye on the tsxwe both love it i guess its no secret which magazine acura picked to spend advertising money on huh seriously though the general consensus is that the tsx 6speed is a lowtomid seven second car and the automatic adds about 12 second to that seems about right to me as for the small  lacking power comments i guess it depends on what youre comparing it too of course the 24l i4 has a displacement and power deficit compared to nissans 35 l vq motor what car in this segment doesnt besides the tl but compared to all the rest audi 30l bmw 25l lexus 30l saab 20l mb 18l jaguar 30l it appears that the tsxs 200 hp stacks up just fine the recent cd 35000 sedan comparo that you mentioned had the 325i as the 3rd fastest car behind the g35 and tl no surprise there consider how close the tsx and 325i are remember this torque chart rpm 325i tsx\\n2000 150 149\\n2500 160 156\\n3000 168 160\\n3500 176 162\\n4000 173 164\\n4500 169 166\\n5000 172 163\\n5500 167 162\\n6000 161 159\\n6500 142 155\\n7000  150 the tsxs little 4 cylinder motor is very close to the bmws i6 which explains why the tsx runs just a 110th or two behind the 325i in most acceleration tests which is also where the is300 ran in that cd comparo also notice that the honda i4 offers 90 of peak torque 166 from 2000 rpm all the way to 7000 rpmthats a 5000 rpmwide powerband to play with how many cars can make that claim so let me agree with you up to a point the tsx engine is small and underpowered compared to the g35 and tl compared to every other car in this segment its a force to be reckoned with you keep that tsx engine perculating and its torque is enough to make it pull confidently i prefered the freerevving liquid smooth 24 in the tsx to the tighter punchless 25 in the 325i oh the price certainly helped make the tsx more palatable too 26k yes it was offered to me at 26k before i even attempted to haggle v a stripped 325i that was still hovering over 30k with discounts fedlawman you wrote the general consensus is that the tsx 6speed is a lowtomid seven second car and the automatic adds about 12 second to that seems about right to me not sure what you mean by consensus is that what people want to believe the three published data points i found have a 773 average two results are close 81 and 79 with the cd 72 being the exception cds number is adjusted for conditions so we dont know what the actual track result was doesnt appear rt has tested a tsx yet anyone got data from autoweek has cr tested one seems like the published data would have tsx manual around 80 no idea about automatic but think it possible it might add up to 1 second ats tend to sap smallish low torque i4swhich would be in line with what at did with integra i dont the the a4 18t is slow at all for a 4 banger it is extremely quick comparing it to or an i6 or a v6 is unfair comparing it to or an i6 or a v6 is unfair why if you take a 18 liter four banger and apply only 745 psi of boost you will have an engine that should exactly equal the output of that same 18 mill with two more cylinders added sounds like a 27 liter i6 or v6 to me then again if im not mistaken audi has the waste gate on the 18t set much higher than 745 psi that should put it into the 3 liter range as far as output is concerned best regards\\nshipo i dont the the a4 18t is slow at all thats why they make different cars for all of us i owned a 18t it was a fun punchy little engine for a 4 banger it is extremely quick stop right there i dont rate things on a scale of for ainsert modifier it was good either its good or not in the realm of engines either it produces enough power to satisfy me or it doesnt on a scale of 110 id put the 18t at about a 6 still a failing grade dont worry my zhps engine would only rate about a 75 or so an 8 would be too generous comparing it to or an i6 or a v6 is unfair no its not im comparing it against all engines btw it competes in a class with 6s and if its any consulation after driving a 325i i knew i couldnt buy it partly because i felt power wise that would be a lateral move from my 18t why spend 30k to get the same power output with less useable torque too that i had on my 21k car i was talking about a stock 18t a chipped 18t is another story for 400 an apr stage i chip gives the a4 around 200hp but the car can easily be tuned to 250hp lets put it this way the 18t is faster than most i4s and it feels like a v6 so yes i do quantify my remark for a small i4 it has tremendous punch i think the hp figures on the 18t are underrated i have a mazda millenia with a 25l v6 and my a4 leaves the mazda in its dust not only that but as i mentioned above spend a few hundred dollars on a chip and even v6s can be had for lunch i was talking about a bone stock 18t that thing should be running something like 811 psi of boost which should give it at least the same output as any decent 25 liter normally aspirated engine currently on the market to take it to 200hp my ballpark guess that it would need maybe 1417 psi and to take it to 250hp would require boost of somewhere north of 20 psi like it or not it is absolutely fair to compare a blown 18 to a larger normally aspirated engine ranging from 25 to 30 liters best regards\\nshipo i wrote a review of my jetta every month and i consistently praised the 18t that said it didnt offer the punch i wanted from my fun car but yes its a fun darn engine like i said id choose it over a bmw inline 25 any day and twice on sunday of course id rather the 24 of the tsx over either of them until you chipwow 240 lbft of torque yummy after test driving almost all of the cars in the sport sedannear luxury class on several different occasions i have finally narrowed my choices to the lexus is 300 and the acura tsx as such i would appreciate any feedback or information board members may have regarding their experiences with either of these cars though washington dc winters are not normally that bad i am most concerned about the lexuss rwd thus any experiences with the is 300 in the ice andor snow would be helpful thanks in advance shipo so do you agree with blues statement that the 18t has no guts blue i was not wowed by the tsxs 24l i4 no doubt it is quick on launch but take it on the highway as i did and the engine feels strained the a4 18t wont win drag races but take that baby on the highway and it is right at home dont get me wrong i liked the tsx very much but to me it looked and felt too much like another accord the a4 18t wont win drag races but take that baby on the highway and it is right at home thats funny as were so different on the freeway i loathed the 18t as i found it loud and in the case of the jetta poorly geared with an a4 i also found the 18t to be too noisy its like a hornets nest on the freeway the tsx on the other hand had a nice long 6th that i could slip into and let the car glide along then again i prefer that i must go from 6th to 4th or 3rd when im on the freeway and i want power in my zhp in 6th im cruising and therefore i want it as quiet and loafing as possible the taller the gear the better 2500 rpm at 85 sounds perfect dont get me wrong i liked the tsx very much but to me it looked and felt too much like another accord im not a honda fan so i didnt see or feel anything accordish in my times with the tsx do i think that it has no guts talking about the 170 hp version hmmm i guess that depends on what its mounted in mounted in a light weight car say 2600 pounds i think it would be great however if it is mounted in a 3400 pound sedan then no i dont think it is up to the task best regards\\nshipo keep in mind the tsx uses a dragstriplike 4731 final drive that gives it the initial launch it also then has overdrive 5th and 6th gears to offset this final drive the 6th overdrive is very deep at 0661 the is300 uses 3731 final and 085 5th bmw has been using direct drive 5th 1001 in past e46 323i325i with various final drives under 3501 the new 6speeds bring overdrive my 98 540i6 had a 82 overdrive 6th with a 2821 final drive i think the 18t offers very spirited driving for frontrack models the combination of frontrack and 6 speed or cvt work well also i think the added weight of quattro and the tiptronic is a perfomace killer for the 18t if i wanted quattro i would have chosen the a4 30 yeah the tip and quattro suck the life out of the poor 18t i meet people in san diego with that combo and i wonder why theyd need the quattro here i take it you guys are talking about manual transmissions in the a4 18t and tsx because with an automatic they are slooower than i dont know what i couldnt believe how slow the a4 18t was on a recent test drive with the air running a foot to the floor wouldnt induce a kickdown i thought the car was malfunctioning if i get an a4 it will have to be the 30 model m thanks to everyone almost on this site ive learned more about their favourite cars and what they dislike about other carsi havent decided what car to buy but have narrowed it to a list that i would be more than happy to own keeping in mind that everyones priorities are different when choosing a car it would be interesting to know from all the regulars what would have been their second choice and why from my list below acura tl danny1878 great car but do i really need navidvdbluetooth\\nacura tsx fedlawman a better value than tl but does it have enough power\\ninfinity g35 chrisboth beautful car but interior upgrade for 05 coming\\nlexus is300 riez reliability king with flair but needs refreshing\\nsuburaru legacy gt 2005 saw it at the autoshowa new contender\\nvolvo s60 cant get this ford thing outta my head\\nhonda accordmazda 6snissan altima last resort safe family choices without putting one to sleep i havent chosen any german cars because reliability is a major issueplease dont be offended kdblueguyspeedracer as i love all your cars but cant afford to get a new car every 2 to 4 years which a4 18t combo did you drive my second choice right now would be a tossup between the 05 legacy gt and 05 s40 t5 6speed just as big on the inside as the s60 but handles far better but have not driven or sat in either one yet so this is all based on numbers reviews and pics so its pretty much a worthless opinion at this point the tl can be purchased without the navi now youre talking 32k or so great deal i love power and i think the 6 speed tsx wo navi is a screaming deal keep the engine over 4k and it pulls strongly you might wait for and 06 legacy gt nobody gets it all right the first model year some things are left off by design to drive demand for the next model year riez  by consensus i mean that i have read many many reviews of the tsx performed by many many sources and the range for 060 has been between 68 and 79 secs this combined with my own seat of the pants indicates a lowtomid seven rating ryanl1  personally i would choose the tsx over the tl because i value handling and overall balance more than straightline acceleration my 2nd choice would probably be g35 i love the 325i but i dont think the value is good unless you factory order and keep the options slim gotta have rwd irs and manual transmission want lsd and hid prefer i6 over v6 of course im most partial to is300 manual but my 2nd and 3rd choices would be  325i manual with sport pkg and hid\\n g35 manual with sport pkg but dont think i could ever buy the g35 sedan the coupe is just too beautiful hope the coupe is still around when i go shopping again in about 5 years then my kids will be gone and i can get the coupe convertible or roadster ive longed for in five years you may want the ford shelby cobra if a roadster is still on the list if not the hp wars will have the base coupes from lex infiniti and bmw at 400hp i imagine the g35 coupe will look like the gtr concepts out now but who knows thier success is breeding many new ideas im sure i find your comments about the g sedan strange while the coupe looks like a supercar you were looking for a sedan right i liked the fact that the coupe and sedan are so different but look similar enough i guess people love or hate the sedan and mostly love the coupe if i wasnt looking at coupes i would look at all sedans independently of the coupe sister the fact that they are different should be good  the 3 coupe and sedan are virtual twins i think the 4 series is the answer to that however there honestly isnt a poor choice in the bunch the only criteria is what one deems as the overriding featurescharacteristics that make one more desireable than another to the purchaser the new rumored g refreshing as well as the rumored slew of new product from bmw will make the next few years quite interesting while my car operates like a top i am not married to bmw having driven the epitome of the sports sedan i understand why the press and enthusiast people likes these cars but i like diversion in my car ownership experience can you say batter up for the g35 of course i dont know what i will do at this point in year and a half from now personally i would choose the tsx over the tl because i value handling and overall balance more than straightline acceleration fedlawman  youre not seriously suggesting that the tsx is more balanced and can outhandle the tl are you because if thats what youre suggesting you need to come clean with an explainationand it better be good lsd  bad handlingbalance gm does sell more trucks van suv buick cadillac chevrolet gmc hummer oldsmobile pontiac saturn saab etc against 1 car tl hmmm what else can i learn today o well you know i was hopelessly drawn to a black ultra sport package a4 18t automatic that the dealer had on the lot i was there looking at a 2003 a4 30 dark bluebeige wthe works but the look of those new a4s with the usp were just stunning so i let the guy talk me into driving one in short i loved everything about the car except the enginepickup i dont think there is a better looking car inside or out in this class than the a4 wusp however with the 18t engine and a automatic its all show and not much go the v6 is needed if you get an a4 with the automatic imo m thanks for everyones responseslurking on this site is like asking your doctorpharmacist what kind of side effects one may get gbrozeni cant remember what your first choice was at the auto show i observed a salesman showing a 60 year old couple smitten with the s40i waited till they left and then asked him what makes the s40 that much better than the mazda 3he didnt knowthere was a barrier around the car but he let me sit in itthe vertically arranged buttons on the center console is strange lookingif you convince yourself enough that the console is trying to make a statement then youll be ok\\nthe interior of the s40 is smaller than the s60the back seat is cramped for an adultit may not fit all baby car seatsits a beautiful car but basically too small for my needs the legacy gt 2005 was stunningas beautiful as g35tlit was on an elevated platform but i could see the interior was just as coolthe rep said they would be coming out in may and msrp around 30k usd but tba my first is the tl what makes the s40 better than the mazda3 how about more power better fit and finish more sound deadening material better seats better stereo higher quality interior materials more safety features etc etc wow you found a really bad salesman there actually that is what i have heard in most car forumsmagazines etc the tsx is better balanced probably having a lot to do with its smaller engine up front smaller body overall hey it made cd top ten cars i for one would miss the power too much to go with a tsx but it looks like a very tossable car by no means am i dissing the tl its a great car for me though the tsx is just more fun to drive like 95gt said its more tossable  playful sorry i just like it better yeah i know where youre coming from i once had an accord 4banger 5speed tsx is a fine car i was just being playful myself  sorry maybe i didnt ask properly did you drive the

system which not only distributes torque front to rear but also left to right i think it might be available on 05tl \\nhonda develops world146s first super handling allwheeldrive available this fall in the acura rl north america and the legend japan tokyo  april 1 2004  honda motor co ltd today announced the development of a new super handling allwheeldrive system called shawd that provides cornering performance that responds faithfully to driver input and outstanding vehicle stability a world146s first the shawd system combines frontrear torque distribution control with independently regulated torque distribution to the left and right rear wheels to freely distribute the optimum amount of torque to all four wheels in accordance with driving conditions the new system will be available this fall in the acura rl north america and the legend japan by monitoring driver input and driving conditions the shawd system determines the optimum frontrear and lateral leftright torque distribution this information is then conveyed to the rear differential where direct electromagnetic clutches continuously regulate and vary frontrear torque distribution between ratios of 3070 and 7030 and lateral torque distribution in the rear wheels between ratios of 1000 and 0100 torque is used not only for propulsion but for cornering as well resulting in a significant enhancement in vehicle maneuverability the shawd system is composed of sensors to detect steering angle lateral g and other vehicle information an ecu and the rear differential the direct electromagnetic clutches inside the rear differential another world146s first employ electromagnets to obtain precise control over the multiplate clutches builtin search coils monitor the gaps between the electromagnets and the magnetic body to achieve precise continuously variable torque regulation the rear differential is also equipped with a builtin acceleration device yet another world146s first during cornering the track of the outside rear wheel normally falls outside the average of the tracks of the front wheels the outside rear wheel does not rotate fast enough to keep up with the front wheels preventing efficient transmission of torque to counteract this problem the shawd acceleration device alters the gearing to speed up the outside rear wheel146s rotation relative to the front wheels this reduces torque transmission losses and significantly improves vehicle maneuverability at honda driving pleasure is regarded as one of the most important factors in vehicle development the new shawd system features 147feedforward148 control which utilizes the degree of driver input to determine appropriate torque distribution this results in a superneutral steering feel that responds with optimal faithfulness to the driver146s handling of the steering wheel realizing outstanding driving comfort and stability from official honda japan site\\nhttpwwwhondacojphdtvnews20044040401a youre right there is no accounting for taste obviously but it was nothing personal sorry you took it that way yes back in 1997 my car imo was the best looking sports coupeconvertible in its class dont get me wrong i like acuras but design wise they induce yawning imo m im not keen on the torquedividing junk as ive yet to drive an awd system that doesnt interfere with fun but i like the idea of the awd tl bmw audi infinitigame over with sales of the tl already exceeding 7000 units a month what car in this class could possibly compete with say an shawd 6speed tl packing 300 hp yeah i knowwont come with a 6speed honda game over your sales are going downward in 2004 while rivals toyota and nissan are going up nissan at an incredible pace show me the numbers besides i talking about cars in this class look them up yourselves in march toyota up 5 honda down 4 nissan up 30 honda was slightly down in jan slightly up in feb whole ytd its down nissan up 28  46 in janfeb whos afraid of tl not g which is up more than 20 for 2004 and its 2 year old going up against brand new tl not sure what relevancy sales data has toward which car is to be preferred or which car is best for you as there is none but you have to take into account factors that influence sales including advertising incentives lease deals etc as well as newness the tl is a brand new car in its first model year car like the e46 3 series came out in 1998 as a my1999 you have to wait for the newness to wear off and new competitors come out to see what happens to sales over the life cycle of the product many cars have had great introductory and initial year sales to fall in later years sometimes precipitously dont write them off yet infiniti bmw and audi are not standing still for one infiniti will bring the gtr shortly which will make the acura nsx look like overgrown bicycle i read these boards hoping to gain useful knowledge about the cars and to learn about peoples opinions based on their test drives their experiences and what theyve learned from going to dealerships and auto shows im not interested and i dont think many other people are either in some posters biases speculation or uneducated bankandforth chatter it isnt very helpful good point about sales ill just toss in fwiw that after two years the g35 sedan sales of 4247 were the highest ever only one previous month aug 03 over 4k where are you pulling your numbers from bmw audi infinitigame over with sales of the tl already exceeding 7000 units a month what car in this class could possibly compete with say an shawd 6speed tl packing 300 hp yeah i knowwont come with a 6speed if it doesnt have a manual whats the point of the car thats like a house without plumbing the numbers for nissan and mazda in a way are deceptive theyre just making up ground lost to toyota and honda in the 90s and they still have some way to go with the recent success of nissanmazda you can bet toyotahonda are going to pay much more attention to exterior designs from now on the euro is really hurting the euros in these incentive laden times the swedes dont use the euro do they maybe thats why volvo sales are increasing compared to the germans whos at vw going to stop the bleeding offers a lot of rebates on their product so that kind of explains why they are to able to move that much units honda on the other hand might just give you a 19 finance rate that is offerd once in a blue moon and they are still able to move a substantial amount of units what does that tell you about honda products honda vw nissan toyota and mazda arent the subject here and i dont want to hear that acuras are hondas and lexuses are toyotas so dont bother  just a quibble with the honda awd comments but audi already distributes power frontback leftright dave and so does xdriveatesa the point is honda is playing catchup in the market place xdrive is garbage though if it feels like the trash i endured for a weekend driving the x3 30 then id run from the tl awd yikes while you had it for a weekend i had it for a few hours and i liked it very much i liked it enough to buy it so i respectfully disagree with your opinion honda is playing catchup in the market place though this may be true they ultimately end up with the best products examples odyssey mdx nav system 32 vtec tl 6speed shawdtoo much to list it basically stepped in and interferred with my cornering constantly every corner i felt the xdrive system sapping entry speed and neutralizing the handling of the x3 30 i wasnt just fighting the lessthannimble handling of the x3 but also an overlyintrusive system that negates spirited driving in the name of safety though this may be true they ultimately end up with the best products i think you are talking about toyota who is still taking honda to the cleaners every year while nissan is slowly narrowing the margin for the 2 spot rebates i wish they had infiniti rebates kds did you buy an x3 no rebates at infiniti but if you want to buy a q45 theyd probably give it to you below invoice the i35s away the g is next in line not to mention the m45does anyone buy this car fx are going out the door waaay below invoice you are probably right about the i35s q45 and m45s but i think you are way off with g35s and fxs the latter ones are selling well last i heard the g and fx are super strong sellers the i35 is ancient and the q and m are dogs right now blueguy  you didnt flog the car on ice and snow i drove the thing fairly hard on pavement and didnt think it interfered one iota chris  im looking at the x3 as my next vehicle my post was misworded it should have said if the dealer and i would have reached an agreement it would have already been in my driveway acura is talking about introducing a revolutionary awd system which not only distributes torque front to rear but also left to right the jeep quadradrive awd setup does this as does the nonlocking version versatrak used on the pontiac aztek and buick rendezvous question i picked up the latest motor trend today for reading on the plane ride home from dc and read the cts tl 93 g35 comparo all of them were automatics and mt got the saab to go from 060 in 69 seconds when they did the c230 93 tsx comparo last july a 6speed manual saab did 060 in 83 seconds isnt 15 seconds a pretty large gap especially considering the latest has a slush box quadradrive is totally different it moves power from spinning wheel to the one with more traction almost any awd 4wd system can do it what acura build is totally different it measures actual g force and shift torque from one side to another in hard acceleration thay use cloches in rear differential im not an expert but i have not seen anything like it 69 seems realistic to me based on the weight torque etc the less poweful previous 93 turbo was about that fast twas a fun car once you learned to accept the turbo lag i dont think the 93 was outclassed during that test especially if you look at the otd prices on carsdirectcom with just a part of the money you save you can get this  httpwwwgenuinesaabcomtuning440htm 286ftlb yummy quadradrive is heavy duty 4wd system that will deliver 100 of torque to any one wheel it is meant for keeping the vehicle moving while towing a 5000lbs load all new awd systems vary the power front to back and left to right as measured by the electronics bmws system can operate with any two wheels spinning and will vary the output to any one wheel even going into a curve for certain new m45 is going to clean rls clock awd or not thatd be the same awd first used in minivan odyssey finally it makes its way to the top of acura sedan did you see my post showing acura was the only premium brand to lose market share in california between 20012003 even lincoln gained some now thats saying something btw infiniti gained the most share during that period i finally read the mt comparo the editors didnt have a fun time in that glorified accord did they especially when they had g for comparison while more powerful than g tl got beat in every performance category but im sure tl is pretty good for fwd on the car model sales figures i think danny posted them i noticed it said 330i and 325i do those figures include the awd models same for the g35x just curious also one other thing to consider in sales figures is the distribution channel within 30 miles i have 4 acura dealers 3 bmw dealers 2 mercedes dealers and 1 infiniti dealer also although the g35 rwd sedan is selling near invoice in my area the g35x and fx models are dealing on an msrp minus basis not an invoice plus basis discounts are less than those on the bmw or acura tl again probably a reflection of lower supply rather than higher demand for my area to me it seems that the infiniti dealer network size hasnt caught up with the popularity of the g and fx models including awd models bmw sold 6219 3 series sedans in march not bad for a model near the end of its run the infiniti g35 figure includes awd models i agree that part of why infiniti isnt selling even more vehicles is because their dealer network size is pretty small hopefully this situation will be rectified as infiniti keeps on making more hits you gotta remember that infiniti almost got pulled as a brand a few years ago and only the lowly i35 kept this from happening like old m45 cleared rl just so you know acura soled more rl in 2004 than infinity sold m45 and q45 combined and dont forget rl is 7 years old infiniti cant even sell g35 even old tl outsold the new g i think infiniti has a long way to go who cares about california acura had record month in march selling almost 18000 vehicles i bet infiniti did not even come close if it is that good y they couldnt sell more mind over matterp you draw ridiculous conclusions based on little or no facts and you are compromising your integrity in the process first the new shawd system is totally revolutionary and does not exist in any other vehicle it will render all other awd systems obsolete second you dont even know what the new rl looks likes so what basis do you conclude that the m45 will clean its clock third there is no other fwd performance car in the world that could compete with the tl  that is a fact but as car  driver stated if it was rwd it would win every comparo i respectfully suggest that you support your statements with facts or dont bother posting at all 1 to all i couldnt give a hoot who sells more or who sells less i buy cars cuz i like them i trust both acura and infiniti if either of them put out a great product ill but it not the hype besides who wants to drive a car that the whole world has some exclusivity appeals to me 2kahuna to say that an awd system that is not even out yet will render all others obsolete is like counting your lottery winnings before you play lets wait an see till its out an how it does 3 face reality kahuna tl is not rwd and it is losing every comparo to the g35 which is rwd btw in regards to fast fwd carsthe maxima is only 2 seconds slower motor trend than the tl and can be had for thousands less lets see what nissan has in store next let the hp wars continue 1 to all i couldnt give a hoot who sells more or who sells less i buy cars cuz i like them i trust both acura and infiniti if either of them put out a great product ill but it not the hype besides who wants to drive a car that the whole world has some exclusivity appeals to me preach on brother 2kahuna to say that an awd system that is not even out yet will render all others obsolete is like counting your lottery winnings before you play lets wait an see till its out an how it does still with ya do you really believe by spending 3040k you can get exclusivity sorry but maxima is a failure in nissan division and out of this comparo dont bother otherwise hp and microsoft would be in that comparo too i couldnt give a hoot who sells more or who sells less\\npeople dont really care what other people choose they buy what they think is better unless they are fools  tl is not rwd and it is losing every comparo to the g35 which is rwd\\nhave you read cr a magazine that doesnt accept contribution from any manufacturer and buy their own items for testing tl 1st take a look at cd comparo tl won on almost everything except rwd feelings i hope it can help its sales good luck danny yes i can spend 30k and have some exclusivity i drive an audi a4 and see a lot less of them than tl i see a tl every other block before the v6 altima came around the maxima used to outsell both v6 camrys and accords combined every single year of its existance thats far from failure although not in the comparo the current maxima will give the tl an run for its money you are right we buy what we think is betterbut what is better differs from one person to the next have you read cr a magazine that doesnt accept contribution from any manufacturer and buy their own items for testing tl 1st what is your metric it doesnt outhandle the rwders lexus es330 has a much nicer interior than the tl cr blew this one take a look at cd comparo tl won on almost everything except rwd feelings tl has only scored when doing a drop clutch start other than that its times are average i wont debate they give an allaround package for the money but it squarely is in the middle to end of the heap when you look across every single review and not single out one review where a clutch dump was performed everybody talks about how fast it is yet i know no one who would want to replicate the 57 second to 60 time before the v6 altima came around the maxima used to outsell both v6 camrys and accords combined every single year of its existance\\nthe best record of maximas sales so far i can get only is 15k units in march 2002 while accord 31k to 38k units yes the current maxima will give the tl a run for its money by dropping its sales 272 in march audi a4 sales for march is 3905 units\\naudi as a whole managed to sell 7469 units in march it is exclusive  kds tl \\ndoesnt performouthandle rwders\\nis not as luxurious as es330\\nis not cheaper than other car except bmw std ver no aspec\\nacura brand is not considered as a premium brand to some people and no car on this category can outsell it wow the greatest anomaly ever gtg  yeah but my dad can beat up your dad p yeah but macdonalds sells more than any other that must mean its the best what an anomaly apparently the refreshed 2005 g35 wont be shown at the ny auto show kind of a bummer who knows maybe they will though the altima with its nicely revised interior and 250 hp v6 makes a strong statement to just say no to the maxima like i said there is no other fwd performance car in the world that could compete with the tlperiod in fact the tl is the only fwd car that could give the top rwd cars in this category a run for their money the comparos prove it you are so concerned with sales why didnt you buy yourself a toyota camry or a ford f150they sell a lot more of those than tls it is obvious that you are not much of a car enthusiast all you can do is quote sales figures you trying very very hard to justify your purchase i am happy with what i drive i dont need to convince myself or the rest of the world that i made a good decisionand neither should you kahuna the comparos prove that the tl is continously getting trounced by rwd cars the previous tl got pounded by rwd cars also nothing has changed the previous tl got pounded by rwd cars also nothing has changed hyperbole will get you nowhere even staunch rwd supporters must admit that honda and acura has always given the rwd benchmarks a run for the their money in comparos the prelude tls integra rsx and tsx are all examples of fwd cars that handle virtually as well as their rwd couterparts and are repeatedly top finishers in magazine comparisons the tl may not be as quite as balanced as a 330i but it certainly is an amazing sport sedan that offers an enviable blend of performance styling quality luxury and value now if you value pure unfiltered rwd handling above all else its not the car for you but for everyone else its a tantalizing car the best record of maximas sales so far i can get only is 15k units in march 2002 while accord 31k to 38k units youre not very good at researcha simple visit to nissan news reveals that in 2001 nissan sold 102k maximas in north america in 2002 they moved 98k honda and toyota openly admit that v6 sales make up less than 20 of the total camcord sales the max unless this changed for 2003 still reigns as the midsize v6 import audi a4 sales for march is 3905 units\\naudi as a whole managed to sell 7469 units in march it is exclusive  im not sure why youre enamored with sales you really need that validation dont you bob bought one too gosh it must be a good car acura brand is not considered as a premium brand to some people acura is a tweener brand again even honda execs will admit theyre not viewed as a full blown luxury brand cars like the rsx make that impossible and no car on this category can outsell it wow the greatest anomaly ever people dont generally buy for the same reasons one mans quality is another mans cast off in southern california when you look at new home sales at least 90 are track homes  20004000 square foot bland poorly built ugly cookiecutter homes on flattened land with no trees so by your logic because most people when buying new get track homes then home buyers in general prefer planned communities 4 variations of homes designs and no individuality kb homes because they sell the most using your logic build the best homes  more people choose them they all cant be fools right its all about sales quality individuality are not a part of the equation again this discussion is not about nissans hondas or toyotas we have a full plate already with this topic  we dont need to keep dragging in vehicles that arent on the table if anyone needs to doublecheck what we are discussing here see pat mar 19 2004 534pm march 29th issue of forbes magazine you can see the link at the is300 board has an interesting article about the lexus is300 and lfc coupe prototype which has a v8 glad to see the is300 has an average buyers age of 30 the youngest for any toyota vehicleand that includes cars from scion the new subsidiary toyota created to attract the under30 customer unfortunately sales slid 33 from 2002 20306 units to 2003 13559 units mentions strong chance lexus will kill the is300 wagon sportcross forbes lists following 2003 sales data all bmw 3 series 111944\\nall mb cclass approximately 65600\\nis300 13559 only time will tell if lexus creates is300replacement coupe and convertible will be most interesting if they do kd in fast food category mcdonalds is the best and it sell more then any other brand for a reason same for near luxury acura sell more tls than any other manufacturer in its class and as you know tl is not that cheaper than competition you can argue as much as you want but tl is one of the best cars in the class speed as we all agreed many times before there much more to performance than 060 so dont even bother with maxima if you dont agree its you problem but when you take group of cars in the same category sales numbers will show which cars is better take g35 for example it handles a bit better than tl but overall its not even close same stands for camry i dont think has the best performance or looks but overall it is the best car in its class i think the g35 overall is very close to the tl i also think that the accord is the best car in its class although i have a sweet spot for the altima youre not very good at researcha simple visit to nissan news reveals that in 2001 nissan sold 102k maximas in north america in 2002 they moved 98k you are wrong blueguydotcom i said 15k unit in march 2002that was the highest record but not for the whole year and for accord 3138k units was its monthly sales anyway 105kyear is less than 9kmonths while accord 3138kmonth next time when you need food just buy maximabmw not burger again you guys are trying to compare different item diff segment diff creature i am talking about entrylevelluxuperf sedan not burger not truck f150 not camryfamily sedannot autohomes not toilet not software not watches etc sorry boss i didnt know that i cant quote sales figure 060 0100 14 mile lsd voice command dvda 600 etc i have tried so hard to find something bad about the car but so far only rwd feelings thats not even allowed in this discussion here is this called car enthusiasts discussion lol do i need validation with 7k people buying evry month lol\\ntl is the only fwd that can compete with 330i g35 rwder jrock i also prefer altima new camry over accord and g35 coupe i am trying to like the new accord bcuz i will need a replacement for my accord in a year or two its been fun indeed you are wrong blueguydotcom i said 15k unit in march 2002that was the highest record but not for the whole year and for accord 3138k units was its monthly sales anyway 105kyear is less than 9kmonths while accord 3138kmonth honda sold 31k v6 accords in a month check your stats as thats just not possible in fact if you broke it down it was probably more like 6k v6 accords maximum again you guys are trying to compare different item diff segment diff creature i am talking about entrylevelluxuperf sedan not burger not truck f150 not camryfamily sedannot autohomes not toilet not software not watches etc its all the same my house just like my bmw my computer and the salmon in the fridge is just a product sorry boss i didnt know that i cant quote sales figure 060 0100 14 mile lsd voice command dvda 600 etc i have tried so hard to find something bad about the car but so far only rwd feelings thats not even allowed in this discussion here is this called car enthusiasts discussion lol quote all you want it seems people are desperate for others to approve of their purchase its not good enough that you like the car it seems important that 7k people this month did too this is akin to people who cite box office as proof a movie is good 18 billion in box office doesnt mean a films good by default and 7k sales in a month doesnt either the accord sold 30k cars last month ill flat out say it the accord is not a good car so 30k people made a bad decision maybe not for them but i found it bulky wallowy and just not a fun experience on a scale of 110 the accord would rank about 3 or 4 for me tl is the only fwd that can compete with 330i g35 rwder true so what do sales have to do with that i like the tl i do not like the stigma that goes with bmw buyers and im not digging the vibe im getting from some tl buyers in here too this reminds me of the attitude when the g35 arrived kd i bet you remember those posts and many g35 owners were not content to love their cars  they wanted the world to nod and say you got a great deal on a bmw beater time has passed and now the g35s just another legit option unlike previous infinitis you dont see that attitude as much with the g but boy has it come on strong with the tl so for you you got a great deal the tl is a wonderful car love it for what it does for you how do others feel about it does it matter unless theyre buying you the car what anyone else thinks of your purchase should not be relevant being the best selling car in any class is a useless stat when it comes to making your buying decision you dont automatically buy the bestselling of other products do you so why would it matter with a stupid toy danny sorry for being a little too personal by mentioning audi sales i like its stying and comfort  you can quote sales all you want i love my a4 and i dont care if they sell 2 or 200k audis as a matter of fact the whole vwaudi division is in the toilet right now so i lease my car when the lease is over if i like another audi ill get it or if not ill get something else more on the tl the recent motor trend comparo commented that steering was overboosted torque steer was evident brakes were worse in the group and the turning circle is huge equivalent to dodge ram truck doesnt say sport sedan to mejust a guzzied up honda accord with a big engine i fully agree if you classify the tl as an average family car and classify the 330i as an average family car the tl would probably win as a vehicle more people would want to drive but if that concept is extended you get back to ford taurus as the preeminent family car i can see how cr could think the tl has more utility than a 330i but now if one is talking near luxury sports sedans fwd fall short the recent rt review seems to echo some of the sentiment of torque steer yes the tl may have more utility than a 330i but it is not a better sports sedan thats why cr got it wrong it doesnt matter how many tls are sold each one of them comes with a little bit of torquesteer yes ill have my sports sedan torquesteer to go blueguy\\x85 cant figure out how you hate fwd yet like the tl tends to be confusing but is indicative of what the tl has going for itself curious how theres no mention of drive type for the fwd cars on the acura website the only places where drive type is documented are with nsxrwd and mdx4wd seems to be tacit admission of the growing sentiment against it and that reports of acura migration to awd is most believable and to be expected the new tl seems to be real popular and is becoming ubiquitous but fwd is getting incredibly negative pr\\x85 must present a major headache for the manufacturers who have years of equity in it heres a bit of this negative pr httpslatemsncomid2081194 i am not sure that the link provided convinces me that fwd is getting a lot of negative pr\\nmickey knaus  whoever he is  isnt someone who i am willing to accept as having a lot of influence in the marketplace or anywhere for that matter that conclusion became apparent when i saw his source for most of what he is stating as his opinion was a gm suspension expert\\ngm experts on suspension  the expert must have based his dissertation on those terrific suspensions on buicks\\npeople here keep dissing the sales figures the sales figures are much more of realistic indicator of the buying publics acceptance or rejection of fwd automobiles the tl is out selling all of the rwd cars that pat allows us to discuss on this board as entry level luxury performance sedans i dont believe the majority of car buyers care as much about fwd versus rwd as the very small number of participants on this board do\\ni know the people here who believe they are different because they dont buy cars lots of other people do will take exception taking exception is certainly their right but it doesnt alter the fact that acura continues to manufacture and sell a lot of really fine fwd cars in a class dominated by rwd cars the reason is they give a lot of value for the money and that seems to be more important to people than what kind of drivetrain the car has\\npat has sent me to the penalty box lately so i have to be a kinder gentler commentator it s against my nature this reminds me of the attitude when the g35 arrived kd i bet you remember those posts and many g35 owners were not content to love their cars  they wanted the world to nod and say you got a great deal on a bmw beater or the attitude of bmw owners that the 3 was still the better car they wanted the world to say the 3 is still the king of its class tl owners point to sales and accolades i remember 3 owners doing exactly the same thing the tl is out selling all of the rwd cars that pat allows us to discuss on this board as entry level luxury performance sedans there is nothing inherently wrong with fwd sales only has to do with popularity not best of breed even cr says the tl is basically a torted up sic accord jrock  nobody is not saying the tl is not a good car it offers good value for the money you can point to the accolades fair enough as long as you point to criticsms one of the big ones is torquesteer now we can debate endlessly on whether that matters to an individual but the question is how acceptable is it in the nearentry level sports sedan segment the g35 debate was different in that it got down to the precision handling of a 330 vs the more family oriented value of the g35 with less precision and finesse and again those types of differences are open to a wide range of different opinions in a public forum such as edmunds but it depends on your priority in an automobile kd dont kid yourself 330 is not a sport sedan either sales figures basically show how many people prefer one car over another in case of near luxury g35 330tl and so on tl is a best seller and so more people than not think its the best in the class that is why they buy it now we all have different opinion but at the end the majority wins blue what difference does it make v6 or not honda sells more accords than altima and maxima combined so whats your point plus altima is total garbage even compared with basic accord strong v6 does not make car much better espacialy in family sedan category there were many many many different g35 vs 3 debates i was just referring to the fact that just as many g35 owners looked for approval from the world so did many 3 owners in defending the 3 its interesting that you mention that one must point out criticisms of the tl i dont remember you criticizing the 3 a single time for anything correct me if im wrong how acceptable is torque steer in the entry level performance car segment it depends on how you define a entry level performance car to me it is definitely one of the biggest weaknesses of the tl in the light of being considered a performance sedan hows the x3 purchase going did you get it yet the fwdisbadtorquesteerprovesitcamp have yet to answer the so what question ill accept the torque steer to nodrive during periods of inclement weather in good weather just give it a little more right rudder and go  and it does go in other words i want yearround versatile performance fwd is aces when the weather goes in the can and the tl makes it easy to get a high performance highly versatile luxury platform if torque steer is the trade off im all for it to me the advantages of fwd far outweigh the negative perception of torque steer you know i too bought the fwdbetter in snow argument back in the late 1970s for many years there was no one who could convince me otherwise then in 1999 i bought a 328i and found that with the standard issue allseason tires it was nearly as good as my 1995 passat in slippery conditions since then i have both moved to new hampshire where we had 114 of snow last winter and upgraded to a 530i which i equipped with winter tires simply put the 530i when shod with my winter wheeltire set is the finest winter driving vehicle i have ever had the pleasure to push through inclement conditions the fact is that the rwd cars discussed in this topic with a good set of winter tires mounted will run rings around a similar fwd car running summer tires or even allseasons for that matter for my money that is what truly constitutes versatile performance as for torque steer i am really glad that i dont have to put up with that anymore oh how i hated torque steer best regards\\nshipo kd dont kid yourself 330 is not a sport sedan either correct it is an entry level luxury sports sedan i dont remember you criticizing the 3 a single time for anything correct me if im wrong i have criticisms of the 3series none related to handling though could be bigger could offer more horsepower for the same money could have better cupholders could offer more features included in the price etc could have a better allaround reliability rating from the companies that measure such things if torque steer is the trade off im all for it to me the advantages of fwd far outweigh the negative perception of torque steer to each their own with regard to the importance of attributes of automobiles i have criticisms of the 3series none related to handling though could be bigger could offer more horsepower for the same money could have better cupholders could offer more features included in the price etc could have a better allaround reliability rating from the companies that measure such things fair enough fully agree if you classify the tl as an average family car and classify the 330i as an average family car the tl would probably win as a vehicle more people would want to drive but if that concept is extended you get back to ford taurus as the preeminent family car if you can extend such concept why limit them to a family car category only why not all car  trucks and ship all kind of transportation category next one will be burger toilet paper v6 i never said its only v6 maxima vs accord  if youre not comparing v6 to v6 sales then youre using a dubious metric the max is offered as the top end of the midsize range from nissan the 4 banger accord is specifically designed to appeal to a different buyer do you not grasp that the vast majority of buyers dont give a hoot about handling power or performance  thus the reason cars like the es330 accord and fordsgms sell well do you think all those 7k people had their decision from sales figures the truth i think price honda reputation and standard equipment drive the majority of tl sales and always have a comparable equipment wise 330i would run well over 5k more to most buyers imho the lack of rwd would mean nothing to them as they buy appliances when i help friendsfamily buy cars and theyre looking to drop 3040k the general statements are i need something reliable something pretty luxurious its got to have a little power so ill take them out and if they drive a 33k version of a g35 tl a4 and 325i theyll walk away most impressed by the pricepowerequipment of the g tl only one person still wanted the 325 over the past two yearshe fell in love with the handling but he drives cars hard g was number 2 for him fwiw designman\\nblueguy\\x85 cant figure out how you hate fwd yet like the tl tends to be confusing but is indicative of what the tl has going for itself i recognize the excellent value look at all you get for that scary low price if id gone tl which was not out last year in may id have saved a big chunk of change and had a car that would offer probably 90 of what i got minus of couse the more useless visual and tactile cues i prefer on the 3 series if money or equipment had been the primary determining factor in my purchase i would have gotten the tsx remember no tl then in the end i fell for the roar of the motor the the pull of the 6 solid turnin and the bonejarring ride of my zhp careful i drove a 325 and 528 all over central ma and nh for many years we both know that the weather there chooses the time and place it wants to make a mess and that may not be in synchronous harmony with when or where we finally have the opportunity to switch out the tires for the conditions at the end of the day it is physically impossible to fish tail a fwd car unless it is going in reverse up hill moreover with a good set of all season tires and fwd theres nothing to do if it snows 3 feet one week and happens to be 70 the next the fact is that the rwd cars discussed in this topic with a good set of winter tires mounted will run rings around a similar fwd car running summer tires or even allseasons for that matter for my money that is what truly constitutes versatile performance nice try with the apples and oranges comparison the fact is my tl with winter tires can run circles around your 530i any day of a winter week the fact is my tl with winter tires can run circles around your 530i any day of a winter week okay ill take you up on it having recently been in a rwd mercedes with winter tires in the snow i can say it ruled would have definitely outhandled any fwd car even with snows for me and the kind of driving that i do there is no replacement for rwd unless there is a properly balance meaning power and weight awd solution available regarding when the weather does its worst i have opted for the michelin arcticalpin tires and while they are no match for the summer set that i have they are easily the dry road handling equal of a typical set of allseason tires as such i dont need to replace them until mid to late april regarding the new tl a design by the way that is what 8 years newer than my 530i yes i have no doubt that it will out accelerate my 530i in snowy conditions however given its front end bias id bet that the 530i will stop shorter and probably handle better nope i find it highly unlikely that it would run rings around the 530i best regards\\nshipo blue if money or equipment had been the primary determining factor in my purchase i would have gotten the tsx remember no tl then the tl was still around it was blowing trannys remember the tl was still around it was blowing trannys remember speed lol that tl didnt exist on my shopping list it didnt even have a manual without a manual i couldnt consider it i have criticisms of the 3series none related to handling though could be bigger could offer more horsepower for the same money could have better cupholders could offer more features included in the price etc could have a better allaround reliability rating from the companies that measure such things no kidding any 330 well equipped comes out to about 45k msrp before tax and license the 325 also well equipped come out well over 35k these cars are the size of subcompacts a local bmw dealer was running a special of 127 for an oil change i thought oil changes were included for 4 years that must be why bmws 99 or older only cost 99 i have removed some of the most blatant offtopic messages that have been posted since my last request that we stick to the subject if you folks want this discussion to continue lets keep it on track okay and lets lose the hostility theres no need for it no kidding any 330 well equipped comes out to about 45k msrp that is an statement that perhaps needs to be modified to a 330i equipped with every available option is 45k i never buy any vehicle with every available option with the exception of buying japanese cars without the choice of options no person i know of buys a car with every available option even those that opt for the extremely highend cars now we all recognize there is a different value scale between japanese and german vehicles these cars are the size of subcompacts having sat in the back of a tl and g i can honestly say i was underwhelmed by feeling of lack of space in the back seat so yes the 3series is slightly smaller but at least it doesnt look like it should have a big back seat the back seat in the tl and g are bigger but it is not as roomy overall as one would think given the relative sizes of these cars to the 3series i still felt very cramped back there is that what you think it takes to out maneuver a tl in snow  an overpriced overweight underpowered rwd mercedes with winter tires lol not that driving in snow matters for this category but i think you wrong one guy from work was not able to take his s500 up the slope in snow not big angle just long he left his car at the office and went home with other coworker driving rlfwd oh yes he had winter tires on the car s500 i wonder how folks survived in the olden days when almost all cars were rwd and nobody had traction control or snow tires but this discussion leaves me a bit confused except for price i see no reason why the subcompact 3series bmw or audi a4 could be compared at all with the midsize saab 95 or acura tl as a 6footer i feel downright claustrophobic in either of the german offerings yes i understand that handling may be marginally better in the smaller cars but the same is true of a gokart the more apt comparison would be 5series bmw or audi a6 both of which are seriously overpriced i felt that the back seat room between the tlg and the 3 was substantial the next 3 supposedly addresses this issue hopefully it will do so without any compromise in handling the more apt comparison would be 5series bmw or audi a6 both of which are seriously overpriced amen to that brother i wonder how folks survived in the olden days when almost all cars were rwd and nobody had traction control or snow tires in the olden days the cars weighed 5000 lbs is that what you think it takes to out maneuver a tl in snow  an overpriced overweight underpowered rwd mercedes with winter tires lol  correct an overpriced s500 however i believe that comment applies to the 3 or g as well ive been driving in new england winters for almost 30 years and have never owned a fwd car i know its hard for some people to believe but it really is possible a good set of snow tires and learning how your car handles can go a long way and this is not a knock on fwd but simply to point out that at one time there was no fwd and people got thru winters just fine hm that hits a bit close to home and probably accounts for a lot of the difference of opinion i sit really vertically and i dont fit right in a lot of cars the old tl was included in this category of cars that are downright uncomfortable for me the rsx and integra would have sent me for weekly chiropractor visits a friend with a honda accord coupe giggles when he takes me for rides becuase i look so uncomfortable but the 3series sedan is fine for me while the coupe is not best car i ever sat in for me was my old 900 though lots of space above the noggin even with sunroof installed the new 93 is not quite as square inside which is too bad but it still has lots of space around the head that would have been the best car ever if it had been in the shop  a lot  less so unless the tl has a lot more headroom than the old one it might be the cramped overpriced one for menot that anyone else might care dont get me started on seats designed for people with narrow shoulders bad posture and big butts ugh i dont get how issues such as midsize and compact are decided the g35 is described as a compact but its got more interior cubic footage than the tl and the front is larger and having sat in the back of the g35 its not exactly tiny dave what basis do you have for saying m will clean out rls clock 1 g cleaning out tls clock altima cleaning out accords clock while were on subject 2 rl has the same illustrous heritage odysseypilotaccord can anyone venture why tl does so badly in 1000 braking it came pretty close to 93 and cts in 60mph braking but in 100 mph it takes 2030 feet longer than those two and 50 ft longer than stupendous g35 mt says thats equivalent to lengths of five devilles look on the\\nbright side during that lengthy distance and time you can get through most of the lords prayer dont care about ca its only the largest wealthiest hippest state in the union its one state no company can afford to do badly in you guys never fail to provide some of the best reading on all of edmunds such witty writing m not that driving in snow matters for this category but i think you wrong it depends one of my neighboors has a 4x4 pickup with appropriate tires and a steep driveway his pickup was at the bottom of the driveway a few times this winter a lot of the fwd cars spun and spun before they made it up some of the more inclined driveways in the neighborhood two winters ago an accord was trying to get onto the main street up a hill out of the development the accord just couldnt make it up finally backed down the hill and went around another way i made it up the hill albiet with a little help from dsc the accord was not much older than my car and the tires looked okay to me while i generally believe a fwd with allseasons will do better in the snow than a rwd with allseasons the sweeping generalization that fwd is better in the snow than rwd is just not true it has been my experience that it comes down to skill more than anything else that and common sense avoid snow drifts hills etc when you can if youre in a rwd car but this doesnt mean fwd cars are invincible either especilly in the hands of person that thinks a fwd car can go anywhere i too have seen all types of vehicles rwd fwd awd get stuck usually due to people trying to execute silly manuvers in deep snow like they dont have to make any type of adjustment to their driving style due to the type of car theyre driving m the new tl does have much more room for the driver than the old i couldnt fit in the old one either unless i tilted the seat so far back that i could barely reach the steering wheel but i just fit in the new one perfectly well maybe about another quarter inch of seat travel would at least give me the choice of more than one seating position but its fine as is can anyone venture why tl does so badly in 1000 braking it came pretty close to 93 and cts in 60mph braking but in 100 mph it takes 2030 feet longer than those two and 50 ft longer than stupendous g35 weight distribution tl  61 front 39 rear\\ncts  5446\\n93  5347  i was surprised too \\ng35  5248 pretty much what youd expect really with 61 already in front it would be more like 80 during hard braking and the rotors are probably aleady hot hauling the car down from 60 very plausible but just to be sure id like to check braking and weight distribution of accord maxima and altima if thats the problem why did honda make such a front heavy car honda used to mean meticulous engineering merc thanks for the compliment but tl fans dont see the humor anywhere i can tell you that but im ready for their onslaught that is an statement that perhaps needs to be modified to a 330i equipped with every available option is 45k i never buy any vehicle with every available option with the exception of buying japanese cars without the choice of options no person i know of buys a car with every available option even those that opt for the extremely highend cars now we all recognize there is a different value scale between japanese and german vehicles i came to the 45k estimate based on the web site of bmw of mountain view from autonation linked from edmunds most of their 330 inventory was 43 or 44k a lot of it was coupes but still if you add things like the premium package nav system leather xenons 17 wheels and the sport package which increases hp to 235 you get to about 45k that is about 10k more than a tl nav isnt it i dont think honda set out to make a noseheavy car i think it probably would have cost a few thousand extra to engineer in weight distribution and they felt  quite possibly correctly  that most people would be more enticed to buy based on lower sticker price or more features than shifting weight around on a car like the nsx or the s2000 where performance is paramount they do distribute the weight heck a lot of sporty car owners never drive aggressively i made an lexus salesman nearly wet his pants with how i test drove the is300 and i didnt think i was doing anything special dave is 5050 dist at least thats what they were saying in 2003 is the new engine heavier i got the info from a few official sources such as\\nhttpwwwcapitalpontiacgmcanadacomenglishvehiclescadillac  ctscts_detailshtml i bet the 32l is 5050 and the 36l is a bit heavier not by an amount anyone should lose any sleep over dave the reason for the nose heavy bias seems kind of obvious to me a powerful v6 and a beefy transaxle all packaged in the nose of the car wheres the mystery that the only other fwd car in the above list had nearly the balance typical of rwd cars seems to be the result of the much smaller physical size of the mill and greater attention to detail i too am pleasantly surprised at the frontrear balance of the 93 best regards\\nshipo i wonder how folks survived in the olden days when almost all cars were rwd and nobody had traction control or snow tires actually in the olden days of rwd and biasply tires almost everyone did have snow tires it wasnt until radial tires and fwd became common that people started assuming that they could get through a winter without snow tires at least in michigan i had studded snow tires on my 69 gto or i would have been pretty helpless in a typical winter around here my 3l was about 40k msrp with the these options now i recognize the price went up but not by thousands 1 premium\\n2 step\\n3 hk upgrade\\n4 cold weather package\\n5 i might have missed one or two thats everything i want in a car anyway nav to me is the biggest waste of money i am researching a garmin no sport either the roads around here have craters as big as the moon you add things like the premium package nav system leather xenons 17 wheels and the sport package which increases hp to 235 you get to about 45k um the performance package increases horsepower to 235 and you get 18 inch rims with it my perf zhp with leather and xenons  no navi as thats the most useless thing since the fanny pack  had a sticker of 43k i paid a few hundred below 40k for it folks also put chains on their tires dont see that anymore either my tl is fitted with brembos acura tl\\n600 mph 115 feet braking performance is topnotch too with 60to0 stops averaging a short neat 115 feet our drivers were very impressed with our 6speeds alldisc abs brakes with brembo front calipers results are comparable to some recent porsches weve tested  motorweek thats rightporsches me thinks that 600 is a little easier on the brakes than 1000  best regards\\nshipo ive done that a few times like i saidno worries  take one article out of one magazine and that justifies the tls brakes being more than adequate i dont think so\\n \\nyou can not use sales volume to justify the tl being a great car i read in an earlier post about mcdonalds being at the top of the fast food chain they are along with many of franchises why not because of product it is all branding why has madonna done so well for such a long time is she the best singer you ever heard no of course not it is all branding you need a good car not the best of the bunch to be a big hit and that is what the tl is how well you market that automobile will take care of the rest the tl is not the second coming of christ as some people hear lead us to believe theres a reason to buy one i think these are the types of comnments that inadvertantly give some people confindence in thier purchase where there should be none the g35 standard package brakes are seemingly the best on any sports sedan short of an m why almost every tester not just one raved about the stopping power and 1 even mentioned that just one italian supercar came to the same stopping distance as the g sedan when one says they are porsche worthy but the rest say soso or not so greatthats why they all have to be taken with a grain thats why i want to see data on the other fwds with big v6 throw in avaloncamry too i want to see if its a honda thing or a big fwd thing none of the cars mentioned on this board are the second coming many on this board just cant face the fact that tl offers the biggest and best bang for the buck in this categoryend of story i guess it depends upon your perspective for my tastes fwd cars need not apply in fact awd cars are only considered after being given a seriously hairy eyeball in my book and remember i am a staunch bmw supporter the best bang for the buck on the market these days is the g35 best regards\\nshipo many on this board just cant face the fact that tl offers the biggest and best bang for the buck in this categoryend of story but for many people the best buy for the buck isnt the best option some want the best for the limit they set i didnt care that bmw was over 40k only that it satisfied 80 of my desire for a price i found acceptable the tl if it had been out would have hit about 7577 the price difference wasnt enough to make me look to the tl if the 330i had come in at 50k and i hadnt swung the deal i got maybe the tl would win out price wasnt the final determining factor though sorry if i cared about bang for the buck in 03 i would gone for an sti and just obliterated pretty much all non supercars in my path which is exactly why i chose the tl over bmw 3 and g35 the 3 fell short on interior room and value for the money and i couldnt live with the poorly contrived g interior the tl on the other hand far exceeded my requirements as for rwd performance who but a few of you really care i drive in the real world with pot holes speed limits and traffic congestion not racetrack fantasy land the socalled benefits of rwd were just not worth the compromises i would of had to make with the any of the other cars mentioned above from the days when i drove fwd cars there was a daily occurrence of something i really love not having to deal with anymore torque steer p best regards\\nshipo from the days when i drove rwd cars there was a daily occurrence of something i really love not having to deal with anymore fishtailing on snow covered roads o wintery condition is common torque steer dont care about ca its only the largest wealthiest hippest state in the union its one state no company can afford to do badly in  i guess you not from ca than to much anger in your posts we can argue which car is better as much as we want but the fact is that sales make the car a success or disaster tl is doing much better for acura than g35 for infiniti and accord is doing much better for honda than altima for nissan with that said i think rl will do better than m45 not that it makes big difference but tl 6mt has weight distribution of 5941 which is not that far from other rwd competition you add things like the premium package nav system leather xenons 17 wheels and the sport package which increases hp to 235 you get to about 45k um the performance package increases horsepower to 235 and you get 18 inch rims with it my perf zhp with leather and xenons  no navi as thats the most useless thing since the fanny pack  had a sticker of 43k i paid a few hundred below 40k for it what is the perf zhp the name of the options package anyways i based the price on the msrp and noticed that the edmunds own tmv prices werent that far off the msrp only a few hundred of course everyone is going to try to shave more than a few hundred off the msrp the problem with that is someone can always make you feel bad eg some guy with a bonnevile gxp or something hmmm the only time ive done that in the last 25 years it was on purpose we live at the end of a culdesac and had a very nice snow covering of six inches or so so i switch off the dsc and nailed it i had the kids in back and they had a ball watching all of the snow slinging out the back with the car driving sideways around the circle i made four or five circuits before we got bored and went in for dinner  prior to that ive only spun out unintentionally twice once in a rwd 1970 dodge challenger with bald rear tires hmmm i wonder why they were bald  in wet conditions no less and the other was in my 1979 scirocco on dry pavement oh my isnt the scirocco a fwd car yup even so i entered an onramp a little too hot and managed to accidentally perform a complete 540 before coming to a stop facing back up the ramp oops like it or not with modern traction control it is virtually impossible to get the back end to hang out even on purpose unless you switch off the electronics i got my drivers license thirty years ago and i have extensive experience driving awd fwd and rwd cars in horrible conditions on roads all over the world and fwiw i feel much safer driving fast in slippery conditions in a car where the front wheels arent at the mercy of engine power as to whether or not they have any grip different strokes for different folks best regards\\nshipo 060 in 68 sec with a 46l v8 give me a break this car deserves no place on this board i assure you could we stick to the cars we are supposed to be talking about and stop pulling all these other vehicles into this discussion and could we also stop with the sniping at each other this discussion is getting too unwieldy  probably was to begin with  but as i mentioned just a little bit ago those of you who would like to see it continue need to work harder on those two things what will the neighbors think o pat i see what you mean  sorry tastes kahunah are you saying that because i dont value a car in exactly the same way you do that im wrong we all know that you think that the tl is the absolute high water mark of entrylevel luxury performance sedans however i respectfully disagree to be sure honda had done a masterful job at taming the fwd demon that said if im going to lay out my hard earned money the car had better be rwd or an extremely well engineered and balanced awd system the key point here is that i dont give a rats tail what other folks think i should drive i drive what suits me period best regards\\nshipo its fairly rural where we live and only one neighbor saw me he came over later that night and asked for a ride  best regards\\nshipo so should we use the fact that the 32l tl placed behind the 25l bmw in a recent comparison test to exclude it tl does 060 in 57 sec according to cd thats all that matters does anyone know the frontrear brake diameters on the tl is it 2 pot front and 1 pot rear its disappointing for such a nice sports sedan to have such mediocre brakes although i like the tl i think the aero 93 with the ppc by bsr chip would be awesome lots of parts for the 93 already httpengstromnet\\nhttpwwwabbottracingcom2003indexhtm but that doesnt matter a bit in the real nonracetrack world what is the perf zhp the name of the options package the performance package is called a zhp among bimmer fans anyways i based the price on the msrp and noticed that the edmunds own tmv prices werent that far off the msrp only a few hundred edmunds little toy is useless as it allows you to mix and match things that cant exist together of course everyone is going to try to shave more than a few hundred off the msrp i shaved close to 4k off mine i would not put to much trust in the stats you should judge from your own experience i know for a fact that previous tl had a weak brakes  how i know i owe one when i bough it non of the reviews had it as a concern i also had a 93 legend and brakes were grate we can argue as much as we want but to know for sure we need to put cars together on the track and see which does what braking system \\ndualdiagonal powerassisted 4wheel disc brakes with abs front discs \\nautomatic transmission ventilated 114 in 300 mm diameter 11 in 28 mm rotor thickness manual transmission  brembo ventilated 122 in 310 mm diameter 098 in 25 mm rotor thickness rear discs \\nsolid 111 in 282 mm diameter 035 in 9 mm rotor thickness  hondanewscom also the brembos have 4piston calipers others just 2 sales also depend on how a company prices its cars in other words company a might sell 10000 cars with a 800 profit per car while company b might sell 5000 cars with a 2000 profit per car would you say that company as car is more successful in this case nissan north america has the highest profit margin of any major car company so far this year even beating out perennial leader bmw so i dont think theyre really worried about how the g and the altima are doing which are doing fine btw actually i bet that the next m outsells the next rl just a hunch im looking forward to the m45hopefully infiniti will get this one dead on in a weird way i sorta dig the current one we shell wait and see i dont think current m and q are that bad but its got to be a reason that infiniti cant sell it you also right about profit margin it is highest in north america you forgetting one thing though nissan also spend less then any other manufacturer on the vehicle result is big profit margin i guess it will do for 20k altima or even 30k g35 but when you start using cheap materials for cars like m and q you got a problem even loaded accord interior is better than any infiniti unless infiniti spend big bucks on the interior for new m my money is on rl my money is definitely on the rl httpautonetcaautoshowsstoriescfmstoryid11574 if 060 doesnt matter a bit in the real nonracetrack world how about tailout sensation  what kind of 25l bmw stats with the success of the new tl my money is also on the rl stumbled over this from the mailbox today httpwwwmsnbcmsncomid4655254 interesting sales stats too im looking forward to the m45hopefully infiniti will get this one dead on in a weird way i sorta dig the current one haha i kinda dig the current one too in a weird way maybe its because i only see one once in a blue moon you forgetting one thing though nissan also spend less then any other manufacturer on the vehicle result is big profit margin nissan spends its money on enginedrivetrain toyota spends its money on nice interiors and honda does a combo of both although it doesnt lead in either with the success of the new tl my money is also on the rl well well have a better idea in a few days with the upcoming gs m rl and a6 to go along with the 5 and the e were gonna need a second board lest we get booted by the moderator for talking about them that segment is really going to heat up will this second board simply be named luxury performance sedans actually forgive me for being hasty or presumptuous but i just added a discussion named luxury performance sedans under the 5 series rl and m45 boards i asked the moderator to add it to the eclass a6 and gs boards as well doubt that there will be many posts in there for the time being since the new m gs rl and a6 wont be out for a while acura will either add the 100 hp elctric motor rumored on autoweek or go bigger than the proposed 300 hp v6 btw people talking smack about infiniti interiorshave they been in the fx its a fine interior but what do i know i love my bimmer interiorsomethings are more important than soft leather seats if you are trying to get us all to say that the tl is the best car in this class you are dilusional please quit while you are ahead we are happy that you love your car so muchthing is we all love our respective cars also rumor sources tell the spies that well finally see the e350 at the latest midway in the 2005 model year look for the car to out perform the current g35 sedan i found this in autospies i dont know if its autospies who want to spice it up or mb is really setting up g35 as performance bar to beat good luck mb but it wont be easy as acura found out what did acura find out that their bank account is overflowing with record sales of the tl i guess you meant to say what infiniti found out they sell alot of taruases toodoes that mean they are better infiniti has set the benchmark  no fwd sedan can seriously be the benchmark my money is definitely on the rl what a surprise i hear you blast the g35 interior but neglect to mention that the tl interior looks like a clone of the honda accord even though i have a g35 coupe i can admit the interior needs some work it is called being impartial you should try it some timewait a minutei forgot the tl is flawless  lets write about the flaws of our own car thats part of the discussion no fair unless you write 34 or

choice\\noutside the building i work in are parked a new 350z a new m5 lots of 3 series in every flavor\\nmy tl new 35 maxima and others all nice cars and some i know for sure i would be very happy with  as in m5 or 350z \\ni wish we could see honest discussion here about some things that arent what we thought they would be or need improving on the cars we bought most of the critic isms are aimed at cars we dont own ill go firstwhat the hell was acura thinking when they designed the steering wheel location relative to the instrument panel  you cant see the speedometer when the wheel is adjusted to where you want it maybe it is different for others depending on their driving position but neither my wife or i can see the speedometer with the wheel where we want it\\nthat doesnt detract from my driving enjoyment enough to outweigh the things i do like however\\ni am going to drive three hours each way to play golf on friday and one of the reasons is because i like driving my tl and i get the best of two worldsa nice course and a nice drive i am positive i would have an equally good time in g35 or a 330i or certainly in that m5\\ni bought a tl because it suited me in the areas i considered importantprice styling and also it was car my wife also enjoys driving i am sure the others here did the same\\ni just object to having it jammed down my throat that i should have purchased a different car because   fill in the blanks  ok my g has some issues with a rattle in the rear somewhere and its a little fast sometimes other than that i wish it had audi interior and looked industrial still great posts this could be a very productive conversation so what are you saying about the last 93 pages of this thread what did acura find out that their bank account is overflowing with record sales of the tl i guess you meant to say what infiniti found out  es is the other top seller in the segment obviously most buyers in the segment arent looking for performance or else theyd be looking at g or 3 exclusively the good news is that the issues that ive had with my last two cars are really nothing more than nits so to speak no show stoppers  issues with the 2002

it on this site lets just say its definitely better than the current g and ms interior i am still sitting on the fence but 325i is winning i can get a 325i prepaid 36 month for 23000 vs 29500 tlthe bmw list approx 43500 these nbrs represent all taxes included and nothing down\\n325i it does not have all the options tl has but then again i do not want all the options tl offers and charges for dang im not big on the exterior but i like the power and thats a nice looking interior in pictures im bored lets go back to fighting and subliminal slams at this rate we will soon have people quoting car reviews where martha stewart is raving about interior colors and the matching thingies on the dash  it really comes down to what your needs are aside from the personal design preferences if 184hp rwd and a few options is all you need the 325i is a fine choice but to my way of thinking i got everything i needed including a bigger car 270hp 6speed brembos and all the other features youre familiar with for a lower list price cdn41800 if you go prepaid whats the buyout after 36 months a few months back my comparo shopping started with the bmw 330i sedan with the all the options i wanted it didnt take long for the price to reach and exceed cdn50000 then the tl came along and for about cdn10000 less my needs were greatly satisfied i know youre on the fence but have you considered adding the infiniti g35 into the mix i like the m45s exterior except the taillights seem to dominate the rear a bit too much the rest of the car id describe as smooth and sleek i prefer it to the 2006 gss bulbous styling although the gs isnt a bad looking car either the interior is definitely better than what infiniti has been offering so far although wed have to wait to see the production model in person to judge the quality of materials no need to tame the exterior design for the assembly line because its quite impressive as is interior has a nice fresh look to it but still dont care for the

experienced far more efficient than nissan and toyotas engines for luxury lines oh and 209 for premium is cheap im paying that for regular premium is around 230 a gallon here and my 4 banger protege

to another autmotive forum but a review or any other relevant material is fine some things that riez didnt mention 1 you cant select or hold 1st gear with the eshift automatic gear box if you launch from a stop with something less than 23rd throttle it will short shift to 2nd to save fuel 2 the front dash side vents have chrome stripes on the louver directional levers that reflect in the door glass about eye level with the side mirrors the solution is to black them out with a marker pen 3 you cant deactivate the skid control i found vsc to be a little intrusive during a trip to the local race track on a wet day 4 the traction control is way to sensitive fortunately you can turn it off so you can take full advantage of the limited slip 5 shock valving on the eshift car is a little too soft when you approach the handling limits of the car 6 the paint chips far too easily a clear bra is your friend in this case 7 i have the sportcross version and it doesnt have an internal rear hatch release button or lever the hatch is manually open from the outside when all the doors are unlocked 2005 rl httphondanewscomcatid3046mid2004040738738mimeascamp amp archivest conservative but pleasing styling outside good job on the interior as well 35 v6 w 300 hp and awd nice power lots of toys but styling is not distinctive the tl looks better rl  big accord btwi feel the same way about the new m45 looks like mix between a q45 g35 altima and maxima not as dramatic as the prototype sketches or even the tl but very nice styling for the targeted demographic although you really cant tell from the photos it looks smaller than i expected itll be interesting to see how the new shawd system shakes out in upcoming road tests 03 g35coupe 1 when passenger seat built cover is left in an upright position it rattles against side of the car 2 engine sound gives more of a whining noise than a roar like my previous clk430 3 cd takes too long to change cds 4 brake dust is excessive 5 no memory seats 6 bose system lacks quality in the mids and highs area with all the hype of a6mrlgssts i think its safe to say none is a homer the italian design boutiques dont have to feel threatened ill pick 5 over any of these at least its interesting thanks is your coupe auto or manaul and which options did you choose agreed on the appearance ive seen the new a6 in person and its really bland the 5 is the only one that stands out as different and sporty im getting bangled the rl reminds me a bit too much of a super sized es330 i think its the huge headlamps i want to drive a 6 speed tl with that shawd system and 300 hp that could be fun dear forum i never thought this would happen to me when i was a teen i loved the look of the mustang stocker from the late 60s i used to draw updated versions of it  smooth bits offsetting the rough edges larger wheels etc fast forward 15 years and fords making that car i dig the look and power of the mustang gtr minus the spoiler of course  yuck i need to go home and drive my bimmer to cleanse my soul of ever entertaining notions of a 500 hp mustang although derivative id rather take the m45 it has a nice interior and sounds like it is a barn stormer blue are you going schizo on usi thought you hated american cars with a passion anytime the car is an auto with premium package sports package and metallic paint ivory pearl with black interior i like the white exterior with the dark interior i also think the black on silver inside looks good the only other options that were available were the rear spoiler and the overpriced navigation system rl technology and its innovations are astounding not too fond of its exterior the front side reminds me of an esaccord while the butt looks like an oversized accord for exterior i prefer the tl or the previous 5 series m45 nice interior but exterior also reminds me of g35 sedan i think rl has better technology and innovations but 35l engine with 300hp only give me a break are you going schizo on usi thought you hated american cars with a passion rules were made to be broken i like the mad max look man this goes back to my teen years  its like the way my ears perk up when i hear theme songs from horrible 70s and 80s sitcoms essentially its primal id even go all black for a car like that  and i swore never to own another black car gunmetal rims nice weekend carlol now that i think about it a dark dark gunmetal gray would be pretty wicked im sure itll be cheaper than the m5 i was drooling over last week that was based purely on the engine some more m45 photos httpwwwnissannewscomhttpwwwnissannewscomnissannewsproductsreljanel2002072105400shtml click on m45 concept then click on photo library the more i look at it the more i like it the two speakers mounted on the shoulders of each front seat is interesting that really brings the sound close to the ear i guess theyll tone down the output of those speakers relative to the body mounted speakers 35l engine with 300hp only yeah that is disappointing especially with awd makes it tough to compete with a 340hp v8 its good output  sort of then again we know bmw gets 350 out of a 32 liter 6  m3 csl im also kind of disappointed that the car only comes with a 5 speed auto bmw and mercedes are using 6 and 7 speed automatics in most of their cars these days jeff its the topic police again reporting for duty hey its what they pay me for ya know  why dont we take the conversation about the m45 the a6 and the rl to the discussion jrock started for that class of vehicle here luxury performance sedans that one is specifically linked to those three discussion lists so thats where you want to post your comments if you want them to be seen by the majority of our visitors and members who are interested in those vehicles if anyone has forgotten our topic vehicles in this discussion are listed here pat mar 19 2004 634pm 335i 340i 345i does anyone have any info on the next generation bmw 3 series engines as far as displacement hp etc and will they show up in the next generation 3 series the g35 and acura tl has made it very interesting by out horsepoweringout torqueing the 3 dont forget its only a concept tl concept also had 300hp not 270 so hp can go up or down before this car hits show room in any case i think 300hp is good enof to compete with 6 cylinders versions of is competition one of the reasons m45 did so poorly is luck of v6 most of gs e and 5 are being sold with 6 cylinders in fact 80 of gs is i6 i dont think acura wants to spend money on something they cant sell if the come up with full size sedan maybe they will build v8 this way theyll be able to use the engine for two vehicles and maybe full size suv in any case exterior does not look exiting at all to bland interior is very nice bmw will introduce new 35l engine for 535 i think new 3 will have current 30 standard and 35 as an option and will they show up in the next generation 3 series the g35 and acura tl has made it very interesting by out horsepoweringout torqueing the 3 funny how those numbers still dont translate to more powerful automobiles ill take my 30 liter 235 hp zhp over the supposedly more powerful 270 hp 32 of the tl and the 260 hp 35 liter vq in the g if bmw goes to even a 32 l we know they can pull out over 300 hp and as weve seen those german horses tend to be bigger than japanese ones ill take my 30 liter 235 hp zhp over the supposedly more powerful 270 hp 32 of the tl and the 260 hp 35 liter vq in the g  lot more people think otherwise supposedly there was supposed to be a 30l twin turbo i6 in the works but that seems to have gone quietso perhaps it was dropped the twin turboing was supposed to be sequential tooso a smaller turbo for quick spoolup and a big one for boost at high rpms was supposed to be 385hp or some such dave funny how those numbers still dont translate to more powerful automobiles ill take my 30 liter 235 hp zhp over the supposedly more powerful 270 hp 32 of the tl and the 260 hp 35 liter vq in the g isnt that because the 3series body is lighter than the tl or g bodies lot more people think otherwise lets have another conversation about purchase numbers thatll be really productive lets dont and say we did eh  its lots more interesting to talk about what we like and dislike than what the abstract numbers say seems to me i actually would buy a 3 series over any tl g35 etc id even buy a 325i auto i think that bmw just proves that they engineer one or some of the best cars you can buy i mean an m3 with a 32l i think with 333 hp and  torque and lets not forget the performance pkg on the 330 only increased 10 hp and is still underpowered compared to g35 tl and it all around out performs a g35 and tl i would love to see bmw continue their engines wo turbosuper chargers they seem to do so much with naturally aspirated smaller displaced engines on all of their cars compared to their rivals isnt lexus dropping a v8 in the is 300 and what about the rs4 from audi bmw should bring back the m3 sedan in a hurry to put these other car makers back in their place just for the record i do not own any of these cars ive had a 2004 mitsu galant gts for 3 months less hp than accord v6 and altima 35 but the gts kills em with the 250 tourqe and sport tuned suspension the residual is just under 24 ks\\nthe point i am making that you can get the bmw listed around 47 to 49 ks and still pay less net than the tl \\ni was very surprised tooi think bmw is trying in a big way to grab the market share and the deals are there driving both cars i must admit there is no contestin my opinion there is no front wheel car that comes close to bmws handling\\nnot to mention the all paid service for 3 yrs60000 kmwarranty 4 yrs80000 km road assistance and choice of tires \\ni made the deal with bmw after driving hondasacuras since 1975  i hope you got 330 with performance package because 325 doesnt come close dont kid yourself i know g35 do outrun 330i i dont own g35 also lighter or not 060 stats proves it dont kid yourself i know g35 do outrun 330i i dont own g35 also 060 in 56 when did the g35 sedan do that havent seen that stat from any mag the less powerful 330i performance package with its smaller 30 liter inline 6 pulls to 60 in 5956 seconds depending whose numbers you believe  bmw says 59 and they always go conservative youd think with another halfliter in displacement the supposedly more powerful g35 would be quicker or what about the tls 270 hp v6 gearing horses whatever it is bmw does more with less than the others what happens when bmw puts a 32l in a 3 series oh then were talking about 060 romps in the 4s and over 330 hp suddenly the 35 liter vq doesnt seem all that impressive who ever asked about horsepower wars do they even realize that bmws 1998 car design still bests these latecomers that bmw currently makes a 32 liter engine that will obliterate the vq and tl congrats and enjoy the ride looks like bmw is really

to each his own im not looking for bang for the buck  or id own an sti but i do find it hilarious that people are saying the g35tl is hot on the 3 series when both are 2 years old or less while the bimmer debuted in 98 as a 99  6 model years ago thats like taking on lennox lewis at the end of his career and beating your chest over it it took infiniti until 2002 to come up with a bmw challenger acura 2003 even now you know that bmws 32 means at any second they can slip it and the m moniker into a sedan and itll eat tls and gs for lunch what exactly are honda and nissan doing with their big engines and engineering obviously not much if the best they can do is go toetotoe with the guy who is on his last legs shouldnt they be roundly beating him now have a good night guys and before i leave i dig and respect both the tl and g35 i just find the hp snorting comical given the results and the 3 series is great handling vehicle but for my money the car is too small and too pricey for what you get gs and tls are much better value good night indeed jrock65  id rather have the car cost less to each his own im not looking for bang for the buck  or id own an sti but i do find it hilarious that people are saying the g35tl is hot on the 3 series when both are 2 years old or less while the bimmer debuted in 98 as a 99  6 model years ago thats like taking on lennox lewis at the

guy who is on his last legs shouldnt they be roundly beating him now well for 18000 more id hope it could eat gs and tls for lunch i have no doubt that honda and nissan have the engineering to produce much more hp and performance from their current engines its all a matter of cost to them its not cost effective to do so at this time to bmw it is you make it sound as if bmw has been just sitting around since the intro of the current 3 in my1999 theyve been upgrading the car especially from an engine standpoint when it first came out it was a 28l engine then bmw upgraded to a 30l your zhp and its engine modifications were introduced only last year who cares if bmw uses a 28 30 32 or 35 bottom line is performancefeaturescost but i do find it hilarious that people are saying the g35tl is hot on the 3 series when both are 2 years old or less while the bimmer debuted in 98 as a 99 i find nothing hilarious about it so when the new 3 comes out in my2006 can we no longer compare it to the g and the tl just my thoughts nothing personal intended not to mention we are talking about historically family and economically oriented japanese companies producing vehicles that can compete with the historically performanceoriented endallbeall german moniker for far less money so explain to me again how this makes bmw look good when one goes to europe one realizes that bmw is just as family and economically oriented as are the japanese marques the only real difference is that bmw leaned toward the performance and handling niche whereas the japanese leaned toward the simplicity and reliability niche historically speaking to put this in context i was doing a project for mbusa in the mid 1990s and the folks from stuttgart liked what i did for the folks in montvale and shipped me over there for a while due to the fact that i was a contractor their insurance regulations prohibited me from being assigned a car from the pool reserved for the mbusa folks so they rented me a small bmw said rental had four doors a 16 or a 18 liter mill i think it was the 16 crank windows no ac cloth seats and a simple radio without a cassette to make matters worse i was driving north out of austria early one morning about 400 am and the 316i was laboring up a long hill south of ulm flat out at something like 80 mph when i saw a pair of headlights catching me fast no sooner had i finished passing a string of even slower moving cars and moved over to my right a chrysler minivan passed me doing well over a buck twenty so much for the endallbeall image of bmw best regards\\nshipo when i was in düesseldorf germany in 1998 on business all of the taxi cabs were bare bones and i mean bare bones mb 190es complete with cloth seats and crank windows they were painted in an awful green and orange color combo the interior was very plain and mostly covered in cheap brown vinyl ugh when i got home after the three week trip my 92 accord felt sooo luxurious in comparison gearing horses whatever it is bmw does more with less than the others what happens when bmw puts a 32l in a 3 series oh then were talking about 060 romps in the 4s and over 330 hp suddenly the 35 liter vq doesnt seem all that impressive  no one can say the bimmer engineers arent good at refining a sedan and engineering the heck out of it over time but in its first try nissan bested the true class competitor 330i and is redefining the expectations of this segment its truly a joy to own a g and hear people compare the car to much more powerful or expensive machines such as m3 and any 5 series as the car seems to find it self compared to so often the m3 is over 50k and is not much bigger than a civic while very beautiful and classic in design its very pricey for the propeller on the hood and the extra oophm worth it  maybe if you can swing it maybe last year and not next year tho its another whole class the m3 sits in with a 911 carerra and the vette that we are comparing a 27k car tovery cool to me now as for the vq being tame  yes its not pushing all the m hpliter but thats a 17000 motor with a 1 failure rate from such a long stroke working at 9k rpm nice but quirky and expensive the vq can easily perform 300hp without any major tweaks and could possibly get to 340 or so if tuner like the m guys tune the vq maybe still not the same high hplitre as m3 but much cheaper much more reliable and still more productive than 99 of the v6s sold in the us ill take it for 1k you can take the existing 260 in the sedan and turn it into 290 or so thats an 11 increase with minor work and dollars this engine screams to do more and the short stroke and balanced v6 are not as smooth as a straight 6 inherintly but find another v that even comes closeand costs so little to make blue i am very impressed with the vq the fact that it can propel a midsize sedan in the mid 5 range is very impressive the bmw 3 is fast but it is also the size of a sentra my lease expires this year 01 audi a6 42 and i have started test drives thus far\\ns4 m3 330i zhp c32 tl mt  auto g35 coupe 6mt m45 s60r e500 just out of curiosity i agree with recent posts regarding to each his own and for me i need a sedan

hope it is a good one\\ni am still pissed off at acura for not willing to dealthey still do not believe that i dumped them  sorrynot 330 but 325power does not mean that much to me as long as the power is adequate enough torque and great handling\\ntimeless design and tracks as driving on railroad tracks i mean a regular 330 is not running no 56 this is the performance package equipped version and perhaps a juiced one that cd got at that 330 perf package costs way more than what you can get into a g35 for if you tuned your vq yourself spending the money you saved youd end up ahead bmw doesnt have any voodoo hp tricks that others lack its a question of money the specific output of the 325 is very low just look at a 9800 duratec 25 pumping 200hp that was 6 years ago mind you i also notice that none of the tl lovers here are touching the motor trend comparison about the torque steer they basically wrote sure you could live with it but why would you want to not an exact quote i dont have the mag here in front of me to sum it up\\nthe g35 dominated since there was no bmw competition but the cts keeps creeping up in these comparisons coming in second this time it pulled a 66 with an auto which will probably mean a 62 when the m6 hits lots this june as an 05 so i could drive a 5 series in size and comfort that goes 62 for as little as 32k or i could force my friends to cram into the back of a 3 series and either spend a little more money for equal performance regular 330 or spend way more for slightly better performance 330 perf package no thanks im not into paying more for less just to have what everyone else thinks is cool i work hard for my money and the status symbol factor of bmw does nothing for me for me a person who needs to use the back seat at times but still wants a balanced sports sedan the g35cts are clearly the value leaders brian but in its first try nissan bested the true class competitor 330i and is redefining the expectations of this segment first try nissans had the i class for a long time and it was in the same market segment entry level lux the g comes a good 10 years into nissans first failed attempts its truly a joy to own a g and hear people compare the car to much more powerful or expensive machines such as m3 and any 5 series as the car seems to find it self compared to so often who would compare a g to an m3 there is no comparison thats beyond silly comparos to the 530 make sense the 545 no way the m3 is over 50k starts at 45k and is not much bigger than a civic\\nwhat regardless i find the 330i to be too big  thats why im looking forward to the m2 in 20067 worth it  maybe if you can swing it maybe last year and not next year tho its another whole class the m3 sits in with a 911 carerra and the vette that we are comparing a 27k car tovery cool to me youre the only one doing that quite frankly the gs a fun car but its not in the same league as the m3 911 or vette  those are flat out performance cars when youre running sub 5 second 60s then itll be called a gtr the vq can easily perform 300hp without any major tweaks and could possibly get to 340 or so if tuner like the m guys tune the vq again so its also much larger weve seen over 350 out of the 32 on the m3 csl for 1k you can take the existing 260 in the sedan and turn it into 290 or so stock for stock i dont care what mods are out there kids are on the road with civics pushing over 400 hp doesnt change the fact its still a civic the gs a fine car but its not nissans first foray into entrylevellux and its certainly not in the league of cars like the m3 911 or vette sti evo to believe it is can only be described as foolishness why would i buy a 330i base it was a fun car but if bmw makes a better one why wouldnt one go for it i desperately wanted an m3 sedan to be frank if bmw sold it itd be sitting in my garage at this moment but if ifs and nuts were candy and nuts regardless this all began because someone babbled about the g35 and tl outgunning the 3 series i dont see it that way i see that they finally caught up with it  while posting high hp numbers and still they arent winning comparos straight up its only when adding price that they win some of the comparoand to some buyers price wasnt the determining issue when buying a car for fun afterall its a toy if im tossing 33k on a car 6k more is not that big of a deal in the scheme of things if 6k means 10 more happiness the trade off is a no brainer in my opinion i think in the end im buying my sports sedan for a different reason fun roominess bang for the buck modability dont enter my equation while the cts may have decent acceleration its the rest of the package that turns me off it looks like a piccaso characature of what im not sure the interior is a serious turn off to me and dont get me started on the handling which felt to me less stable and precise than our family caravans much less than either of my bmws personally i think that the g and the 330i with just the regular sp not the zhp are well matched the g has a little more room and depending on the day may be a little faster the 330i has a higher quality interior and depending upon the day is a better handler i will not speculate on the e46 replacement but i wouldnt bet against the bmw engineers on that one best regards\\nshipo i rode in one the other day it had the performance packageoption and stickered around 44k ride is firm but tolerable had the 36 liter engine which seemed atheletic enough nice sized interior and trunk way too much plastic inside with some cost cutting parts evident here and there id like to try the ctsv in the near future but i suspect a test drive will be hard to obtain and i still cannot decide how i feel about the exterior design although it is beginning to grow on me i think btw the 2003 e500 i drove is quite nice and probably can be had for a relative bargain its been over a year since i drove a cts and i dont remember if the performance package was included on the one that i drove or for that matter if that package even existed late in 2002 regardless the car was much too soft and unstable when pushed for my tastes maybe i should give it another chance on second thought maybe ill wait until the next generation when hopefully the look is not so objectionable best regards\\nshipo hey just becasue im tickled that everyone points to the m3 when hpltre of the g is mentioned doesnt mean i think they compare i never said nor dillusionally consider the g to be in carerra territory 27k baby and im not the one bringing m3 and 5 series up in this thread but it seems they enter the equation when one wants to liken the vq to something less than the supposedly exclusive world of overpriced bmw tuning still good but pricey blueguy  i forget that the g20 called itslelf a bimmer beater  i forget it actually exists the good old days of reaming the american consumer with simple marketing to undereducated buyers is coming to a close i made all those mistakes myself infiniti learned that the hard way and ps stock for stock i think the numbers are right on for the g and zhp in everything infinti never had sport sedans nor did they ever compete in the arena infinitis were just more luxurious versions of their nissan siblings g20  sentra\\ni30  maxima\\nqx  pathfinder\\nm30 coupe  probably a cousin to the 300zx240sx the q stood alone as having no nissan relation infiniti got it right on the first shot with the g35that a huge accomplishment as their first foray into true sport sedan segments just wanted to add my 02i took the cts for the 24 hour test drive it had the luxury package not sport in comparison i had driven the 2003 with the 32 engine there is a major difference in performance i previously owned a 98 3 series and can honestly say that the handling performance of the cts is on par with the bimmer in everyday driving that is on the track it maybe a different story but for real world driving the caddy performed well above my expectations especially when you add in the fact it is a larger vehicle regardless the cts was much too soft and unstable when pushed for my tastes that was my experience with a fully loaded manual model when it came out i was shocked at how poorly the car handled after all the bogus raves in magazines which reminds me autoweek carconnection carpoint all carried stories about how detroit was overtaking euro cars for reliability the tone of the writing suggested for some weird reason the writers were excited and the excitement should be felt elsewhere thats sort of the reason i take reviews of american products with a grain of salt its almost like the reviewers are trying hard to like the vehicles overpriced in your eyes  which is all that matters when buying  to me the price was right a g35 manual at 27k with the features i required leather moon xenons still wouldnt be acceptable to my wallet because my heart wouldnt have been satisfied ive spent the first 28 years of my life being sensible with car purchases  id always take the better deal over the vehicle that really stirred my soul once i began looking in that over 25k bracket i decided i wouldnt settle for a car that didnt get me excited the moment i saw it were all hardwired differently my priorities were fun manual 4 doors over  price wasnt going to determine the purchase never again if i can help it i love cars too much to settle i agree with sawyerjon on the performance of the cts with the new 36 liter engine i traded in a navy blue 99 corvette for my luxury sport package equipped cts so i know how a true sports car is supposed to handle while the cts obviously doesnt have the horsepower that the corvette does it handles extremely wellwith tight responsive steering and brisk throttle response the engine has a nice refined purrr to it too\\n  before ordering the cts i spent a month driving every other competitor i could think of from bmw mercedes lexus infinity even a lincoln ls the only one i didnt consider was hondaacura i had a really bad ownership experience with a honda some years agoand cant bring myself to buy another\\n   for what i am looking for in a car at this point in my life the cts fit the bill better then anything else it has room and comfort very satisfying handling and acceleration the luxury feel that i think i deserve and bold styling that sets it apart from the crowd and turns heads on the road scott ps i dont have the stripper either so i know what you mean as far as engine prowess youd need to get the m3 to really have anything over on the g regardless of displacement as we i believe agree the zhp and the g sedan stocker is dead even for almost any category at upper highway speeds the g may have a chance to outshine a tad and really price is an issue or wed all be in maserati or lambo price is not an issue for a certain bracket or segment but you are still locked into that segment i got to save 7 k from the 40k zhp and i can hang with it so i dont feel i compromised within my classand zhp is really a class higher imo between m and 330 so the handling on the cts has improved what about the interior and even more so the exterior i just couldnt bring a face like that into my garage best regards\\nshipo cts interior got some mild updates a little more wood a little more classy lighting of instruments full rework for 2006 model exterior has had minor updates as well trunk lid dropping that ugly grey and gaining a body color license bezel better wheels better onstar antenna style and positioning ultimately you have to like the styling of the car youre buying if youre a car guy if you dont no use trying to force it dropping an extra 6000 is an easy decision for you more power to you you eluded to a perf package 330 being 39k by saying if you were spending 33 what was a 6k more i just priced out a 330 perf pack with just enough options so that it would equal a g35 or cts in fairly basic form msrp came to 45k\\nso that 330 with perf pack is at the very least 10k more than a g35 or cts putting price aside the 3 series sedan simply isnt big enough for a trip of any length to have adults in the back seat unless theyre all of shorter statue if youre very well off and dont need to carry more than two people around for any serious amount of time and the bmw speaks to your soul enjoy i think the rest of us g35tlctsls93 will find wonderful ways to spend our 10k brian im bigger than most so i find the 3 too small in the front as well  not bad but after a while its not quite as nice as the 5 sized gand still less dough dropping an extra 6000 is an easy decision for you more power to you when it comes to happiness yes in the scheme of things if i keep the car for 3 years and paid it off thatd be 2k a year im not going to be unhappy for 2k a year as im leasing it for less than a comparable timemileage lease of a 30k g35 im really paying maybe 200300 extra a year is your auto bliss worth 50 a month 2 a day mine is you eluded to a perf package 330 being 39k by saying if you were spending 33 what was a 6k more i just priced out a 330 perf pack with just enough options so that it would equal a g35 or cts in fairly basic form msrp came to 45k msrp on my 330i with perf metallic paint xenon leather and sunroof was 43k i paid 39k for it in may of 2003 so that 330 with perf pack is at the very least 10k more than a g35 or cts yeah i had negotiated a g35 down to 30k with the stuff i wanted still i wasnt overwhelmed by the g putting price aside the 3 series sedan simply isnt big enough for a trip of any length to have adults in the back seat unless theyre all of shorter statue a not my problem as im in the drivers seat\\nb if they dont like it they can take a different car\\nc most of my female friends are shorter than fivefive\\nd i dont know 3 other males id drive anywhere with for five minutes let alone to vegas 300 miles i think the rest of us g35tlctsls93 will find wonderful ways to spend our 10k thats my response to people who brag they paid cash for a car  3040k id rather drop that as a downpayment on a house rent the place get 20 roi a year and a fat tax write off we all value things differently the car to me will disappear the happiness will be a great memory and we can always make more money i love the concept of a hardtop convertible sport sedan not sold on the look  but thats useless compared to the fun  of the is replacement v8 power also troubles me still its an intriguing concept hey just got the mt issue the comparo again they are trying to unseat the 3series which was not invited this time but several accolades and comparisons to the 3 here are some of the results all 5 speed autos overall 1 g3531485\\n2 cts 3643880\\n3 tl35195\\n4 9338755 more

covered the quarter mile in 143 seconds at 97 mph it seems that you either love or hate the cts styling the first time i saw onei loved it so you know what camp im in on that issue     i just put a coat of meguiars new nxt generation tech wax on it this morning and man does that dark blue metallic paint shine on there with the mirror finished alloy wheels setting it off the cts is one fine looking car i find myself looking back at it in parking lots a lot as i walk awayand it does turn heads on the road \\n   i need the car i drive to look rich and distinctive to be somthing that is not mistaken for a dozen other similiar cars the cts does that in spades the claring weakness of tl is 1000 braking downright ridiculous and dangerous compared to the others there should be no excuse for it at all i drive previous gen tl regularly now that i know i will be extra careful in hi speed driving brembo is more of a name brand than substancethe g without the brembos stops faster i bet too the motor trend comparison test was of cars with automatic transmissions dont the brembo brakes come standard on the manual transmission versions of tl can you upgrade the base automatics brakes ie are the brembos optional on automatics know the aspec with at comes with brembos check out the may 2004 issue of cd page 132 their short take on the tl aspec they tested a 6speed manual msrp astested was 40895 over base of 38895 they titled it gilding the wrong parts of the lily 060 mph in 56 secs\\n560 mph in 62 secs\\n14 mile in 143 secs at 99 mph\\n700 braking in 174 ft\\nskidpad 090g\\ntop speed 152 mph drag limited they didnt see a significant difference in performance over base tl 6speed manual in acceleration braking or skidpad numbers braking performance was actually worse one big problem remains torque steer what the aspec package does not address however is the biggest flaw of a tl with a manual transmission and thats torque steer tramp on the throttle in one of the lower gears and theres still that heavy tug at the steering wheel particularly on pavement with lots of variations appears that unlike bmw and its successful performanceenhancing 330i perf pkg zhp acura followed same mistakes lexus did with its failed is300 ltuned and sportdesign programs huge chunk of money for styling mods i find myself looking back at it in parking lots a lot as i walk awayand it does turn heads on the road  the aztek turned heads too i need the car i drive to look rich and distinctive to be somthing that is not mistaken for a dozen other similiar cars the cts does that in spades you need this like a doctor prescribed zou should geet a kar zhat attacks attention zoo need dis you want a polarizing car none of us need the entrylux cars we have a 5 year old accord would get the job done riez ill never quite get how lexus could try to snake thousands of dollars for ltuned upgrades without increasing the performance weird what do you think of that possible is replacement talk about polarizing the brake sizes for the new tl were posted here a week or so ago and i was wondering how they compared to my e39 530i tlauto 3575 lbs  1140 x 110 vented front  1110 x 035 solid rear\\ntlmanu 3482 lbs  1220 x 098 vented front  1110 x 035 solid rear\\n530i5sp 3494 lbs  1275 x 120 vented front  1175 x 079 vented rear interesting reading best regards\\nshipo good point about the aztekbut that one turns heads because its uncommonly ugly not so the cts at the price point of the cars were discussing were not buying them just for basic transportationa 10 thousand dollar kia will get you from point a to point b the participants in this forum are looking for something more from their car we want that trip from point a to point b to be enjoyable\\n   styling will always be a personal preference heck the new bmw look has drawn very mixed reactions car stylists have to be more then just safe they need some originality something in their designs that show that they can do something more then just copy whats already been done if not the roads will be filled with unassuming vehicles that may be pleasent but sure not exciting im obviously missing something because when they first tested the tl they pulled a 81g on the skidpad so now its getting 9 with the addon package they didnt see a significant difference in performance over base tl 6speed manual in acceleration braking or skidpad numbers adding almost a full g is no small feat by any means so where am i misreading 10 if a g adding a whole g and youd have the grippiest car ever and id be in it good point about the aztekbut that one turns heads because its uncommonly ugly not so the cts beauty is in the eye of the beholder all of cadillacs current styling strikes me for all the wrong reasons then again im not a fan of flat surfaces even if theyre bisecting other lines  like the new 5 and the sides of the g35 sedan and coupe  theres too much flat metal and no hint of muscularity styling will always be a personal preference heck the new bmw look has drawn very mixed reactions car stylists have to be more then just safe they need some originality something in their designs that show that they can do something more then just copy whats already been done if not the roads will be filled with unassuming vehicles that may be pleasent but sure not exciting true  the styling of the g and tl strike me as conservative and safe with a slight twist the audis got a gorgeous bauhaus thing going the 3s sporting a classic crouched feline look the isto me goes more for an anime blocky smoothed over thing  i cant help but think of japanese cartoons when i see them to me though design is the last reason to buy a car what it looks like on the outside isnt relevant really as long as its clean i really dig the look of the saab 93 i dont care for the interior or whats under the hoodother than the aero but the styling is different and very attractive edmunds images looks like a 3 series had a baby with a passatnot bad but i can help but think malibui max everytime i see oneand reliablity will be interesting on these guys  prob much better than before tho qbrozen you should read cds short take they were comparing their results to the tl results published in the march 2004 comparison test in the comparo the standard 6speed manual tl pulled a respectible 089 g the yokohamashod tl aspec managed 090 700 mph braking for aspec was 174 feet versus 160 ft for the base tl blueguydotcom you should check out the latest issue of automobile magazine they chart projected changes plus interesting story about upcoming bmw 2 series when i get my next car my kids will be gone ill likely get a coupe or convertible thinking i want something smaller lighter and less complex no need for idrive nav system all the electrogizmos etc maybe a turbocharged miata m2 but id also consider g35 coupe maybe is coupeconvertible im very sad that lexus is abandoning the better i6 configuration for plebian v6 that is something that makes the 3 series and is300 special they better keep lsd jealousy is a disease  it seems everycareveryone is gunning at tl now lol if you need to go really fast into a corner lets say 100mph then a little torque steerhandling is a problem to most people it doesnt matter at all especially who can handle it if you cant well buy another one 7k is too much already  if you need to go really fast into a corner lets say 100mph then a little torque steer is a problem torque steer happens when you accelerate quickly from a stop the car will pull to the right and may need correction to keep it straight i think the biggest problem with the tl is not so much torque steer but the fact that it is too nose heavy the latter affects handling and braking notice that the best handling sedans have nearly 5050 weight distribution then again im not a fan of flat surfaces even if theyre bisecting other lines  like the new 5 and the sides of the g35 sedan and coupe  theres too much flat metal and no hint of muscularity blueguy\\nare you serious\\ni know exterior is subjective but do you seriously think the g35 coupe does not have a muscular look to it if that is the case than you are in the minority    i need the car i drive to look rich and distinctive to be something that is not mistaken for a dozen other similar cars the cts does that in spades scott1\\ni also think this car is a love it or hate it type of car i would fall into the hate it category the new sts is a big improvement in styling over the cts\\nas far as exclusivity goes i dont know where you drive but the only types of autos around here that stand out are your lamborghinirollsetci have never given a second look to a cts  although i rarely see an m45 around town maybe the cts falls along the same linesrelax caddy fans im just kidding i know the cts outsells the m45 by a wide margin sorry i dont feel any of it i floored it once against mustang gt i didnt feel any vsc and lsd handled it nicely do you own the car or just assuming it there have been plenty of times where i146ve experience torque steer that wasn146t induced by off the line acceleration for instance there is a grade on i80 heading east from hackensack toward the george washington bridge on that grade what with all of the traffic that road gets the asphalt in each lane has been pressed into what sort of looks like an old country dirt lane the lane divider regions and the middle of the lanes are an easy two to three inches higher than the rutted area where the tires typically run when climbing that hill with anything beyond the power necessary to maintain your speed the car starts to wander around the ruts it is a very nervous feeling and depending upon the quality of the car and its suspension the phenomena ranges from mildly distracting to highly annoying in fact i146ve driven a few cheap rentals up that grade that were down right scary ive also driven a number of rwd cars up that same grade and never experience a single wander regardless of how much i was into the go pedal fwdtorque steerbad best regards\\nshipo all fwdtorque steerbad is wrong common fwdtorque steerbad true fwdtltorque steerbad wrong they do put tl in comparisons or to compete with any rwd every magazine does it why not common fwd like es maxima any reason why  danny wanna feel torque steer make sure the wheels are straight floor it from a stop without your hands on the steering wheel you car will veer rightyou just experienced torque steer like i said i didnt feel any if you feel it either you have the wrong fwd but definitely not the tl fyi the rpm did go up fast but the car seemed adjusting itself vsclsd must have got something to do with it mustang gt a rwd when accelerating fast from a stop sometimes instead of going straight it spins maybe it was a fwd danny i didnt feel a thing cuz i never drove the new tl but every magazine article ever written about the new tl mentions noticeable torque steer on the on it you know why mine is an auto lol chrisboth  sorry typing faster than my brain you knew what i meant shipo  i was trying to look at it online and their march comparo doesnt state the tl skidpad number unless im missing it but regardless its interesting that their january test of the car netted a much lower number if 89 is true then i certainly wouldnt bother with the aspec pack interestingly enough the january review also calls attention to the fact that the 81 was not up to snuff against the g35s 87 so what happens the tl pulls a 89 and the g35 pulls a 90 in the march comparo hmmmmm and by the way according to the april issue the 330i with performance pack pulled a 86 83 without you know why mine is an auto that shouldnt make a difference not all fwd equipped with tcs vsa lsd tl has them all thats the difference next time maybe the shawd tl who knows i hate to be pedantic but what youre describing isnt torque steerits tramlining i think its highly correlated to tire height my 3series

lunch i just hit some curvy fun roads  over and over lunch smunch ive got 20 mph corners to take at insane speeds does you zhp have a staggered setup ive been told that staggered tire sizes increase tramlining while i cant say for sure if this is true or not i do notice that my staggered 8month setup 24540r and 22545f tramlines much worse than my nonstaggered winter setup 22545s on all corners other factors that may play into this are softer sidewalls on winter package different tread patternsmaterials that extra inch of tread width on the rears during the summer may be just enough to catch more edges in the road maybe a combination of them or maybe none at all lunch smunch ive got 20 mph corners to take at insane speeds get yourself a sports car and youll never eat lunch again not to mention all the hooky youll be playing i live for corners bobbin weavin stoppin goin rowing the 6speed about torque steer and radical maneuvering away from trouble heres what cr wrote about these issues after their tl road test the acura feels taut and responsive in cornering with wellcontained body lean the nicely weighted steering is communicative and quick in emergencyhandling tests the tl demonstrated good tire grip and cornering balance and it proved secure in our avoidance maneuver where it posted a quick 525mph powered by a smooth 270hp 32liter v6 the tl is noticeably quicker than many of its competitors even with such high horsepower the car was largely devoid of torque steer sort of the exact opposite of the rt article dont read the magazines and then quote them herewe all subscribe to the same rags if youre going to say its got torque steer why dont you test drive one and then report back say what my 35 series tires on my 330i tramline like crazy yeahtheyre 35 series i didnt say what direction the correlation was i figured it was obvious kahunah there is a huge difference between the complete absence of something and being largely devoid of that something the former has none of it while the latter still does a bit like deciding whether to worry upon entering a building that was labelled largely devoid of anthrax as cd and others have written the torque steer issue is most problematic with manual transmisson tls by its very nature the slushbox works to amelieorate much though not all of the inherent torque steer does you zhp have a staggered setup ive been told that staggered tire sizes increase tramlining while i cant say for sure if this is true or not i do notice that my staggered 8month setup 24540r and 22545f tramlines much worse than my

rears during the summer may be just enough to catch more edges in the road maybe a combination of them or maybe none at all they are staggered so that may play a role in it by its very nature the slushbox works to amelieorate much though not all of the inherent torque steer not to mention its negative impact on fun too most of what ends up getting posted these days is the same subjects and opinions that were being discussed a month agotorque steer my car is faster than your car handles better is prettier etc etc etc\\ni took a five hour road trip to eastern washington and back to play golf today and to just drive my tl great road to drive leading up to a mountain pass and through a gorgeous canyon with a river running next to the road the tl is such a nice road car i wasnt throwing it around as some do mostly because the road is notorious for state police and sure enough they were out at 700 am when i was driving over sun was up at 700 and i drove home in 80 degree temperatures i really got a dose of what a near luxury sport sedan is about\\nthe car is extremely comfortable great sound system fun to drive fast when you can and i got 30 miles per gallon coming home because there was enough traffic you couldnt really drive fast i didnt feel any torque steer and i was doing 80 through some of the corners going over in the morning\\nthere surely are some differences in the cars being discussed here but the numbers are so small as to be almost inconsequential in most cases 89 versus 90 skidpad56 versus 58 060\\ni believe the kind of driving i did today is the true measure of a near luxury sport sedan because i think it represents the kind of driving that 99 of the people who own these cars actually do i am sure that my trip would have been just as enjoyable in a 330i or a g or an is 300 i just happen to own a tl and today i was really pleased that i do having taken several road trips myself to cottage country niagaraonthelake and our nations capital ottawa in the last few months that included snow covered roads i know exactly how you feel as you cruise down the highway passing all the slower cars and enjoying the view you smile and think to youselfthis is one great road car lets hear from the other members about great and maybe not so great road trips theyve taken recently with their entrylevel luxury performance sedans i wish i could take extended road trips in every car in this class i am sure that everyone of them would be fun and offer something a little different from the others those driving manner are dangerous no matter what but not the car tl is one of the highest safety rating car and tl is also capable of doing those but do you really need that challenging the unexpected is it possible without endangering others i dont think any of these car in this category is considered as a sport car do you challenging the unexpected is it possible without endangering others life is short enjoy it while you can i dont think any of these car in this category is considered as a sport car do you not many sports cars still made  miata 350z rx8 vette and the rest are over 50k so while not sports cars we do have sports sedans  best of both

consider  vw passat w8 audi a6 subaru legacy nissan maxima in fact if i had to pick one it would the passat w8 cause it has some performance some luxury but most importantly it says middle class suburbs hmmm my definition if tramlining is when you are driving on roads primarily in california that have parallel grooves cut in them for water relief so as to help prevent hydroplaning my definition of torque steer is when the driven front wheels take steering matters into their own hands when power is applied especially during a turn or when the road surface is sloped when i described the phenomena on i80 which is relatively smooth asphalt and has two ruts one for the left tire and one for the right i was referring to torque steer at least according to my definition best regards\\nshipo definition the annoying tendency of some frontwheel drive vehicles to pull to one side when engine torque is applied in other words you step on the gas and the car wants to steer right or left by redesigning the power train to use equal length half shafts between the transaxle and wheels the tendency towards torque steer can be greatly reduced the other cure is to keep off the gas you are right life is short make a good use of it and dont waste it we do have sports sedan and i prefer the real sedan sizenot the civic size sedan with a lot of comforting features and great power thats what makes the car alive the lifespan of a car is so short enjoy it while you can cheers  my family and i are taking our volvo v70 on a road trip to so cal this summeri am looking forward to the chance to stretch the volvos legs i just took a short road trip to bellingham and back last week unfortunately it was in my company cara 2000 chevy lumina 31l its actually a very comfortable highway car  quiet soft suspension and soft seats for commuting its actually more than adequate highway 9 is the road to ride to bham an enthusiasts delight yeah ive spent some time on 9 mostly down south near monroelake stevens but i have been up further around sedro wooley too i once read that one of the best roads in washington is highway 11 or is it 12 that goes from mt vernon to fairhaven i drove it once last year when my wife and i went to la conner for the weekend and it was a nice ride sometimes gotta keep the pace down because of bicycles have you heard of it i have a 1998 a4 28 i know previous model things i dont like about it\\n a bit too small especially back seat wkids\\n climate control fan is too noisy and not enough ac for the fan speed\\n not enough low end torque with 4wd things i like about the audi\\n interior quality\\n steering is impeccable\\n bose is excellent\\n shifter and clutch like butter i drove a g35 6mt a few months ago for curiosity great engine and steering things i didnt like\\n interior is only fair after having an audi\\n steering  i drove about 70 mph around a sweeping freeway interchange ramp theres a spot where the pavement changes and theres a 121 inch elevation difference when i hit it in the g35 the steering wheel wanted to jerk out of my hand  thats the sort of realworld handling i dont like i tried the same spot and speed later in my a4 and there was virtually no kick in the steering wheel in conclusion the interior and this steering behavior were enough to rule out the g35 for me im now looking at the tl i drove an automatic and liked it quite a bit im going to go check out the 6mt is this the first post of the next millenium what size tires and wheels does your a4 have i have the sport package and the tire size is 20555 zr 16 i originally had the dunlop sp8000s i then switched to bridgestone potenza re940s which i actually like less they are very firm and noisier than the dunlops both zrated clarification on my previous post i liked the steering feel of the g35 but when hitting bumps while in a turn at high crusing speed moderate amount of lateral gs the steering jerked quite readily while my a4 does not do that yet the a4 retains an excellent road feel as does the g35 yes i know the road from mt vernon to fairhaven i have relatives in bham and go there a lot i live in maltby just off of highway 9 i wouldnt recommend spirited driving on the road from mt vernon to fairhaven as there is a lot of slow traffic as for bicyclesi am a cyclist myself so i appreciate anyone who looks out for me  as you cruise down the highway passing all the slower cars and enjoying the view you smile and think to youselfthis is one great road car i know how you feel too kahunah like you own the road  i dont go over speed limit thou but i like it when someone try to test the cars acceleration and they usually slow downafter they got the message as i will too if they dont i know you know this now i really enjoy turning onoff onto ram but i always limit myself not to do that at night i need to see the road clearly be safe is more important nothing can make me more happier than being inside this car  i know exactly what youre talking about it seems to me that thats part of the german car specialness they provide good feedback while not exhibiting many of the foibles other performance cars posess if all we want is leather gadgets and lots of hp we all have to feel bad about the 33k 57l gto in the end arguing that one luxury car bests another based on hp is like telling me that _i_ should prefer brick cheese to brie because its more cheese per dollar but on topic the best road trip i took for pure driving fun was driving from santa fe to taos theres two routes both gorgeous once leaving taos there was a row of 20 cars all bumper to bumper climbing uphill at 25mph i knew id never be able to pass the entire caravan on the windy road ahead so i dropped to second and passed 25 cars on a long uphill redlining third at the end it paid off there was hardly any other cars on the road following that and the twisties were great fun dave tramlining seems to correlate strongly with tire tread patterns as well  see any online tire store reviews of similarly sized high performance tires my own view is that fwd vs rwd is not a factor in tramlining  its tirerelated as for torquesteer in the tl ive experienced a little bit of it in my two week old automatic offtheline as others have noted but it hasnt been problematic car and driver has noted that torque steer is far more bothersome in the manual its come down to the wire with in the next 3 weeks now i plan on getting a new vehicle yet ive narrowed it down to these two cars the acura tl wo nav and mb c class there are things i like on both cars and things i dislike and ive come to the point where i dont know what else to do now in my opinion the tls interior is better than the cs but well the mb has some nice features like tele aidmaint minder which tl has too but the mb is more indepth and rain sensing winshield wipers and auto up and down for all for windows yet the tl has the surround sound a first for cars so what would you guys suggest anything else i should try and figure out between these two cars im thinkin there pretty much equal only thing that bothers me about the mercedes really is that the c230 sport sedan is kinda underpowerd which can be remadeed by getting the manny which im still learning how to drive please help i prefer the cclass but if you care about reliability go with the acura mb is having tons of quality issues lately unless you dont mind visiting your mb dealer often acura is the answer two folks in my office own sclass mbs and there is always something wrong they are getting rid of them good luck acura is more reliable better built swifter better handling and a better car all the way around for less money a comparable c class will run far more than that tls 3435k and you get a smaller less agile less powerful less reliable car with the c wheres the problem yea but as my father would say a mercedes is a mercedes ive heard of problems with reliability but my father seems to think thats not true  i like the fact that its a mercedes and my uncle has one and has no problems with it but i dont know ive yet to hear anything serious about the tl minus the tires flat spotting but im changing those out anyways so i dont care personally i like the tl better even though that in my area i can get the mb with the same equipment or relatively close for the same price yet when i say same price im taking the number from the tmv on the mercedes and comparing it to the msrp on the tl and i know im not paying sticker for the tl so in my opinion the tl is comes out cheaper i just dont want to make the wrong choice and be stuck with a car also i plan on tinting the windows will it pose any problem with either car if i get them tinted i want them tinted for summers ause it helps to keep the car cooler thankx from someone who has owned an 03 c230 sport sedan 6spd manual for a little over one year the cclass is clearly the better choice first of all the rwd and sport suspension make the c class a better handling car sorry tltsx lovers but i am another rwd or bust kind of guy secondly my car msrp was 32k and i paid 31k for c2 package rain sensor power rear sunshade and power sunroof 6 disc changer heated seats and premium bose system imo the look of the c class is much classier and all around better looking than the non descript honda lineup especially the sport sedans 17inch wheeltire combo and sidefrontrear skirting and if cjs2002 can wait for the 05 mb cclass sport sedan the interior is far better looking than the 03 or 04 the tl interior is a nice piece but it still screams accord and in the reliability department my car has only been to the shop for its one routinefree scheduled maintenance at 10k i currently have 14k miles honestly cjs2002 you wont go wrong with either car but the c class was an easy choice for me last january when i ordered mine even over the much loved g35 sedan   imo i just dont love the exterior or interior of the g now the g35 coupe is the car i would love to own but my little 1 year old and his car seat were not a good match for that back seat happy shopping do you think the refershed c class interior is less good as well they did just upgrade the cclass interior i dont know what id get if i were to pick between those id try to live with each for a day  traffic shopping highway  and see how i felt after that remember what some magazine or guy on the web tells you plays no role in your personal satisfaction dave if for 05 the c230 was getting a power boost then yea id get it probably when i drove the c it just seemed a tad sluggish though i must commend it in the fact that its as tight and quite as a button this weekend im going to try and get the dealor ship to let me take each car out for a day and just drive them dont care if its a loaner or what not just as long as i see how it drives  the acura and mb dealorships are right acrost the street from one another so it makes looking and comparing easierits come down now to which one offers the features i like better both are great cars i just need to figure out what will suite me better now i have a c240 with a 6speed and 32000 miles the car is a little under powered for me and that is why i am on the g35 board thinking about a new car in about a year i will say the reliability on my mb has not been too bad the fuel gauge was about 2 gallons off and replaced the sending unit and the tape deck door would not open  the entire head unit was replaced everything under warranty so that was 2 problems if i bought a japanese car i would expect 1 problem in 32000 miles the car is solid as brick  no squeeks or rattles at all according to the last service my\\nbrake pads are not even at 50 wear which is not bad cosidering 80 of my driving is in the city the 6speed can easily get 30 miles per gallon on the highway i do wish the interior was a bit wider and like i said i want more power however whenever i see an officer around a blind bend with a radar gun i am glad i dont have the extra hp whatever i have i will use you do really need to take both out on an extended drive i have seen photos of the new c dash board and it looks much better yes i looked at the c230 mainly because it has a bit more umf behind it when i test drove one i found it to be very quite and rifined yet i had the dealorship guy with me so i wasnt able to actually consintrate because he kept yappin im going to go with my father this weekend and drive both cars for an extended time maybe take one out for the day my dad refuses to let dealers come with us so hes comming with me this weekend to take a look and finally make a decision between the two cars i just dont want to make the wrong choice and be stuck with a car roll the dice cars are a lousy purchase anyway which ever one stirs the soul is the one to buy imho i bought a bmw  and that was after my horrendous experience with another german car  knowing itd be a poorly built vehicle it hasnt been as shoddy as my jetta but my bmws certainly not as well made as my last japanese car  a dowdy but solid 91 nissan stanza still my bimmer is fun and makes me smile regardless of the trips to the dealer if it were out of warrantyitd be for sale yes i will sell my mb before warranty goes byebye if repairs are coming out of my pocket i will not own a german car i am too cheap if you taking mt c230 might have enof power but not with at in my mind tl is a better car it handles just as good as rwd c230 has more power better trany 6mt and the car cost much less mb does look classy but i would wait when im 40 to take classy car like that i plan to get my windows tinted mainly to reduce heat in the summer my question is will tinting the windows mess with any systems of the car i know the mb has the rain sensing windshield wipers but i dont know if it would affect that or not and how bout the tl will it affect any of its systems though i dont think the one wo nav has anything that it would affect but im not sure any one know geez i came here to learn about the g35x as im considering buying one you know its from infiniti all wheel drive is the nav any good any experiences to talk about after flipping back four pages ive read about every car except the g35 anyone know where that forum is grin you seem really focused on the frills maybe you should look into which one has better safety record because while youre futzing with the auto winshield wipers or the nav you might get into trouble not looking for any with the nav nor do i really care about the auto wipers yet i must admit their cool i just dont want to do anything that may lead to an infamous trip to dealorship i wish to try and avoid going to the dealorship for anything i might cause  yea but as my father would say a mercedes is a mercedes nothing could be further from the truth dont worry about what daddy thinks unless hes footing the bill a 3 pointed star emblem does not automatically make it a great car unless you just like the idea of having a benz if thats the case welcome to poser city i second that cjs2002  you should also be concerned at the fact that not one mercedes model is recommended by consumer reportsnot a one all the models have predicted reliability ratings that are either fair or poor another thing you can spend 80k mercedes and if there is a warranty repair they rent you a car if your mb needs to stay for a few days no mb loaners at least none here in the sflorida dealers lexus gives you a lexus loaner jag gives you a jag audi gives you an audi i think it is nuts here let me help you out\\ninfinity g35 i spent 31k for my benz and i recd a benz loaner when i dropped off my car for my one scheduled maint not sure why that is happening in your neck of the woods speedracer3\\nin nj all of the mercedes dealers i have dealt with give you either a c240 or ml350 cjs2002\\ni have tinted the windows on several cars they have a tint which keeps the car cooler than your regular tint you would find in the store i dont know the type but ask the place who will install it if they are familiar i have had every type of vehicle you could imagine tinted from infinitilexusmercedesfordetc never had a problem hi there from your question im guessing that you are using the makemodel search tools to display discussions that involve the g35 and perhaps misunderstanding your results this entry level performance sedans discussion is about a number of vehicles  you can read pat mar 19 2004 634 to see the list our discussions get categorized based on what they are about since this discussion includes the g35 that vehicle is one of the categories and that means when you list discussions that include the g35 this one shows up but it doesnt mean that the only subject here is the g35 i hope this helps explain things but if not feel free to drop me an email oh and it seems that qbrozens link goes to messages that are a couple of years old  here is a link that will get you to the current messages infiniti g35 thanks qbrozen  you have to drop the  at the end of a link in order to get to the current posts not sure why that is happening in your neck of the woods me neither they must not have enough mbs to give out maybe they sell too many mb dealers here in s florida have an rental car places right in the dealerships shrug do they still use film and then manually apply it with some kind of adhesive becuase back in the day when i had it done the thing started to bubble horribly in 3 or 4 years it was the worst on hatchbacks because the back hatch faced the sun more directly side windows didnt have as much of a problem so the 200300 they charge you doesnt seem like a good deal the factory tint jobs must put the tinting inside the glass or something because they dont seem to have the bubbling problem place i plan to get it tinted from comes with a lifetime garontee so long as i own the car if it peals or bubles or fades in any way theyll replace it had them re do my windows on my explorer with the mirror tint and havent had a problem though have gotten pulled over once but lied and said i bought it that way finally got to drive a g35x today nearest dealer is 50 miles away on my way to the ny auto show looking for some feedback from others who have driven both this and either a 325xi or 330xi  i drove both of those a month ago that dealer only 45 miles away  in a different direction my needs list  awd highly reliable compact size fun to drive and it falls off after that price is a consideration my observations\\nawd performance  ill never know from a test drive not in nasty snow  assume they are both good price  g35x by a couple thousand or more depending on if i compare to 325 or 330 reliability  varies by the individual car of course but infiniti looks to have significantly better odds size  comparable but the bmw seemed a little cramped to me the oftrepeated comments about the grade of the interior between the two is of lesser concern to me  both are fine fun  this is a little harder since the lag between my drive times was long but heres how it felt and im looking for your observations there is a noticeable power difference between the 325 and the other 2 maybe daily it doesnt matter but its easy to feel otherwise the power seemed to me to come on much more smoothly in the 330 than the g35 g35 might ride better but i also felt that it was a little oversensitive to minor inputs and i didnt feel that in the bmw they all braked strongly as much as i can test in a test drive im not looking to restart the i love my xxx its the best wars but i would be interested in hearing from those who have driven both or all 3 all are seemingly very nice  even nearluxury  cars interesting cars from the show in their awd versions which sometimes means coming soon  lexus 2005 gs saab 92 even if it is a subaru  acura rl but too big for me acura said all their cars would be awd if i wanted to wait infinity m again too big though it was crowded down there today bad weather or not i had a 99 328i for just over five years and purchased a g35x back in january i test drove the 325ix and 330ix as well as the a4 18t and 30 my opinions were similar to yours  bmw engines are the smoothest out there and my 328i was the smoothest of any car ive ever driven i think they get better with age if the abs system hadnt gone 3000 estimated to repair id still be driving it for sure the g35 engine is great and very powerful but somehow not as much fun to rev to the redline as the bmw engines\\n 325 and audi engines just didnt have enough torque for me the audi felt nice but the throttle response wasnt there for me\\n g35 is bigger than the other cars significantly in overall size somewhat less significantly in interior room but still its a bigger car with more room which was a positive for me\\n handling was similar in all  excellent as you can see i like all of the cars in the end the decision for me came down to value and reliability the g35x simply is a great value when compared to the bmws and audis sure the interior plastics arent quite up to snuff but the leather is nicer in my opinion its the most powerful in the group and your reliability odds are definitely better with inifiniti no matter which you choose youll love the car its a great choice to have i agree w rderizans that the leather in the g is nicer but i prefer softer leathers the biggest weakness of the g is grade of interior materials other than seats but if youre not bothered by them the g35x should be a top candidate seeing that the power difference or lack thereof in the 325ix was noticeable to you id recommend not getting it might nag you constantly the 330ix is a fine machine you cant go wrong with it either ah thank you been trying to get that right for some time now before i purchased my g35coupe my close second was the bmw 330i325ci i must admit before i test drove the 325ciwsporti expected the car to be a dog and much to my surprise it was reasonably fast the 330iwsport was a wonderful car to drive it was smooth and felt like it took far less effort to pick up speed i have nothing negative to say about how the 330i drives i just think the look is a little dated to me and the 3 series around here are far too common when my g35coupe was in for service i was given a g35x i happened to get caught in the middle of an unexpected snow storm it handled very well i never had any problems the entire day now it was not on the same level as my wifes a6 quattro but the car handling capabilities are more than adequate i prefer the interior of the 3 series but i agree with some others on this board with regard to the seats the seats are more comfortable in the g my 2001 c320 stopped while i was on highway\\nall lights came up the fuel gauge showed that i still have half tank of gas but the end of fuel light was on at the same time this light did not come up before that moment the roadside assistant came in 45 minutes checked and added some gas the car worked again it seems it was a fuel gauge malfunction\\nwill there be any harm to the engine or anything since i drove the car at very low fuel level\\nany comments i am in north jersey let me tell you my recent experience with the dealer loaner my 2001 car has 38k miles on it when you make regular service appointment they put you at least 3 weeks later and give you a 2004 loaner 1 in march something was wrong on the car i called they scheduled it 3 weeks later i asked if they can make it earlier because i was not sure if the problem was critical or not they said they can but they dont have loaner i have to rent a car at my own expense 2 10 days ago my car was hit by a lostcontrol car some bodyworks need to be done i have to rent a car myself  i dont blame them for this one 3 this moring my car stopped on highway  see my previous post the malfunction fuel gauge showed that i have half tank of gas actually the tank is empty when i call the dealer they said they can treat it as urgent service but again i have to rent a car at my own expense because they dont have loaner you can get a loaner if you schedule the service several weeks earlier if it is anything urgent comes up sorry you have to rent a car yourself the problems are\\n1 they want to cut loaner cost by having less loaners\\n2 the mb cars have too many problems people are busy bringing in their cars to get fixed i hope i havent bought this car i am thinking about selling this car before the warranty expires i just cant afford the time the money and the patience i just cant finally a funny thing when i was at the dealer\\nseveral days ago i overheard a lady who drives a coupe complained a problem i told her i have had that problems about 10 times she said thats no big deal she still have had a problem b problem c problems it seems to be going downhill fast consumer reports jd power and other publications show mb below the industry average in reliability the principals at my company all own mbs and are looking to dump themthe cars have tons of problems i wouldnt touch mb with a ten foot barge pole one more question  do you regret not getting the 6 spd manual i am really considering the g coupe as a 3rd car and have found 6 03 g coupes  several carmax locations on the east coast five of them are automatics  one is manual however the one manual has basically every option including the overpriced nav and they want 34k for it the autos have the prem package and are stickering for 3031k i have always owned manuals but i have been strongly considering going the auto route for traffics sake did you test drove both does the automatic feel like it is giving anything up to the stick thanks for your opinions anyone else owning the g coupe feel free to fill me inthanks i think the purpose of introducing an entrylevel car of this kind is to seduce the young and notthatrich people into the mb world and buy high end cars when they get older or richer\\nbut it seems this c class really prevent people from looking further at other series does anybody know if the e or s series have problems as well when i decided to buy this car there were not so many entry level luxury cars out there despite of all the bad comments from other owners i still decided to buy it i made a mistake the reports that i have heard have indicated that the sclass reliability is actually worse due to all of the electronic wizardry and telematics systems ive also heard that the bmw 745i has a similar level of problems i havent heard as much about the eclass so im not sure if that means it has less problems than the sclass or not jeff one s430 and an s500 here at work they have a second home at the mercedes dealership every other month did you test drove both does the automatic feel like it is giving anything up to the stick thanks for your opinions test drove both night and day the auto like all autos lags and removes the driver too much from interacting with the engine while i do not live in the city there is still too much congestion for me to go with a manual the auto was the only option for me\\n my g35 coupe is also a 3rd car situation but i just do not have the patience for a manual in the area i live in my experiences the manual version will always give you a closer connection between the driver and their car as blueguydotcom stated but i disagree with his statement about the auto g35coupe the manumatic is better than what you will find offered on most vehicles in a similar price range that was pretty straight forward that much of a difference huh  that is kind of a bummer but i guess that is why i have only owned manuals anyone else who has test driven or owns one do you feel the same as blueguy that was what i was hoping to hear i am going to give it a try next week i will let you know my impressions\\nthanks again i just drove a g35x auto i found the tiptronic style shifter pretty nice and smooth if its your 3rd car as in you have 3 at once not sequentially maybe you can stick with the stick but since you mention traffic my wife and i always owned manuals until the day i broke tibiafibula playing soccer switched one to auto then and as traffic built up and commute got worse switched the other car drove a loaner stick recently and it was just great fun but probably wont go back question im trying to understand if audis reliability is any better than mbs per the surveys audis shouldnt be touched either as it is even worse m the a4 has average reliability thats why i got it i cant speak for the rest of the line but you are probably right both mb and audi are risky propositions we have an a6 and i could not recommend the car our car has had one problem after the next although i know a couple of a4 owners who swear by their car consumer reports doesnt recommend any of the mb or audi models they do however highly recommend the vw passat id still rather have the a4 over the passat audis are better put together than their vw counterparts besides audi service is light years better than vw so if something were to go wrong id rather be driving an audi id rather have the a4 over the passat too but i just find it curious that the reliability of the passat hasnt extended to its luxo counter parts a4 a6 etc the japanese auto makers seem to have a much easier time of it accordtl maximag35 camryes330 etc every one of these cars are recommended by cr i dont understand why cr recommends the passat if you frequent vw boards like i do you find a large number of irate passat owners while  a4 boards folks spend most of the time talking about the mods theyve made on their cars go figure im posing this question to the group because i think its only a matter of time before the korean auto makers hyundai in particular introduce a luxury car line to compete in this market segment it may take them a few years to catch up but we all know how patient the koreans are theyve come a long way and have proven their capabilities with cars like the xg350 hyundais flagship luxury model which is recommended by cr in fact hyundai currently has three models recommended by cr im all for hyundaikia and their cars they definitely improved on their quality and reliability i have no doubt that they will soon offer a bona fide entrylevel luxury sedan offering but they still have a long way to go in terms of performance they will probably try to make an es330 fighter at some point which is good because the es330 is currently in a category all by itself among import sedans yes but have you seen the latest sidecrash results hyundai scored near the bottom of the list as poor yes but have you seen the latest sidecrash results hyundai scored near the bottom of the list as poor im not sure what study youre referring to the nhtsa sidecrash test ratings for 2004 sonata elantra xg350 and santa fe were all either four or five stars i guess there was some other study that found otherwise what i was surprised to find was that the 2004 3series sedan had a three star front side impact rating edit i see the iihs study now not true for the hyundai xg350 cr reports 1 government side crash tests results where rated very good for both driver and rear passenger 2 the iihs frontal offset crash test was rated good overall but hyundai would be crazy to enter the market now when their cars cant even compete well with camrys and accords except on price they would be skipping quite a few steps if they tried now and the risk of failure would be far higher even more established german brands like vw try to ease in their transition eg the passat is slowly moving upmarket and the phaeton clearly is though the brand still isnt and if vw has so much trouble and may yet not succeed imagine how much more difficult it woulf be for hyundai the xg350 may be a great car by hyundai standards but do you really think its competitive  just because toyota nissan and honda made it to the top doesnt mean that hyundai has a place reserved on that gravy train evidence 1 hyundai sales have been off quite a bit this year evidence 2 they just have to up incentives by quite a bit httpwwwdetnewscom2004autosinsider040420c02127757htm i think its much more likely hyundai will join mazdamitsusubaru as 2nd tier brand hyundai and its corporate sister kia doesnt produce any car that is really performance oriented not even the tiburon which is more good looks over performance will be interesting to see ifwhen they try to get into the performance sedan market due to tooling and other issues doubt theyll be selling a rwd car in usa any time soon but i will say that my work 00 hyundai sonata gls v6 with 5speed manual tc and abs has been quite reliable and a pleasant car to own  drive if hyundai or any other lowpriced brand wanted to enter the luxury market theyd have to first create a new brand like honda nissan and toyota did honda nissan  toyota are the top 3 of reliability without that my guess is they would not have challenged the europeans successfully most of the other japanese makes and hyundai are not in the same reliability league although i heard hyundai did make some giant strides before hyundai can reach honda toyota and nissan in quality they should be able to surpass mazda subaru and mitsubishi aside from mitsu which i think it is absolute junk hyundai has not gone past mazda or subaru speedracer3 only time will tell mazda mitsu and subaru are 2ndtier players in their home market behind market leaders toyota and nissan hyundai which also owns kia at least dominates its home market and hyundais sales in usa have exploded dont they outsell the mazda mitsu and subarau in usa hyundai is expanding production in usa and europe and hyundai is not part of some other automotive companys corporate empire eg mazdaford if any car maker can do it hyundai can hyundai heavy industries is the worlds largest shipbuilder  a title they took away from the japanese many years ago in fact they lead the world in shipbuilding technology my guess is that ifwhen hyundai the car company decides to launch a luxury car brand they will no doubt become serious competitorshowever long it takes i agree that near luxury cars have to offer some type of performance i think that the es330 competes closely with a mb 240320 but not with a bmw 325330 is300 g35 etc the kia amanti is an ugly looking car with a wealth of standard luxuries but of course its not a performance car even if hyundai puts a 35l v6 with 250hp and 240 torque in a sonata what about the tranny braking suspension etc and all of those other important components that keep that power in check i do not think that hyundai is up to that level of performance yet i traded in a 2002 sonata v6 for a mitsu gts only because i wanted a family size car with above average performance i agree that a separate luxury division would be better for hyundaikia because there would be a stigma who would pay 30k for an entry level luxury korean car when you can buy a loaded accordcamryaltimagalant6 etc as long as they dont go under trying if a company cant even build small reliable cars yet start making public statements about investing heavily in bringing out a luxury performance platform id dump their stock i also wouldnt be surprised if credit dried up as lenders lose confidance will hyundai be another daewoo  hyundai is a large company and they probable can afford building new engine trany and suspension but why the only reason honda and toyota were successful because of their reliability which was way better than any competition hyundai on the other hand have only average reliability its got better in a past but it takes years to build a name it took nissaninfiniti more than 10 years to come up with vehicles worth considering luxury not to mention they almost ran out of business and were bought by renoult hyundai may be have enof money to try  but kia will go under in no time no one is saying that hyundai is going to stir things up in the entrylevel luxury market any time soon give em some time they probable can afford building new engine trany and suspension but with below average reliability so the only reason to buy hyundai would be price certainly not reliability luxury or performance it isnt impossible for hyundai to become a serious competitor in the entrylevelluxury market to me hyundai is the most aggressive car manufacturer the problem is market leaders like toyota and honda always make innovations and enhancements too they just dont stand still they can be beaten if their product became overpriced lack of innovationenhancement they probable can afford building new engine trany and suspension but with below average reliability so the only reason to buy hyundai would be price theyve greatly improved on the reliability area httpwwwusatodaycommoneyautos20030311crpicks_xhtm tied with honda for 2002 models of course their older models are average or belowaverage of course still imitates other designs hey but who doesnt httphyundaifansproboards26comindexcgiboardnewsonata actiondisplaynum1081522745 looks like an a6 mated with an accord your statement hyundai  below average reliability is only true about what most people think the fact is that hyundai reliability is in the average to good range according to cr half of their models are recommended by cr whereas none of the mb or audi models are recommended because of reliability issues not that im comparing them remember toyota honda and datsun in the early years would you have bought one of those cars hyundai certainly deserves a lot more credit than what most people give the company and if they play their cards right they have a very bright future ahead of them will that future include a luxury brand who knows to some who cares i just find it very interesting to see how a car company slowly and deliberately improves their products and increases their market share it may be a little like watching a flower grow but one day it will bloom d power and associates a marketing and research firm said its annual initial quality survey which looks at problems in the first 90 days of ownership put hyundais 2002 vehicles below the industry average i am a little surprised that they rank them near the top next to honda says brian walters powers director of product research but i am not surprised to hear that hyundai products are getting better im also surprised 2 hear that they rank near honda in fact since im not a public figure being quoted in a well circulated broadsheet i would go s far s 2 say that ranking hyundai as above average cals into question the credibility of their ranking process possible yes probably no i would say its more probably that hyundai will b a footnote like daewoo then it will b a serious auto player let alone n auto player with n offering in the entry level luxury sedan market toyota and honda have no offerings in the entry level luxury sedan market even their luxury brands r still not 100 accepted and they constantly have 2 offer significantly more for less price 2 compete with the likes of mb and bmw  least they can say they have great reliability and lower maintenance costs what has hyundai got 2 offer  i remember toyota honda and datsun from the early days they didnt even try 2 enter this end of the market till 20 years later after dominating the mainstream car segment part of the reason they could survive those early years was the lack of competition and the unique circumstance of having oil price rise suddenly those 2 pre conditions for survival no longer exists as to hyundai  below average reliability i think thats fairly well accepted and what most people think very few people will actually accpet that hyundai have japanese car reliability until they really start to see 10 year old hyundais still trouble free and on our roads that may yet happen but not for another 10 years or so may be longer in the meanwhile will hyundai run out of money  check out jdpowerscom for initial quality ratings for 2003 mechanical quality\\naccord 3\\ncamry 3\\nsonata 4 feature and

5th\\nhyundai 31st\\nkia 37th re vdi 2003 rankings that study surveys cars that are 3 years old not 2003 models we all know that hyundais from that time are not up to par in reliability but by most indications hyundais have made great strides in the reliability department httpwwwconsumerreportsorgmaincontentdisplay_reportjspfo  lder3c3efolder_id402631assortment3c3east_id389451  bmuid1078916491036 i do agree with you that many people such as yourself still perceive hyundais as trouble prone cars also the jury is still out on the longterm reliability of these vehicles a 10 year warranty has all but eliminated past concerns from the original excel era the warrantys are nearly costless according to insiders as there is no tranferability and most people wont keep the car for more than 4 years thier repuation is much improved and with us and japanse investements in huyundia they will only get better they werent around in 1980 here in us and are now 3rd largerst carmaker i believe and sell more than chrysler here at home my 02 aggressive tqm coupled with very low total costs of operation spell success for hyundai they will not target premium brands until after they have big market share on volume niches like compact and mid size family sedan the biggest wild card i see is their politics could fowl up the whole plan made great strides their cars are a lot better than what they were just a few years ago they still have a ways to go before they catch up with the big 3 japanese manufacturers my biggest beef with hyundai is that their designs are derivative and not very original i see jaguar and mercedes in some the new tibby rips from ferrari i guess if you are going to copy do it from the best the biggest wild card i see is their politics could fowl up the whole plan what does that mean north korea nuclear ambitions will remain a drag on south koreas sovereign credit ratings check moodys rating over past few years roller coaster anyone i did not mean the companies politics per say profuse apologies for any confusions ontopic g35 rocks s koreas credit ratings had little to do with n korea their problem was that they tied up too much capital in unproductive conglomerates whose roi was awful because they were not run by real businessmen but well connected people who were able to obtain interest free government loans and guarantees which basically encouraged rampant overexpansion and covered up their mistakes for example the south korean domestic car industry is large enough to support only 1 maybe 2 domestic manufacturers instead s korea had hyundai kia daewoo and for a brief time samsung it is insane that korea had 4 major manufacturers when germany can support only 2 and the us had 3 until recently now that hyundai is the only major car manufacturer in korea and doesnt have to worry about insane competition in its home market they can focus on building better product personally i cant see hyundai entering the luxury market until they can compete on a level playing field with toyota honda and nissan in terms of quality and reputation when the big 3 of japan made their move into luxury what made it possible was the fact that they had cemented their reputations as building solid reliable cars until hyundai acquires that bulletproof rep i cant see people associating hyundai with that luxury brand image otoh if hyundai keeps up the good work it wont necessarily take long look how fast ghosn turned around nissaninfinit until hyundai acquires that bulletproof rep i cant see people associating hyundai with that luxury brand image back in 1986 honda did not exactly have a bulletproof reputation nor could most people associate honda with a luxury brand image yet they did the unthinkable and launched a luxury car brandacura five years later in 1991 the legend coupe won motor trends prestigious import car of the year trophy the same year the integra took the laurels as one of car  drivers ten best the integra would continue to make the ten best list in four of the next ten years the legend coupe won the title twice kinda makes you think dont it not disagreeing with any of your points if hyundai makes a great car at a great price yes perhaps they could compete but there are several factors working against that first the competition now is much more intense than ever before cadillac is producing nice cars chrysler is coming out with interesting product the nonpermissible content removed big 3 are in the game now and though mb and bmw have stumbled theyre still major players what worked back then wont necessarily work now second i dont know hyundais cash situation but i dont think its as good as honda or toyota when they launched their luxury brands in any case i dont think hyundai belongs in this thread since they are not yet considered luxury hopefully hyundai will follow the path of the japanese more quality cars choices and competition can only benefit consumers what will be interesting is what happens when the chinese come up with their own car brands and start entering the world market folks we are getting pretty far away from discussing the vehicles in our selfdefined category all good points saugatak thanks thanks to everyone for their interesting and insightful comments on the subject now to move ontls hot  back in 1986 honda did not exactly have a bulletproof reputation nor could most people associate honda with a luxury brand image yet they did the unthinkable and launched a luxury car brandacura five years later in 1991 the legend coupe won motor trends prestigious import car of the year trophy the same year the integra took the laurels as one of car  drivers ten best the integra would continue to make the ten best list in four of the next ten years the legend coupe won the title twice \\nwhen did honda launch a luxury brand theyve got a tweener brand and to whom is any award from mt or cd prestigous like all industry awards in every industry these things are bought either outright or through more round about means mt car of the year is most often a death knell for a vehicle the g35 is one of the few coty winners that wasnt a bust good answer i agree with you just look at the rl wasnt the k car car of the year subaru with the new legacy is on the cusp of premium  near luxury right now we are only waiting for the official pronouncements from the media to validate this this is not even considering the premium subaru 7 pass that is in the works now to true entry level luxury performance sedans here is the hirsch aero stuff httpwwwsaabperformancecom saab 95 aero takes off with a hirsch performance package already known for its responsive performance contemporary design and worldclass safety the sporty saab 95 aero

305 hp the torque also rises from 258 to 309 lbsft these numbers would provide the saab 95 aero with 133 horsepower per liter of displacement  a feat unmatched not only by other luxury sports sedans and wagons but also unmatched by most sports cars other enhancements include a full sports exhaust system including dual tailpipes performance brakes a lowered chassis with sporttuned suspension and

aero kicking the old rl is a cheapshot    nobody defends the old rl but the new rl looks pretty nice and if its shawd works as advertised with the 300 hp v6 best in class aside from insanely priced m3 and m5 i think the new rl will do pretty well and probably raise the prestige of the acura brand until acura incorporates shawd into their entire lineup theyre going to be considered a tweener brand bc like it or not luxury is now associated with rwd or awd some claim a v8 is necessary for lux as well but i dont agree with that because very few people elect v8s for their sedans even when available i would however like to see acura incorporate a v8 or ima or other torque boosting tech in their suvs which are in serious need of a low end torque boost however theres nothing wrong with tweener luxury brands i think its great that you can get a tl or g35 for approx 20k less than the equivalent bmw or mb im comparing 5 and c class here not 3 series bc its just too small i know there are fans of acura and infiniti who are annoyed with the mbbmwlexus snobbery but honestly is it really a good thing for the consumer if both acura and infiniti climb up the prestige ladder a la lexus what do i get out of that the right to pay more for the same car the feeling of superiority from the badge frankly im hoping that acura and infiniti continue to produce quality vehicles yet remain tweener brands if you race me in my tl or g35 narrowed down my choice to these 2 in your lexusbmwmb and i lose its because my wallet is so much heavier than yours its not even available here its like the kids babbling about the sti in 1998 yes 300 hp through the front wheels id rather a 300 hp rl thanks at least it can put the power down through the rear wheels too true i can work with this then httpwwwnordicsaabcomen_ushomepage_1chtml and the 300hp awd rl its not even available here its like the kids babbling about the sti in 1998 d the rl is not one of our subjects  in order to support the edmundscom site and the links from it to our discussions it has become very important that we at least mostly stick to the topic thats hard to do in a largely unfocused discussion such as this one i realize i think we are often getting into territory that would fit better in an opinion discussion on the news  views board rather than here on the sedans comparo board i have no investment in ending this conversation but if we are done comparing the subject vehicles pat mar 19 2004 634pm i really have to call the discussion done sorry i know this seems heavy handed but it is important that and it is my responsibility to ensure that the links from edmundscom into the sedans discussions take folks to conversations that the links represent i appreciate your understanding if you race me in my tl or g35 narrowed down my choice to these 2 in your lexusbmwmb and i lose its because my wallet is so much heavier than yours but thats my choice right its not about the finances its about the cars hey an evo can dust off all of these cars with change to spare and my wallet will still be heavier than yours it was an attempt at humor man maybe im not as funny as i thought maybe im not as funny as i thought nah youre funny just forgot the smiley at the end yhea cept the evo is not in the same class i test drove the automatic g35 coupe yesterday and was overwhelmingly impressed actually i was so impressed that i am going to be buying one as soon as i find the combo that i am looking for which is whitecharcoal with the premium areo  performance packages the manuatic was extremely smooth and actually a lot of fun to use i just love the power and how flat it stays in the corners the coupe is definitely one sweet ride so sweet that it will be the first slushbox that i have ever owned ill report back when i finally find the one im looking for i had a day off and was running errands in the dealers area so i drove a few of these highs and lows follow 93 aero\\nhighs fairly plushquiet

my test drive the engine noise in the 3 was the one impression i took away i thought it sounded unrefined and unnecessarily voluminous must be a matter of taste i suppose according to autosite supposedly the 325 is 68db70mph 73 wot the tsx is 67db70 74wot the tl 67  74 the 93 6874 c230 7288  different site  so aside from the c230 they ought to be indistinguishable in volume so i guess it depends on the timber and freqency youre used to i like how the 3 sounds but i know its taste i like how the old saab 20 sounds more than the new one and i think the xtype 30 sounds great  i question much of the rest of the car though  dave well im talking about engine sound coming through the firewall at 050 mph not the cabin noise level which includes roadtire and aerodynamic wind noise my test drive of the 325 was more suburban nonhighway constant startstopstart which is what i do most often i wanted a more refined sound environment what i heard was just somewhat better to what the 86 325 feels like now in 2004 so much for the 3 redesigns since then huh like it said it must be taste if its going to be 70db regardless id prefer more engine noise and less tire  wind noise i actually dont understand why someone would want otherwise they got criticized for making the engine too quiet so they livened it up there isnt even a muffler just a resonator they got criticized for making the engine too quiet so they livened it up there isnt even a muffler just a resonator \\ni hear or read often how people love the sound of inline 6s guess im the odd bimmer owner as i think the inline 6 in normal form sounds tinny and weak it lacks the growl of a vq imho thanks for posting those impressions  it must be fun to do them backtoback and it gives us input from someone who has handson info i owned an older saab i also found that the turbo whistled  i always thought there was a cop with siren on approaching from behind recently drove the 325 and found it as you said particularly very pricey as i wanted it your mission should you choose to accept it\\ntake another day off drive a g35 audi a6 cadillac cts post i wish my boss gave me projects like you do id like to drive them time is the issue i think neither is very fuel efficient ive driven the cts and thought it was allright but wasnt a big fan of the interior and the degree of isolation  as in engine too quiet  on my old 900 you could only hear the turbo whistle if you rolled the windows down and listened for it nothing ive driven so far makes me want to spend a lot of money to get out of my car i think ill wait until theres an ecocar that tickles my fancy dave yes i test drove the manual a couple of months ago i was not impressed with the notchy gates and extreme vibration that i felt through the stick  high rpms imo it just felt unrefined like i said before i have only owned manual transmissions volvo saturn bmw honda 2 vws  my current benz but either im getting old or lazy or maybe its my new baby boy causing more distraction in the car not to mention more traffic than ever in our capital city richmond va but i felt it was time to give the automatic a try i love the engine styling and incredible drive of the g35 coupe so much that i figured if the slushbox didnt disappoint and the manumatic feature wasnt just a gimmick that i would buy one i will still have my benz 6 speed for sunday afternoons without the family on board i was not impressed with the notchy gates and extreme vibration that i felt through the stick  high rpms imo it just felt unrefined i experienced the exact same phenomena when i test drove the g35 sedan 6mt a real turn off yep the tranny is definitely not as smooth as the bmw units i like that the g35 has a shorter throw than the bmws though i just bought a g35 sedan w6 speed took it through upstate ny this past weekend beautiful drive up around the finger lakes auburn and skaneteles sp area great roads i highly recommend if you146re within a few hours check the area out on to my new car this car is quick the broad torque and power curve give it tremendous flexibility i was able to pass comfortably in 6th gear starting around 40 mph most other cars ive owned would have required some downshifting when they say the 6 speed is close ratio they werent kidding my shifts generally resulted in only about 115k reduction in rpms through most of the gears i found myself starting off in 2nd going to 4th then on to 6th unless i wanted to rip and rip it does around corners its very stable and predictable i knew exactly what the car was doing direct link to the driver the bridgestone turanza all seasons leave a bit to be desired but what allseason doesnt the highway ride is good for a sporty car i would put it on par with my previous 2000 bmw 323 wsport suspension it was slightly more crusty than my previous 2003 accord ex v6 nvh levels fit somewhere between the two mentioned cars the seats favor a narrow backside glad i fit like a glove hvac is not intuitive but once set keeps constant temps cruise control also requires a bit more button punching than other vehicles ive had but again once set its steady eddie no complaints from the back seat occupants in fact my son remarked on the large sunroof opening that extends back far enough for back seat occupants to enjoy a bit of the view his center armrest was also put to good use for gameboys food drinks etc i really like the size of this vehicle as well slightly larger than my old bmw 3 series is300s mercedes c class and about the same size as the 5 series did i mention that in black the g35 sedan looks pretty darn good 25 mpg 34 highway 14 country roads with a few hammer down runs up around 130 mph  yep the tranny is definitely not as smooth as the bmw units i like that the g35 has a shorter throw than the bmws though to me the g35 tranny was better than the vague notchy binding junk bmw uses in its trannies neither car had honda smooth trannies but id rather the trucklike feel and vibration of the gs manual to the vwish junk bmw uses top seller of april 2004 for 30k38k sedan\\n1 acura tl 6711 units\\n2 lexus es 6460 units\\n3 bmw325i 3960 units  325xi 1423

chevy malibu isnt it strange how things work a sephia way better than a 911 turbo sure 3 big mac is much better than 192k porsche 20k malibu10k kia sephia of course better than 192k porsche are they at the same segment same price range same type of carsedan do people crossshop them if i need to eat will i buy a diamond instead of food lol same old logic try a new one  its a common knowledge that people compare burger to burger not burger to diamond maybe not in lala land eh  btw its only sales figures comparison dont be delusional its where the market makes its statement not you or me  doesnt bmw use gm tranniesi remember hearing that somewhere well sort of if im not mistaken bmw is eliminating or has eliminated the gm tranny from their lineup and is switching or has switched over to all zf gearboxes at least for the automatic transmissions what im unsure about is if they are still using the gm version in their awd 3series offerings which i believe iswas the last application of that transmission regarding the gm transmission it iswas not your run of the mill unit as is available here in the us on any old gm car this unit was built in a french factory and was not used for any cars sold in american except for maybe the now defunct catera best regards\\nshipo well im not the one repeating the same old volume argument desperate for salesfigure validation are they in the same segment maybe one might question if the honda tl is in the same segment as the bmws and if the 30 extra hp is worth the price premium over the accord a car that isnt next to you at every stop light that is one nice thing about the is300 nice car that isnt too common would be interesting to see the demographic breakdown of buyers age sex and income the age of the is300 average buyer is about 30 the lowest for all toyotalexus products even scion maybe in omaha ne the is 300 is not common here in s florida they are a dime a dozen then again so are bmws audis and everything else you can dream of one also might question if less hp is worth the price premium over the accord overpriced  posting a sales figure comparison doesnt need your vaildation aight the truth is out there lol according to our host pat and all magazines this cars are in the same segment if you think otherwise maybe you in the wrong thread would be interesting to see the demographic breakdown of buyers age sex and income the age of the is300 average buyer is about 30 the lowest for all toyotalexus products even scion its common in parts of southern california orange county is teeming with is300s driven by kids same with mira mesa ca orange county is teeming with is300s driven by kids same with mira mesa ca same here the is 300 is a teenager car around this part of the sunshine state the tl is a brand new redesign which is an improvement over its predecessor in more ways than one so it does not surprise me when the sales figures reflect significant volume in april get back to me in a year from now i only posted a sales figure comparison and i didnt make any statement at all dont be delusional its the markets statement that shows these car are going to the right direction i cant change the markets statement neither can you there is no overall better car one can value luxury more than performance while others dont and some prefer both even in performance dept alone it consist of acceleration cornering slalom etc none of these sedans has them all about getting back to you a year from now how about going back at time when your favourite car was new what was its highest record  i hope its apple versus apple not burger  im not entirely certain why someone is still so enamored with owning something popular i buy what i like and the world be damned apparently not all of us live for ourselves the whining back and forth about the sales volumes is really appealing not but the point that came through at the end is true all the cars in this segment are very good at doing what theyre made to do and selecting between them reflects more on the priorities of the buyer than the superiority of one car versus another the tl is selling well because it is currently fitting the priorities of more buyers with 3040 k to spend on a performance sedan than the others yes a big part of that is subjective new modelstyling buzz from good reviews but when you take a bunch of cars that all perform great its the subjective stuff that makes the difference i bought the tl because it performs great i never had a problem with torque steer for the information of those overly attached to rwd and in the end the styling and technology love the bluetooth were better than the rest especially for the  you guys pick what you like the world be damned but everyone else is buying what they like and a lot of us like the tl best a car that isnt next to you at every stop light\\nwho cares really some may i dont that is one nice thing about the is300 nice car that isnt too common\\nsales could be better since i dont play the more is necessarily better game i will only say if one adds up all of the 3 series sales in all engine sizes in all body styles it exceeds 6711 im always much more interested in reading how individuals feel about different characteristics of different vehicles than anything about sales figures ive never yet met one person in the town hall or anywhere else who bases a buying decision on number sold for any given vehicle why not just discuss our opinions of the merits and demerits of the cars in this class i find it hard to believe that any of you have really formed your opinons about these vehicles based on how many have been sold i heard acura didnt think mp3 was good enough and opted for dvda a format which doesnt really have much content maybe the other manufacturers are more attuned to the market most people dont have hdtv and only about 50 of the network content is now hd heck i dont even watch tv really arrested development anduh the nfl but i still bought hd if im gonna watch tv im gonna see it at its best if i were to record id buy an hd recorder i could record with a vcr the mp3 of video but i wouldnt want that kind of video quality likewise if i bought a tl id find dvda content because its far superior to cds far and mp3 forgetaboutitjunk your analogy doesnt make sense you are comparing two different things at two vastly different prices she is listing vehicles in the same class that are about the same price get a grip just a note on bmw using gm transmissions i had a 99 328i with a gm automatic and have to say it is the best automatic ive ever driven including the one in my g35x right now smooth to a fault quick to downshift always had the right gear selected and never gave me a bit of problems give gm credit where credit is duemy understanding is that their automatics are benchmarks for the rest of the automotive world it is my understanding that the gm built transmission in the 323i328i was actually a bmw design that gms french factory simply executed i cannot honestly say that ive ever heard gm being praised as having the benchmark automatic gearbox funny thing is that during the 1960s and 1970s it was gm paying chrysler royalties on quite a few of the parts in their turbohydro automatics of day go figure  best regards\\nshipo so then the f150 kicks all those cars asses has anyone here seen the june road and track comparo that theyre talking about on the cts board if so what cars were tested as usual everyone in america gets their magazines before me m i understand that its hard to know the difference between a truck and a sedan a horse and a pony an apple and an egg if they were on sale o 38000 0 to 60 in 55 seconds rt mentions 545i in the same breath 12000 cheaper than cts value equation pointed heavily in this direction seems like a winner to me go to the link below httpwwwwhatsnextblogcomarchives000254aspmore i already have an audi if i get a beemer next ill be set lol kinda gives new meaning to the term performance  im printing this out for my wife i think im getting screwed or not 7 cars all automatics all with mediocre tires mostly allseasons bmw 530i nonsport the most expensive as tested at 54000 the new chrysler 300 the least expensive around 34000 other cars included jag stype a6 e320 and s80 t6 the 43000 cts 36l wsport pkg won the comparison what do people with hundreds or thousands of cds do replace them with dvda discs assuming there is that much content on dvda most car stereo makers are supporting mp3s in one way or another they now support mp3 files on cds and the next thing will probably be support for the portable mp3 players which are selling like hotcakes whatever nuances which dvda may reproduce they would get lost in the noisy car environment meanwhile mp3s any any other lossy or lossless codecs will give you the convenience of having your entire library at once these oem makers should be embracing digital audio not being snobs about it is um interesting and fun but lets keep on topic here and leave it be the survey does relate to the brand of cars we are talking about more subjective reasons to buy a specifc brand i dont see the harm of discussing the article while we keep it clean and relate it to cars waddya say you do realize that the people with hundreds or thousands of cds can still play them in acuras dvda system right so there is no need to replace them with dvda  unless you want to what do people with hundreds or thousands of cds do replace them with dvda discs assuming there is that much content on dvda it still plays regular cds just as a dvd player at home will still play cds most car stereo makers are supporting mp3s in one way or another they now support mp3 files on cds and the next thing will probably be support for the portable mp3 players which are selling like hotcakes sure i can get a dension icelink for an ipod and fully control and recharge the system while listening to mp3s in my bmw so whatever nuances which dvda may reproduce they would get lost in the noisy car environment \\ni think the tl owners can refute that theres no comparing 51 sound to 2 channel stereo its like the leap from black and white to color tv really its just richer and filled with more detail but the same basic message is there heck id love to have a dts system in a car as the moment i see that acronym on dvd im excited the sound is much crisper than dolby 51 meanwhile mp3s any any other lossy or lossless codecs will give you the convenience of having your entire library at once thats convenient yep given the choice between stellar sound and quanity ill always choose quality these oem makers should be embracing digital audio not being snobs about it they are embracing technology  the best technology this reminds me of luddites crying about the shift to cds 15 years ago this reminds me of our local car reviewer in the paper from about 1993 until 2000 every time he tested a car with a cd player he would insert an opinion about how you couldnt appreciate the better sound quality in a car and that it was a waste of money over just a cassette player hello the reason for the cd player is because we have all these cds at home i guess he was converting all of his to cassette he was a really good reviewer otherwise but that used to drive me nuts so when does the a3 sportback come out i think i could use an audi lol the g35 has a tape deck i cant decide what to think about that this is a good thing i assume an indash cd also a lot of books on tape motivational tapes etc are only available on cassette i think having both is a bonus unless that is standard and cd is extra cost in that case never mind regards\\nkyfdx my 2003 audi a4 has a tape deck 2004 models no longer have tape decks only cd players i have a huge collection of tapes boy now i feel old every tape always plays not so for cds i use mine in my g to connect my sirius pnp wow havent owned a tape in 14 years someone mentiioned cds not working in the carah what do people do to their cds heard the same about dvds and video games again same question keep the cd in its case extract it put it in the player never leave it out or sitting on anything simple concept simple execution and simple way to keep cds going strong decades later actually there are some studies on cd rot its a very real thing that can effect cds over time the effects can be mitigated by using good cds but the study implied you cannot rely on cds being there year after year actually if yall didnt know the top side of the cd which has the aluminum is more suseptable to scratching than the underside if the aluminum is scratched the cd will be rendered unreadable wowwhat a timely topic kd you must have the same article in the paper today as we did i learned a lot that i didnt know especially about the top side being the easiest to damage i think most people have problems with cdrw that they have burned cdr usually give much less trouble regards\\nkyfdx i have a friend who was looking for the pin holes 10 years ago when wed go to music trader all the cds i got as a teen still work guess ive been lucky nothing really new in this segment right now i guess the 2005 g35 redo will stir things up slightly then the segment will get a significant jolt with the new bmw 3 and lexus is next year how does cd hold up in a closed car in the middle of summer there used to be a brand of blank cassettes with the casing made of lexan to withstand heat in a mobile environment never have problems reading cds but dvds might be problematic on some cheap dvd players tapes of course tend to jam and get eaten up by poor mechanisms not to mention all the oxide flakes from the tape gumming up the tape playback heads and rollers over time that is why some people can laugh at mp3 but flash media and hard disk should be fairly durable not to mention not having to swap out media because you can have a large collection at one time they better come correct with the new is or theyre going to get hammered dealerships cant give the current version away theyre selling less than 1000 unit a month nationwide probably at cost if the 3 series gets the same exterior treatment as the rest of the bmws acura and infiniti are going to run away with the market there are plenty of rumblings that bmw wont be so foolish as to let the next gen 3series follow in the footsteps of the 5  7 series cars from all of the spy photos that ive seen so far the car looks good and restrained with no banglization apparent so far at least that gives me hope because when the e60 5series was this far along its horrid looks were already quite obvious so assuming that bmw builds a nice looking car they seem to have a number of technical goodies waiting in the wings that will make the car more than competitive with what will then be on the market time will tell best regards\\nshipo when will it be released 20052006 they raised the price if a 530 by 7k or somthing and they are selling like hotcakes  whats the price increase expected to be on an already 40k loaded car man this thing could be 50 loaded for 430i  selling like hot cakes ummm not from where i sit yes the 5series numbers are about 15 higher than last year as a whole the 530i is only up by about 1 but so what last years numbers were depressed because the e60 was waiting in the wings my bet is that when the new car bubble is fully deflated the e60 will be relegated to the status of mediocrity by the market and by automotive historians best regards\\nshipo 2channel vs 51 or dts true audiophiles listen to 2 channel stereo systems 51 or dts are for movies or listening to concert music pure clear music can be achieved the most on 2 channel systems thats a fact now some people specially in home systems listen to regular cds on 51 or 61 bec it makes them feel like theyre in a theater or a concert hall sound bounces  echoesif youre into clean  natural sound 2 channel is still the best 2channel vs 51 or dts true audiophiles listen to 2 channel stereo systems 51 or dts are for movies or listening to concert music pure clear music can be achieved the most on 2 channel systems thats a fact now some people specially in home systems listen to regular cds on 51 or 61 bec it makes them feel like theyre in a theater or a concert hall sound bounces  echoesif youre into clean  natural sound 2 channel is still the best the whole point of dvda is to put you in the center of the music cant be done with 2 channel and someone mentioned the 5 seriessales are way up on 5 series so i think regardless of how people are grumbling about the looks its still selling strongly the much maligned 7 is selling strongly too now that horrid x3 bmw cant give that thing away or the z4 this is just rumor gleaned from following other bmw forums in germany there may be new e90s hitting the road this november or december but any major production would be after the first of the year for na out sometime in 2005 but as an 06 model ive heard everything from april to october with the consensus being toward the latter end of that time frame no facts here though regards\\nkyfdx thanks for the info wife has announced she wants a 3 series for her next car and her current lease is up at the end of 2005 would rather go with the new iteration if not bangled from the spy shots ive seen you can see the bangle influences but not in the rear which to me is the only thing that really bothers me about his designs think x3 for the front end and a cross between the x3 and the e60 5series for the side view my only concern is that it is supposedly growing in size which would be great if you lean toward a 5series but not so great if you want something smaller regards\\nkyfdx from these spyshots it doesnt look half bad then again you can only tell when you see it in person httpwwwmodernracercomspyshotsspyshotshtml i like it but you never know how true those pictures are the 1series however those are actual shots i like that a lot also ive found that almost all of the new designs grow on me after i get used to seeing them even the 7 doesnt bother me like it used to regards\\nkyfdx anyone see that goofy looking subbie they are going to be killing the die hards with a 33k loaded stickerawful but loaded with goodies amazing how all the cars cost the same based on content regardless of some other major considerations  like a 4 cylinder is still a 4 cylinder and a drivetrain thatsnot better than an accord should not be more expensive than 1 33k this is the third time today that i have felt the need to challenge the assertion that the new e60 5series sales numbers are up up from what last year when the whole world knew that a new model was coming out and folks were waiting for the new car last year when 5series sales were way down from 2002 while i dont have the numbers available im betting that if one was to compare the 2004 sales numbers to the 2002 numbers ytd that youd find that the numbers for the new e60 are if anything down furthermore my bet is that they will continue to go down even more best regards\\nshipo to each his own id probably consider a current 5  but i wouldnt have touched anything but the last gen m5 in the 5 series we all have different things we like and i never said sales were up visavis 2002 only up  which is the current spin if they go down i dont much care if bmw stops selling cars i simply wont be able to look at them when my lease is up i have no vested interest  emotional or financial  in the success of any company should bmw join audivw as a laughingstock so be it i have other options fjm1 you have to keep in mind that lexus has the es330 and is300 overlapping price points since the es is based on the popular camry guessing its profit per unit when calculated in dollars is actually higher though the is is based on the altezza lexus hardly advertises the is lexus dealers pushing the es their perennial best selling car and suvs over half of lexus sales are suvs the june 2004 issue of motor trend p 44 has an interesting sales chart labelled nearluxury segment sales bmw 3 series is 12 the es330 is 13 the is300 is 31 mb cclass is 3 g35 is 19 while the i35 is 39 a4 is 3 jag xtype is 10 saab 93 is 27 i myself wouldnt get another 3series until i know where bmw is taking that lineup with rumors of a 35l that could be my next vehicle of course well have to see if bmw pushes xdrive downstream to the 3series and gets rid of their current awd setup i think a lot of people are waiting including myself not for the redesign of the exteriorinterior which i like on all models but the bumpup of hptorque under the hood bmw needs to go back to basics which are all around competent vehicles with class leading hp and a dash of valvetronic technology thrown in for good measure i can take or leave idrive for example but they have to be more than the underpowered gold standard not to take this too off topic but since we are discussing the audio sytstems in comparable vehicles stereo 2 channel is and probably will always be the audiophiles choice music reproduction is not about being in the center of it having played orchestral brass for many years you do not want to sit in the center of music i dont think you would care either for the way a rock band sounds from between the singer and the drum kit music reproduction is about creating a sound stage that accurately reflects the original true source when you go to the concert whether it is classical or rock the sound starts in front of you there are no speakers at the rear room dynamics will bounce sound all over the place and these diffractions generally speaking should be avoided 51 is what hollywood uses and for that purpose movies it probably is best top gun with the planes flying front to back is best created by 51 52 or what are they now talking about 62 with a speaker overhead or something it is a fact that dvda sounds much better than cd so from that standpoint the acura has a big advantage we may see some manufacture going for the better still sacd but i have not heard anything yet if any of you are ever in las vegas in january they have the annual audiophile manufactures convention they have dozens of rooms with some systems costing upwards of 100000\\n95 of the rooms are 2channel stereo and most of those rooms use analogue records not digital sources bmw sold 4400 5 series last month and mb sold 5000 eclass pretty good for both companies but you gotta remember that buyers in this segment are pretty much limited to these two cars right now with the gs a6 rl m and sts in their last model year the story will change once these cars come out at almost the same time and all of them seem much improved from the previous version i still expect the e and the 5 to be the sales leaders but the other cars will undoubtely take quite a bit of sales away here is the article on the latest nbrs from thr national post\\nregards\\nwebby\\nhttpwwwcanadacomsearchstoryhtmlid4d62a948b3ef47ff807 53fbf06601bb5 i think if you look at that listand percentages up and down they seem directly related to how new that model is the newer models seem to be up and the ones farther along in their life cycle seem to be down but im with blueguy i could care less overall how sales are if it is a car im interested in i hope they are way down that should help my price regards\\nkyfdx personally i do not care for the current 325i i think the options are outrageously priced and the car is underpowered for what you are paying but my wife seems to want one so she gets what she wants that guarantees that ill get what i want on when its my turn i didnt see any relevant numbers in that article the numbers that im looking for are 2004 vs 2002 as anything compared to 2003 are essentially irrelevant because by then the e39 5series sales were on the decline best regards\\nshipo i see you logic but it is always a good start is to deal with real available numbers rather assumptions guessing feelings and predictions\\nregards\\nwebby i have the real 2004 vs 2003 numbers and they are underwhelming at best only the 545i shows a significant increase above the e39 540i i also have a fairly good memory and last year the e39 numbers were down substantially versus 2002 hence my assertion that the new e60 is something of a dud compared to the e39 best regards\\nshipo i have to say the pricing info you are giving is misleading first you are comparing it with a coupe g35 and everybody knows that the coupes are i priced higher ii considered more rare and thus unlikely to get any discounts since the acura is a sedan you should compare with the g35 sedan on top of everything you are comparing with the g35 manual transmission coupe which is the rarest and highest performing g35 version it is harder to get discounts on that car  usually each dealership only has one of them and is not worried about being able to sell it also you obviously preferred the accura which means you did not bargin for a better price for the infiniti if you compare a g35 sedan with a tl sedan the bargained for prices should be about the same i would still recomend the tl for laydi because it seems that she prefers features rather than performance and the tl does seem to have a couple of more features such as voice recognition on the navigation bluetooth etc my bmw was for my wife as well i happen to really like the 3series though i agree that it is overpriced as is almost every bmw im not sure i agree with underpowered though if you are comparing a powerprice ratio then yes but i think the car has plenty of power for its size and mission im not sure ill get what i want ever again so i got her car the way i would have wanted it sport package she could care less but does like the seats hk stereo she never cranks it xenons i also bought m68s off a 330i so i could keep the winter tires on her stock style 96s unfortunately she doesnt drive a stick but it is her car after all so i keep driving my honda and play with hers on the weekend what are you getting next time regards\\nkyfdx i have no clue what i will be getting next time i got another 3 years to go on my a4 lease plenty of time to see what new and exciting toys come out in the meantime if i do get her a beemer ill make sure it has some of the things i would want in a car like sport package maybe even smg she also likes the new volvo s40 a lot lets see what happens this topic has played itself out pretty well but some new iron is on the horizon that might shake up this class im speaking of the 20045 volvo s40 t5 and more significantly the upcoming 2005 subaru legacy 25gt limited httpwwwneeddesirecommainhtml these two cars are knoking on the door of this segment will they be admitted to the club i think the volvo may be closer than the subaru i am very interested in the new legacy but it is more sport than luxury and may not even be near luxury no steering wheel audio controls i know the is300 does not either early rumours were the legacy would not have a remote trunk release the ride on the gt is going to be firmer than luxury the gt has a bunch of quality thrown at it but they did not try to hard to convey an image of luxury they are most certainly going for the sport crowd with 250 lbft of torque and lightened body panels the gt may be my next car but i am getting it for the driving dynamics and not the cush i currently drive an 02 mb c240 which is slow but very quiet and has near luxury features i have a 2002 altima and ready to trade up after reading these boards i took a 330ix stick for a test drive today and i dont understand all the praise a stiff ride all 330 have sport suspension acording to the sales guy like that may be good for the track but it beats you up on new england roads yes the handling was tight but i didnt feel a strong connection with the road the shifting was not overly smooth and it had the pickup of a 2001 maxima i felt the interior was very plain i was really disappointed first a correction not all 330 sedans have the sport suspension the 330i has the sport suspension the 330xi has the standard suspension relative to the stiff ride i guess its all a matter of personal taste the suspension on the 330xi that you drove is the exact same suspension that i had on my 1999 328i and if anything it was too soft as such i ordered the sport package on my next bmw and once again if anything its too soft oh and by the way i live in new england regarding not feeling connected to the road well with the standard 20550 r17 allseason tires that the xi comes with im not too surprised if you want to feel connected to the road drive a 330i with the sport package sp or better yet drive the 330i with the performance package zhp fwiw the sp will only make a marginal compromise in the ride of the car while improving the handling considerably the zhp will magnify that compromiseimprovement considerably more regarding the interior yes bmws do typically have simple and very functional interiors some of us like them some folks dont the good news is that there is plenty of competition in that segment these days and you wont have to look too much further a field to find something that suits you better best regards\\nshipo altima 25 doesnt sound like you have the 35 se as thats pretty well known for having a bone jarring ride the interior is plain those who live in glasses houses as for harsh huh i find my zhp too soft guess thats why they make so many brands of cars one mans harsh your view of the 330i is another mans mildly sport my view of a standard 330i the upcoming legacy was brought up a while back and consequently disallowed by the host cwbarrett i hear yah fwiw i echo the previous statements if your going in search of the bmw soul a 330ix isnt going to show you what driving enthusiasts rave about as for whats all the fuss it can be hard to spot the value added quotient for bmws lies in the details it takes a sharp eye to spot some of the overengineering that goes into most bmws from great paint that will last the life of the car to premium tires on many of the sport models and seats that are an ergonomic marvel it all adds up dont get me wrong i still think theyre overpriced and unreliable but i can see and more importantly feel why others choose to own these fine driving machines legacy was passed over because its a subaru how many times are we going to have to go over this you can make a 100k subaru but its still a subaru and thus not part of a luxury brand relax nobody was arguing yet i was just informing fedlawman of a past decision you can make a 100k subaru but its still a subaru and thus not part of a luxury brand go ahead snub your nose even the porsche crowd is fuming that sti and evo performance is comparable to a 911 carrera and the sti can beat the m3 you guys who want to see subaru included here forget it too much pedantic thinking you will need a good lawyer sympathetic judge and probably an amendment to the us constitution for this to happen ridiculous i see blues point here nobody is questioning subarus prowess to build sport sedans they are great little cars that deliver incredible performace for the buck no question i think the difference is that subaru is not a luxury car manufacturer the sti and evo are both rally cars they the farthest thing from what we are talking about here entrylevel luxury sedans when saab rebadges the subaru then we can talk about it not a millisecond before  is the saab line considered part of this discussion 93 or 95 in nearly every thread around here there is a wide tolerance for digression it makes for stimulating uninhibited conversation its one thing when forum hosts get involved because this is a privately owned place and it is their prerogative but getting tossed by another poster for questionable reasons is out of line as far as i am concerned if a car doesnt fall within the topic but compares to these cars it should be discussed by default its only normal and natural furthermore theres the letter of the law and the spirit of the law and since this place is not a court of law i think it would be better to adhere to the latter i you go back and read you will find that the host did step in i dont like it either but must abide by it nonetheless pats stepped in already the scoobie is just that a scoobie not a luxury brand and yeah an sti is blisteringly fast sos a mustang svt neither are luxury cars neither belong in a legit comparo of luxury brands if you think there should be a bang for the buck comparo discussion based on performance cars ranging from 3045k open that discussion then you can toss in the s2000 sti ctsv m3 mustang etc etc entry level luxury performance sedans have been defined the scoobie isnt one heck if i wanted just performance id buy a 23k wrx and mod it like my brotherinlaws bro hes got over 350 hp pumping through that ratty tin can econobox when saab rebadges the subaru then we can talk already done httpwwwmptorgmotorweekreviewsrt2336shtml we already decided what were talking about in this particular discussion  if we dont draw the line somewhere we end up spending too much time talking about what should or should not be included everything is explained here pat mar 19 2004 634pm please lets not go through all of that all over again  what do we do if bmw decides to rebadge a subaru just to keep up o im surprised as i thought everyone would rag on the subaru as a gm rebadge but ive seen some positive articles claiming the interior changes were very positive id have liked it better had they switched to the saab engine out of all the cars ive driven in this topic i still think i like the 95 the best as an overall priceotd price with rebates etc package deal it seems that the cts did really well in the last road and track issue dave kahunah dont forget that bmw makes the mini which includes the cooper s dont think the mini belongs on this forum but a heck of an interesting car thanks for the feedback and correction of what i was told ill try another test drive with a different set of options i know im looking at a serious trade up from my altima its a pos hopefully ill find something comfortable and fun for my 40 mile commute ive seen nothing but positive stuff on the 92 heck it addressed some things i dislike about the wrx  the cheap interior the lack of sound deadening hey i like some elements of luxury for my money not to mention that this wrx is ugly looks like a car designed in the early 70s not to mention that this wrx is ugly looks like a car designed in the early 70s hey watch it bub i think my 1970 chevy vega was way better looking than the wrx  best regards\\nshipo sorry i brought it up i remember the discussion we had and the ultimate exclusion of the brand which i basically agree withbut that was before i saw a preview of the car the interior and exterior are entrylux elegant and 250 hp  awd make it a very compelling car i think that the new legacy is going to be a difficult car to define anyways sorry i wont mention it again not to mention that this wrx is ugly looks like a car designed in the early 70s \\ni dont much care what a car looks like on the outside bad exterior design wont impact my decision to buy i drive from inside the car not sure how you guys do it ive been a fan of the bmw and porsche look particularly the latter for 30 years subtle shape and details clean lines minimalism to me styling is a big part of the total package now that bmw has gone to the fruitcake look i will not buy another one even though they are without doubt the ultimate driving sedans i can live with boring but ugly crosses over my tolerance threshold am watching tl and rl closely the styling is cleancut and shawd has my attention but thats in the sedan category sports cars are another story for instance i would never buy a yellow sedan but it works on the two seaters so do orange purple and chartreuse i am also a fan of the kiddie cars aka boy racers i know some people loathe them but i think they show energy and youthful panache wouldnt mind doin up an m3 the ultimate kiddie car in purple with yellow and orange flames make that an e39 m5 love ridiculous street cars  i dont care how impressive the car is on the track if i view the exterior andor interior as ugly than you will not see it in my driveway as i have previously stated the cts does not appeal to me in the very least but i would drive it without being embarrassed i can not say the same for the wrx\\njust my opinion the looks of the wrx dont bother me that much im not in love with it and i would have to have the wagon if i got one though my problem is the inside i keep thinking it would be worth 24k with all that power on tap but then i get in and there is no way i think saab could have a winner with the 92 what with wrx performance and hopefully an improved interior and more luxury options not that the wrx isnt already successful on its own regards\\nkyfdx what bothers me about the wrx evo even the is300 is that boyracer look i am in my mid 30s with young kids and i have outgrown the my car can beat you in a race attitude i want a car with nice classic lines that looks good is moderately luxurious and has a good mix of performance and utility if i was single and in my twenties the abovementioned cars would probably fix my lifestyle better i am in my mid 30s with young kids and i have outgrown the my car can beat you in a race attitude yeah i hear you i went through that phase too good fathers with young kids are doing what they are supposed tofathering youve probably got a way to go before the midlife crisis but trust me if sporty cars figured in your life or mind early they will again and if your handle is any indication i guarandamntee you they will  oh i plan to have a big crisis once the kids are grown i plan to have totally impractical cars that have no other purpose than to amuse my right foot when i have my crisis i will only look at sport cars and coupes i am there right now got myself a 330ci coupe with performance package and smg does it suppose to make you feel better i still feel as lost as before being lost me too but im as happy as a clam when im driving my car i am going through the luxury sport coupe phase right now i turned in 1 coupe last year and picked up another my wife and i have no kids so i will take advantage for now now if i were single i might look at a pure sports car like the corvette no wait a minute single  more  lets take a look at the porsche 911 turbo instead i am in my mid 30s with young kids and i have outgrown the my car can beat you in a race attitude yeah i hear you i went through that phase too good fathers with young kids are doing what they are supposed tofathering i guess im a bad father my cave dweller black g35 sedan w6 speed and sport suspension doesnt give up much to a 350z wait a minutethis isnt a bad influence on my sonim teaching him you can have your cake and eat it too mmmmmm cakehomer drools what are you guys tooling around in minivans am there right now got myself a 330ci coupe with performance package and smg does it suppose to make you feel better i still feel as lost as before just think how much faster you can get lost if you get lost in my neck of the woods id be glad to help you find your way now give me the keys i guess im a bad father now now thats not what i said when the old man rides around in a new vette and the kids are walkin around barefootthats a bad father  would i make junior go barefoot for a new vette hmmmm i live in kentucky my kids are supposed to be barefoot naw got rid of the minivan long time ago i hate them almost as much as suvs we just stick to sedans now hmmm i guess that since minivans are in such ill favor i must be a bad father we have not one but two caravans oh and a 530i 5speed sp as well  best regards\\nshipo i must be a really bad person i just got a new ody van for hauling and towing makes driving my boy racer is300 sportcross even more fun nothing like jumping between a good handling rwd car and a 4300 lbs fwd bread box with really greasy tires if the thing isnt under steering you have probably already lost control going to upgrade wheels and tire next week to see if i can get a little more lateral grip youve all been bad really bad involves two trained monkeys chocolate syrup and a spatula jmess i remember an article last year by a magazine called grassroots motorsports good mag\\njust for giggles they did a full track session with a couple of vintage porsches vs the tow vehicle you guessed it the tow vehicle was a honda ody and it lapped competitively with the porsches the bar just keeps getting higher 10 years ago the only sedan that could run like my g35 had an m on the tail now weve got tl is 3ers going like stink and the ms amgs and the new maserati are light years beyond that its a great time to be an enthusiast hope gas prices dont put the kaibosh on it my car get terrible mileage i dont think rising gas prices is going to have a major impact look at the cl and sl65 amg most powerful production mbs ever they make a 400hp m5 look like your grandmas buick century then theres the buggatti the bentley gt maserati mc12 etc its funny to think that cars like the charger cuda 442 etc could be embarrased by todays acura tls now all i need is a hybrid shawd acura rl pushing 350400hp toyota and hondas technology has the potential to majorly shake up the performance industry i think theres rumors of an awd lexus gs350gt with 470hp getting 40mpg now that is having ones cake and eating it too hope gas prices dont put the kaibosh on it my car get terrible mileage huh i just drove to vegas this week in my bimmer running an average of 90 but more realistically over 90 as i had to fight traffic to get out of san diego at 5pm i got 26 mpg that was including one segment of about 70 miles at over 100 mph and occasional bursts to over 120 26 mpg isnt too shabby coming home as it was day and traffic was thicker i still averaged 80 and got 30 mpg i couldnt do that with my econobox commuter when i was in europe taking delivery of my ed 530i and once the car had traversed the requisite 1200 breakin miles i found that it would get 24 mpg at  125 mph like you said not too shabby  best regards\\nshipo sheesh what radar detector do u use a 442 would dust a tl on the drag strip along with most of the other cars including an m5 maybe not on a slolam but i dont drive around cones as a normal course but i agree it doesnt have an iota of luxury the sl65amg is not 70k either it is a super high performance 2 seater vehicle costing many more bucks than an m5 without the option of a stick shift the cars are in different leagues it may compare favorably with the new m5 though i have a valentine one the directional arrows make it tough to beat um what are you talking about i didnt mean heavily modded blown 442s im talking about the original cars youre seriously trying to tell me it would outrun an m5 i dont remember any car from any country in the 60s and 70s including the ac cobra pulling 4 second 060s not with carbs and 4000lbs of steel i didnt mean heavily modded blown 442s those are the only ones i remember vividly point is you made a blanket statement that i dont believe was quite accurate you cant even heavily mod a tl because it would shred the trannytires or engine want to get to 60 in 57 how many dropclutch starts does it take before the clutch is burnt out on these modded cars you could dropclutch all day and the dang things would yawn spent my college years ogling them tried every trick in the book to get my father to spring or lend me the money for one that was one cool sled shortly after i learned about the 2002 and handling when my brother came home with one after that life wasnt the same now we can have a car that posts respectable numbers in alot more categories than just 060 wish my g35 got mileage like the above bimmer posts 21 mpg in mostly rural driving didnt the 70s have a fuel crisis that brought the muscle car era to a screaching halt thats what im hoping isnt going to happen now it wasnt the fuel crisis so much as it was the smog equipment they had the technology to clean up the exhaust but only at the expense of performance i had a 77 mustang with a 302 v8 135 horsepower two barrel carb gobs of torque but ran out of breath fast regards\\nkyfdx wouldnt heavily modding mean replacing things like stock tires clutch plates flywheels etc 442 dragsters would shred 70s era stock radial tires in about 3 seconds its also a blanket statement to say you cant mod hondas ive seen a modded civic that outran a viper ive seen a modded civic that outran a viper but not probably much over 100 i know one can get a go cart to outran a porsche heck if i could keep from those hit turbo boost michael knight moments with my bmw i could net over 30 mpg on the freeway just cruising at 85100 30 is easy to attain all g owners complaining about gas mileage  part of the solution is a modified upper intake plenum available from two compaines charging about 395 for them look at the stock one  remove the engine cover  and see the slope in the front  the front cylinders are choking for air becasue the 350z was desiged with such a huge slant nose  same motor in our car with same flawthis is not a normal mod this fixes a flaw and allows for a proven better distibution of air flow in an hour and a half it took to install the plenum and some break in miles i went from 270 miles per tank to 430 per tank on highways tripsthis is with another person and weekend luggage while driving fast the entire time i can get from philly to raleigh nc without stopping now also the 20 hp increase and significantly better overall responsiveness throughout the rev range are a huge bonus to stay on topic any of you other sedan owners pushing 300 hp with 10001200 bucks in minor modifications all g owners complaining about gas mileage  part of the solution is a modified upper intake plenum available from two companies charging about 395 for them chris could you please name the two companies my g35 buddy would be interested in this bit of news mine gets 32 while cruising at a nice pace quite happy with the mileage to stay on topic any of you other sedan owners pushing 300 hp with 10001200 bucks in minor modifications 1 the saab guys 2 i flatly dont beleive a plenium upgrade will increase power and economy that much theres just no way the car can produce 260hp at high rpm and be restricted enough to suffer when puttering along on the highway dave dave crawfordzcom has the plenum for 395 kinetix makes a plastic one that has had some issues for about the same price crawford takes a nissan plenum takes the top off and welds on sheet metal to make a new shape on the g forum i frequent with 3500 members there is an absolute consensus that this is the besst bang for buck mod out there for the vq this is not a bolt on honda civic toy this is a fundamental change for the better breathing ability this car should have in the first place if not for the shape of the z hood for which this iteration of the vq is designed have you bud call and chat with doug at crawford and hell be on board tuning like the rest of us who find that those z nuts do all the testing and tuning work to our benefit this motor can easily produce 300hp without spending much cash or making a ton of noise at atco raceway when 300 zs and gs from several forums got together i raced a coupe with 20 more hp out of the showroom i have just the plenum and a lightweight pulley he got a 147  94 in the 14 at 59 degrees with 39 humidity he has a 6 speed and lauched rather well i have an auto and ran a 142 at 97 other sedan autos were running 15s and even a 16 as for the saabs yes that is a great mod car if you dont mind cranking up the turbo boost  same with audi 18sbut who wants to buy a new turbotalking to a na freak here uh oh self proclaimed member of the 300 hp club  kidding aside thanks for the info i dont want to speak for dave but i think the point was that just a plenum is not going to get a g35 sedan owner 40hp 260 vs 300 id be skeptical that your setup is at 300 close maybe but the vq aint like uncorking some v8 where minor boltons yield staggering s i would say that 1015 whp is a reasonable claim wont catch me tinkering under the hood until the warranty expires 260 hp is still plenty fast for me i have no idea what my hp is but i doubt the plenum is worth 40 too how about 20 is what we g guys expect that plus the pulley plus a modified air intake and a grounding kit is what gets you to about 300 or so hell the 350z weight in about 300 less than my car  they run about 144 stock auto with 287 hp so what does a faster heavier car have on the same track same dayyour guess is as good as mine but if i were betting id say more than 287 baby ps the video of this race of me vs the g coupe left the guy holding the camera audibly gasping as i pulled on the coupe as my car hit second he was right there after second gear he was 5 lengths behind  and he has a six speed with 280 stock and was running a pop charger and z intake while not good for 40 hp  this is worthwhile beyond the  paid for it and the results dont lie  email me and i can link you to the discussions the v8 thing is true but dont let your past experience detract you from recognizing that if 2 cylinders of the six are choked for air as they are stock that the modification will help in a significant wayagain  this is not a tin can toy for a tiburon  this is an engine design mod i am assuming that by doing the mod you have essentially voided your powertrain warranty rightor is this something that nissan endorses i do not believe one can make this type change and not void the warranty endorsing is a far cry from denying warranty service they dont need to endorse it to be legally inclined to fix my car if something breaks and that specific mods didnt cause the problem ive been down a long winding road of discovery since i bought this thing and i felt the same way as you about modding before hell ive owned 5 japanse cars and until now the biggst mod i ever made was putting in speakers that didnt sucki am not into stickers or racing on the street or being seen and heard  its about engineering design funtionality and making the 35k i paid for my car pay off in tinkering and improvements that dont hurt the car fun i want to own this thing for 200k miles or 10 years which ever comes first 10 years is looking good why would a better air intake manifold setup hurt the car if the intake plenum itself goes then you get a new one from dougand the only ones to go have been covered by him even though they were all fi induced blowouts of the plenum at the weld points  yer talking 450 hp cars here given that you have effectively improved the car lets hope you didnt drop any bolts or dirt into the intake runners if the day you put the plenum on the car doesnt work becasue you didnt install it correctly  youre on your own but if you put the plenum on and there is a problem with your air flow sensor or the exhaust manifold cracks  well they would have to prove that your mod casued the problem casue and effect are hard for them to come up with in the most clear cut cases the mm act is a good one to get to know it puts the burden of proof on the dealer proven effective mods that dont harm the engine from reputable race teams or proven mod experts is harmless fun to me is there risk  sure but a better design like a plenum that offers better airflow and less air fuel ratio differential for each cylinder or more even distribution of the same air is not going to casue you any problems dont take my word for it call doug or think physics this is no where near the modification level of a forced induction system or something that makes the engine work hotter faster morethis makes it work more efficiently with the existing conditions  ala the better gas mileage adding 40 hp tp this car is not going to hurt it one iota studying the vq for the last few months while researching the viability of lightweight underrive crank pulley i learned that the vq may be the most naturally balanced and most durable engine ever built with 6 holes from the cylinder bank angle to the internal balancing to the tranny that handles 340hp in a v8 platform from the qit all adds up to me no longer worrying about things that wont hurt my engine the worst thing i ever did was a cold air intake and i may put that back on if my girlfriend stops driving it kd\\nwell if it was done with nismo parts and done at a nissan sanctioned facility you would be ok chris\\nyoud be surprised how manufacturers find any excuse to strip you of your warranty sometimes any mod weather related to the warranty repair or not is enough for them to deny you warranty coverage you shouldnt have a problem with the vq because it is a very sturdy engine but just in case be prepared to fight if you go to your infiniti dealership for warranty repair that relates to engine or tranny my dealer actually installed the crank pulley for me there has never been a case where a pulley casued a vq motor to fail when i show up at the dealer the techs come running to see what iv been working on and many are incorporating my mods into thier own maximas and gs many dealers sell the pulley and many have installed the plenum not mine some infiniti dealership will give you a hard time as they are not mod friendlya hard time is easliy overcome with knowledge about your rights as a consumer i get bs from service providers all the time about things they think they cant do a little knowledge always overcomes ignorance and people looking for an excuse to not work or cover the warranty if you put a nismo cold air induction system on and then drive into enough water to hydrolock  you will not be covered the law should be applied consistently regardless of the manufacturer i assure you infiniti wont take on the liablity of all the people driving in fla during the summer rain with a cai on nismo or not nismo does not have to make the aftermarket part to make you feel betteryour warrantly applies in the same manner under the same law no matter what is installed by whoever my point was that if you were installing a nismo part at your nissaninfiniti dealer you have less of a chance of getting your powertrain warranty voided a foreign part in your engine could tempt them to blackball you are well known for trying to cancel the entire vehicle warranty over a swaybar or different shocks heck ive even heard of them trying to void warranties based on aftermarket cd changer installations yer right and my points about the dealer attitude will certainly affect you getting to the desired result which is a fixed car if you didnt break it look the day i went in to get my seat fixed my stock pulley started to squeal like a pig right in the service bayimmediatley some guy who sits at a desk the servuce rep said it was from my injen caii had to take the time to make him go get the real tech so he could tell both of us that it was obviously the pulley point being  some dealers will try to blackball you but the ability they have to actually deny warranty service is against them and thier wishes to make things go away if they think you will because they attribute your problem to your mods you can walk away or you can demand your rights the words magunson moss act during one of these freindly dealer spats turns heads and get results faster than you can say my car goes faster than the new 300c spend some time with people who are nuts about these things like i have and the enlightenment about what you can do and have the right to do is incredible and lets get real  i am not doing much to my car at all so my boldness is not really that bold now is it ive never had a bad experience with an vw service and i actually beat them in a lemon law case service was great all 18 times in one year but i didnt mod my v6 passat i can imagine however that with a car where they dont even know the problems sources as in these problematic electric gremlined nightmares they will try and blame you your rights are your rights and some dealers will make you work to get your point taken seriously sometimes a lawyer freind is helpful here if they didnt prove your mod did and dont fix it then they are breaking the law ive never had a bad experience with an vw service and i actually beat them in a lemon law case service was great all 18 times in one year but i didnt mod my v6 passat theres a weird thing going in the above sentences you never had a bad experience with vw service yet your car was in the shop 18 times in a year that to me signals what my two year ownership of vw confirmed  its an incompetent company if they didnt prove your mod did and dont fix it then they are breaking the law i never had an issue with denial of service  ive read numerous accounts of people who have had issues though my problem was with everything the company did just a bad company that deserves to go out of business to see that theres yet another board in which the laws of physics and thermodynamics have been repealed is the premise here that some bolton outfit has figured out something that the nissan engineers either a were too stupid to see or b found but didnt want to use because they didnt want the engine that they use in 90 of their vehicles to have more power andor fuel economy its a conspiracy i tell you isnt big oil involved somehow p t barnum lives there is no doubt there are ways to squeeze more juice out of an engine but it seems counterintuitive these items can also squeeze a corresponding increase in gas mileage and also increase reliability above manufacturer tolerances i think it all boils down to how comfortable you are with your dealer if your tranny goes the dealer could rightly claim raising the hprev limiter allowed tranny tolerances to go out of spec its a calculated risk i do not as of yet have a rev limiter mod that may come from stillen and i may or may not get it the plenum helps the top end tremendously but the real power for this car is at 4500 or so and addl redline may not help and ps mods to the flash programming are not detecable by the dealer per the dealer and based on the fact that they never check that unless the ecu is replaced to see that theres yet another board in which the laws of physics and thermodynamics have been repealed whose repealing physics the plenum helps the engine based on simple physics this is homer level the measured airflow for the front two cylinders is not consistent with the front two or middle two by a significant measure is the premise here that some bolton outfit has figured out something that the nissan engineers either a were too stupid to see or b found but didnt want to use because they didnt want the engine that they use in 90 of their vehicles to have more power andor fuel economy you almost got it engineers do not make the perfect performance car or it would have 400hp they make a balanced daily driver out of a z platform with all the give and take of design functionality  platform selection engine availabilty somehow those guys at nissan who do a pretty good job based on net income figured that if they were going to have a certain clearance under the hood of the z they would maximaize space using a sloping plenum as stupid as they are they still got 287 hp out of na v6 another whopping 8 in power shouldnt be so hard to believe 20hp is alot but it doesnt change the car break in is also responsible for the addl mileage i qouted and i would attribute the plenum to a 4 mpg increase on the highway while the bolt on outfits may not impress you have you been to one the fact is these guys race weekly and know more about engineering and cars and speed and motors than youd ever believe there are plenty of z cars out there running 330 hp totally na this should be easily believable so to think that i cant get to 300 or so with 1500 in a g with the same platform and same motor give an intake tube and a minor exhaust difference you guys driving lss and 3 series and tls may have your motor on edge cominng out of the factory  mine has 30 more to give and as they release newer versions of the g they will have addl power as well 330 hp in the new m45 from the same vq35 is probable if not foreseeable tinkering is not so bad guys  3500 members giving thorough analysis to this and many other great tweaks such as a free airbox mod and tons others plus the support of a hundred thousand crazy z owners can find plenty wrong with those yucky engineers at nissan and thier crap designs proof is in the pudding 150 or 142 the difference measured in time equates to some horsepower measurement based on the weight of my car i wonder what that number would be 1 there is no possible way a dealer will attribute a non moving part to any detontation or worst case you can dream of its not that hard to make a plenum if you are an expert dont be scared there are hundreds and thousands who taken the leap based on other poeple being the guinea pig to be clear i run no risk for this or any mod i have chosen in terms of dealer warranty issues  this is not a twin turbo install 2 you dont believe it because you attribute a 40 increase in mileage to what i say the sudden blip in mileage the day after i got the plenum speaks for itself and the 2500 others with excel spreadsheets and milage chartssha what do you think bettermore air does to your car  effeciency come to my mind and better gas mileage would come from that as a default is your denial based on the 3 series having few mods like this 3 i increase the reliablity by doing two things a lightening the load on my crank with a lite weight pulley and b improving and eqaulizing the airflow distribution to all intake runners ive been studying the physics on these for a while i dont proclaim power numbers for the sake of it without a dyno chart but you can see them from others with the same exact mods on more enthusiastic car specific forums for yourself those 2 mnods are worht 30hp what do you think bettermore air does to your car  effeciency come to my mind and better gas mileage would come from that as a default is your denial based on the 3 series having few mods like this better performance at the expense of gas mileage ive never seen a mod on any car that increase performance and gas mileage at the same time if that were the case there would be a mod that increases gas mileage thorough the roof im still waiting for one of them you must be the only one that gets better performance more pulling power and a whoppping increase in overall gas mileage why do you think the subaru 25 engine can get an abysmal 14mpg yeah it produces and it is fa but there is a cost there is always a cost while your discussion at face value sounds nice i do not buy any of it because there is no way to measure it only your conjecture about your interpetation im not saying dont mod the car but i do not believe any engine mod such as you did is the holy grail and in fact will not lead to warranty problems down the line but its okay its not my car you dont have to convince me i wont try and convince you but i wont let other g owner be steered astray by falsities or misinformation most mods that improve performance also improve gas mileage if they relate to af ratio increases if i put a plenum on my car and the air flow is better and my af ratio is better the effect is a more effecient car if you suggest that i can get 4 mpg only from my dreams then perhaps once you have some expereince in modding cars lightly you can join my dream if you havent modded a car you may not understand that air is your friend and air is free it contains the o2 that powers the little pistons with the help of a detonating catalyst petrol the more air in the ratio the more power is extracted given a fixed amount of fuel i have a hard time seeing where you miss this but look at it this way if the af ratio is 10 to 1 stock and i put a mod on that gets me 12 to 1 which most intake mods do add air the results are more power which  less work for the motor for the same loads and speeds  better gas milage most people driving modded gs are there reporting 2529 most stock ones are 1723 not scientific study but not its rocket science either theres a weird thing going in the above sentences you never had a bad experience with vw service yet your car was in the shop 18 times in a year that to me signals what my two year ownership of vw confirmed  its an incompetent company it is some weird stuff im saying but youre correctthe manufacturer is losing it and they are in disarray the phaeton is dead on arrival the beetle is about had its run  what are they going to make it look like now the passat was a great car except for the demons that live in the electrical system and its about a year past its sylish life and what was that 40k w8 pos motor thats slower than a vq all about luxury brand remaking is good if your customers dont stress about getting it home very night in light of all this the dealer was great and the service guys were very nice and gave me loaner cars when they didnt have to and were professional timeley and very courteous but i wish i didnt have to find out they were nice they made the most of thier opportunity to correct the uncorrectable jim wynn in norristown pa by the way in the words of the guy who handed me a check for all my money back less 200 bucks for mileage once they get a bug you cant kill it he said the 7 series is the biggest electrical nightmare in germany right now as all the cool electrical modules and miles of fiber optics and 30 way headrests make it fail at almost 2 rate never german is my motto even as i represent my friends and family at the audi dealer in thier purchasesyes i love to negotiate and i buy cars for fun and free for them thier money of course and i still give the passat thumbs up for being the best family sedan out there for the   as long as you get a good onequite a caveat but im surprise when i tell people about my expereince how they still want the passatgreat car for themwonder what will save them now i wont try and convince you but i wont let other g owner be steered astray by falsities or misinformation huh since when does manufacturers that provide mods the g have the lock and key on plenum upgrades breathing easier implies more gas not more efficiency there is a little thing called the throttle body and cylinder design that also contributes to the overall fuel efficency but we are way off topic here and talking about misinformation i would like an infiniti dealer to come on by to this forum and say there is no warranty issue and that mods such as yours increase performance average gas mileage efficiency and reliability as you claim for that infiniti dealer will be getting my business next no questions asked g35drivercom you can be schooled all your willing since when does manufacturers that provide mods the g have the lock and key on plenum upgrades breathing easier implies more gas not more efficiency there is a little thing called the throttle body and cylinder design that also contributes to the overall fuel efficency lock and key on what if you can weld you can do this but theres no point on a bmw  the plenum is not sloped in the front hell the plenum design is completely different on a straigh six you can add a hood scoop ram air deal like my dads duster had  go for it only this car g as i am aware would benefit from a plenum change most cars already have a level plenum so i guess we do have a lock and key the throttle body is fine and so is the cylinder size and designwhat are you talking about those things work well even with a choking plenum no infiniti dealer will ever condone aftermarket mods they usually are too ignorant to understand that they have to fix the car unless they can prove the mod created the problem you want the answer speak to my lemon attorney who deals in warranty cases on the side you have more rights than you give yourself credit for the consumer shouldnt be held down by the ignorant whims of a unknowledgable service rep or tech or dealers the ones i talk to will say hey great mod but not in front of thier antimod manager obviously if a dealer comes out and says mod all you want hell be dealing with idoits who botch thier installs and act like nothing was even touched by them let alone modded its cut and dry in form but dealers will try and manhandle you as with most others that try to screw me out of my money they will lose if you do want to talk to a dealer who is mod ornery grubbs infiniti acctually builds race cars and test cars and offer a full service tuner shop where you can buy nismo and a host of aftermarket products intalled by them dont be fooled by the never been theres my dealer never saw mods until i and subsequently a few others brought in modded gs last year they have been educated and will continue to be as long as the trend for getting that easily obtained 300 hp is around i used to be skeptical too when i asked these questions the anwers were there for the plucking the anti mod attitude takes a while to get over and then you see the light maybe you should buy an infiniti now that you know all this great stuff nismo is sponsored and supported by nissan just like in europe some supercharged induction systems are supported and installed by bmw again i am not saying these mods dont do something but i do not believe the infiniti engineers were too stupid or ignorant to miss obvious design points that would weaken an otherwise great car  when a third party shop comes in with a fix for 500 that will increase performance reliability and gas mileage thats what youve been implyingsaying and im contesting chris i wont go into horrible detail but be warned that nmac is a absolute nightmare to deal with if you have a problem i still think some of nissaninfinti cars out there are very good but from my dealings with them after my last maxima lease they have lost me for good love the product hate the company sounds like a nightmare speedracer dealing with corporate morons in vw was in my mind so difficult as it infuriates people to no end and they just go away and buy another car your case may be different but when you actually have a leg to stand on such as a lemon law and an attorney  things start to get way easier in my experience i actaully told vwoa i simply wanted a warranty that would keep me happy in the car after the 224000 was up and free from unlimitied repair costs for a young car they laughed and told me flat out nothey want you to go away and or get an attorney  they dont want to deal with an unhappy consumer the frim i used has prelitigation programs with vw where they settle 20 cars at a timebut they cant give me an extended warranty it never even occurred to me to sue them until she laughed at me\\ni had a such a good set of fact in my favor the attorney i hired told me in 15 minutes i would win and the next i heard vwoa was back on the phone asking how i would like the buy back guy to obtain my car in exchange for a check to the point that the designers are stupid look all the g had to have was enough hp to dethrone a couple of stlawart sedans from the top of the hill if it gets better hp or equal for that matter to the class contenders whats the problem i would bet that 30 in your car has some more power stashed in thereits a function of exterior design in the z g casemoney is probably a bigger one hell we could put forged internals in all the cars and bigger camsat some point the marketers take over and say lets build the car with x horsepower and y looks and z price if it sells then the slanted plenum is not such a big dealexcept to those of us who want the power and dont have the slanted hood of the z turn out it fits in the z too if you take out the hood liner no engine sold today has all the perfect design attributesthey are all filled with trade offs unless you get exotic this trade off was a sloped hood for 20 hp and its a good move obviously since they sell zs like candy and the engine does pretty well gettting them 1320 feet in 135 stock thats carerra territory almost so while you wonder about that others were saying hey  we can do better and they do this seem like voo doo to you the way it used to to me its ok kd  deep breath getting back to the point the vq is a very tunable engine it is no wonder that nissan literally uses it in nearly its entire product line nissan has varied the hp rating by applying minor tweaks to the engine or exhaust system you are living proof that getting more juice out of the vq can be done inexpensively in the aftermarket world as well as we discussed the risk is being denied warranty service if something goes wrong solution is either have 1a good dealer 2 a good mechanic as to your rant about why companies dont give you the maximum potential in your engine go figure my audi 18t with the right chip program can generate 200hp why do they give a measly 170hpmy thought so they dont trounce their v6s the audi can actually get a 70hp increase from a chip i hear high boost has its own set of risks thoand that risk everyone keeps talking about is more like the risk for my minor mods anyway that the owner wont have the fortitude to actually get something they deserve and will cavethe law is the law its certainly a pt barnum moment hello everyone\\ni have been quoted 34000 for a demo 2004 tl auto with nav silverebony rear spoiler protection package and side moulding should i take this car it has 1400 miles is demo car considered a used car\\nall opinions would be appreciated please be quick as i have to respond by tomorrow if it were me i wouldnt demo cars get treated very badly probably wasnt broken in according to manufacturers recommendations for a few bucks more you could get a new model if you skip the nav you can get it for 31k id say 30k for it max i finally got a good drive in a 5speed 95 aero its my favorite so far from this topic there was one at the dealer with the ventilated seats  this is awesome  and 3500 miles used for a little over 30k\\n  highs\\n  ventilated sport seats fit me perfectly\\n  top safety\\n  quiet comfy and cool\\n  huge trunk\\n  lows\\n  still some turbo lag\\n  handling ok not great\\n  idle sort of rough now im really thinking it over so far this is the only one thats made me really cognate\\n  i still dont believe the g35 hpmpg increase based on the plenum nissand sell lots more of them if they got that much more power and economy out of a simple mod sat in a tl but these cars are just not designed for someone with my bodyframe so i didnt drive it dave measures emotion of new car purchase in addition to reliability the germans still do very well vw finishes first among large manufacturers mb ties for first overall with infiniti note that nissan does better than toyota and honda httpwwwdetnewscom2004autosinsider040526autos163346htm very interestingthats where the american makers lose over and over depsite top s in all jd categorieswho gets emotional nonetheless passionate about thier car i love my and felt very good about my passat nissan has always done better than the other japanese makers in this regardz car baby i would never go near a demo most of them are used and abused by the dealership sales news for may 04 1 tl 7177 units\\n2 es 7099 units\\n3 g35 3394 units sedan\\n4 g35 2732 units coupe\\n5 tsx 3585 units weird the tsx is outselling the g35 sedan i see probably 56 g35s a day and maybe one tsx per week how could they sell over 3500 in one month when they are only selling 15k20k per year that doesnt seem right regards\\nkyfdx since tsx was number 5 i have to assume that first digit should be a 2 not a 3 no that is the correct number for tsx sales this is the link  httpwwwhondanewscomcatid1000mid2004060256078mimeasc it surprised me too the g35 coupe moves 2700 units a month that is a lot of coupes in an even tougher market segment coupes m i see a lot of g coupes around the ny area sales dont always make sense when they are skewed to certain locations for instance the 7 isnt doing well youd never know it around ny seems im always staring into that big ol fat ugly butt okay i wonder where they are selling them if you go to the local dealer he has 3040 tls on the lot and 2 tsxs im not going to doubt their published figures but i live in a metropolitan area and i almost never see one regards\\nkyfdx because you dont see them they are no selling get real buddy you are only focussing on your metropolitan region honda sales figure is on a national basis would they publish a materially incorrect number like that i said  i dont doubt them but ive shopped for them and the local dealers two have almost no inventory and i almost never see them the post was about my personal experience if you have a personal experience perhaps you could share it with us buddy regards\\nkyfdx isnt the tsx a lot cheaper than either of the g35 models so there are more potential buyers for it since more people could afford it would they publish a materially incorrect number like that i yes and the fact it was listed last is a clear sign they had a typo the fact it was listed last is a clear sign they had a typo there are no clear signs here they could have put it last because of the combined g35 sedancoupe numbers i see a lot of tsxs in the ny area also i was at an acura dealer recently and saw plenty of them on the lots i think sales vary greatly according to location checked honda news and acura did move 3500 tsxs in may wow my apologies no problem it would be interesting to see sales according to locations within the us when the 5series came out in october it must have been two months before i saw one pop up on the road yet i heard they were all over the place in ca i would imagine fwd cars are not as popular on the left coast as they are in the northeast acuras in all flavors are very popular around here rl is a struggle though i would imagine fwd cars are not as popular on the left coast as they are in the northeast surprisingly not true the import tuning scene is huge up and down the entire west coast there just arent a lot of rwd cars out there for the 20 something crowd muscle cars and trucks excluded of course yep it was only a guess because of the fwdsnow thing im sure there would be a lot of surprises if there were a thorough breakdown of national sales stats available to us i guess the marketers have them that car is all over the place in ca i dig it and to this day feel like its the best bargain for sub 30k cars luxurious nice handling great engine and smoothest 6 speed ive ever touched yummy and a good 13k less than my car cost me as ive said many time if acura drops awd  especially with some kind of computer control for power  into their smaller cars tl tsx ill most likely defect from bmw for the 6 speed alone its nearly worth it theres a lot of buzz on the tsx enthusiast sites from reliable sources about awd coming to the tsx and tl in the future it seems pretty likely shawd httpwwwautospiescomarticleindexasparticleid2825cat egoryid10 that could be real nice btw ive seen some new posts that say the upcoming e90 3 series which should arrive in may of 2005 will have engine choices ranging from a low 30l inline 6 at 250 hp midrange 35l inline 6 at 290 hp 40l v8 at 400 hp m3 and finally the 44l v8 at 440 hp for the m3 csl yeah ive been interested in what the new 3 series will be photos ive seen look modern and handsome on the outside and i even like the new interior look of the 567 series i think i remember reading that initially the new 3 will have the carryover engines with new engines coming later i really want the new 3 to knock my socks off unfortunately i suspect that it will be more bloated and luxurious than the e46 and ill have to look towards the new 12 series for my modernday spiritual e30 successor waiting to see hi i dont want to discuss which car is better but basically i like the 330i with zhp a bit better than the g35 due to interior and exterior looksin a big way actually of course the 6k or 7k difference can help the g35 seem like the way to go since i really want the bmw i need to rationalize paying the extra moneyso can anyone help me estimate the maintenance costs on the g35 during the first 4 years  i want to add that to the price of the g35 to compare to the bmw which includes maintenance can i assume it is close to 2k or will it be cheaper if 2k that would bring the prices within 5k of each otherstill a big differencebut then again if the resale value of the bmw after 4 or 5 years is 4 or 5k above the resale value of the infinitithe cost to own either car would be about the same except sales tax would be slightly higher on the bmw and interest on the higher loan am i reaching here maybe im wrong to assume the infiniti will lose as much  value as the bmw over the 45 year periodim just guessing this because bmws are so popular id think it would be easier to sell any comments would be appreciated bmw 330i\\nmsrp 42k\\nselling price 37k\\n4 yr residual value 21k\\nsales tax 6 2220\\ninterest4yr loan 5 4135\\nmaintenance

accord as a barometer plus 20\\ntotal 4yr cost 20280 difference 2075 over 4 years im estimating a lot of this i do know the bmw has a 2400 dealer incentive so 5k off sticker is achievable i havent been following pricing on the g35 so that may be too generous a discount or not generous enough i estimated both cars to be worth 50 of msrp in 4 years assuming 48k miles that is probably a little generous for both but it gives you a baseline if you assume the bmw will have a little better resale percentagewise then it gets the numbers closer regards\\nkyfdx not that it is a huge issue however the bmw gets better mileage then again if gas prices keep rising it might turn into a big issue best regards\\nshipo honestly if you like the bmw better just go with it i was gungho on the g35 kd and i used to go rounds when the g hit the street i was convinced it would be my next car i drove everything under the sun but a manual 330i they were tough to get my hands on between march and may of 2003 the g35 with the 6 was great fantastic but yet it didnt quite feel perfect for me then i drove a 330ci with manual and felt i could like that car the next day i got my hands on a 330i zhp that was still covered in plastic i unwrapped it like a big present took it out for one of cunningham bmws excellent twistyhillyall road types drives i signed for it 30 minutes later i knew as soon as i drove the 330i zhp that i simply would not be happy with another car price be damned you only live once if you can negotiate it in your area shoot for 1900 below invoice theres a 2400 rebate on the car thats 500 dealer profit decent dont pay any bogus extra fees either if you cant get that where you live but youre near the west coast  email around southern cal there are so many dealers theyre very cutthroat my dealership did 400 over invoice in may 2003 and still does on 3 series cars with a rebate i would have been at 2k below invoice buy in so cal and just hop a southwest flight out here if you cant beat the price locally 1200 for 4 year maintenance could be a stretch if you dont use the dealer and do some stuff yourself  air filter and cabin filter alone cost 350 or so over 4 years and you can get that to 75 or less doing it all yourself oil and gas is all this thing really needs and 1 good fluid change in 60k there is little work involved in keeping a vq running brakes are covered for 36k no matter what invluding rotors the bmw free service is not all that free as i understand it what they give you is 15k service  basically oil and filter and they check everything my dealer is very good at this as well but they charge base service fee to check everything and change oil for 250 and all addl labor and parts extra for a 7500 mil checkup i dont need anything but oil and washer fluid thanks bmw will need little hopelfully and less likely tho in those same intervals but you will be paying to change your oil 2 of 3 times unless you like burnt sludge on your internals marketing is powerful  read furhter into it and dont forget you can mod your g save another 4 mpg add 30 hp all for 1000 bucks 300 hp if you can turn a ratchet and 260 if notway more fun than a 330i imo wwait for the new 330 if you get one and wait for the new lineup of motors as well bmw isnt gouig to be 2nd for long i guess infiniti will respond in 07 with a g45 if im lucky kd and i used to go rounds when the g hit the street lol the good ol days the bmw free service is not all that free as i understand it that is correct they cover about 95 of the normal car maintenance bmw will not cover tires headliner alignments abuse and a few other miscellaneous items not sure about tranny flushescoolant flushes everything else is covered in a 4 year50k bb warranty service is based on the cars service interval indicator and costs 0 they cover the fluids microfilter brakesbrake flush and wipers and what ever else is specified so far in two years of ownership ive spent 0 on the car for anything the only out of pocket was for the car alarm chris in my experience with nissans brakes should be your biggest worry both of my nissans had to have the padsrotors replaced very early well i was trying to do an apple to apples comparison most people have their maintenance done at the dealership at least during the warranty period i dont think im far off on an infiniti dealer charging 1200 for six maintenance visits every 7500 miles up to 45k and if the car needs brakes the bmw comes out even further ahead as the bmw dealer does it for free 2075 is still over 40mo more not an insignificant amount but definitely a number that you can slide by your significant other to get the car you really want i tried to run all those numbers without a bias but if i was putting hard numbers to it id guess the infiniti would depreciate more on a percentage basis and the bmw would wear out tires faster so in real life the numbers could vary a lot one way or another if it wont break your budget always get what you want regards\\nkyfdx id guess the infiniti would depreciate more on a percentage basis and the bmw would wear out tires faster so in real life the numbers could vary a lot one way or another i thought the intervals bmw recommends and will pay for service on are at 15k i hear they make you pay for 2 oil changes in between the depreciation of the g is the best in class of coupes and much higher residuals are offered for both versions of the g the 54 3 year 12k number i got is more like 61 or so now which for 3 years is awesome ive heard 63 or 66 for coupes but not buying it unless i see it in person these cars hold value equally well imo people were worried 2 years ago but resales are going very well on the g front ps why would bmw tires wear out faster and for g brakes  they can wear out every 10k as long as the rotors dont gore out imo these things rock like none other and grab like governer arnold pads are cheap especially when they are free upto 36k my car has 20k and they have 30 left or so some are replacing at first oil change  brake riders i guess or la atlanta jersey trafficlove the train thought the intervals bmw recommends and will pay for service on are at 15k i hear they make you pay for 2 oil changes in between no you get an oil change when the light comes on ps why would bmw tires wear out faster driving style i ran through my potenza 18 inch re40s in under 15k miles of course i drive my car as if i stole it and for g brakes  they can wear out every 10k as long as the rotors dont gore out imo these things rock like none other and grab like governer arnold pads are cheap especially when they are free upto 36k my car has 20k and they have 30 left or so some are replacing at first oil change  brake riders i guess or la atlanta jersey trafficlove the train ive owned nissans they unfortunately do seem to eat brakes i think the problem with nissan is that they use cheap rotors back when i hung around nissan boards a lot folks used to complain about their rotors warping easily thanks for the responses im definitely not the type to try and fix my own car i have a mustang gt and i installed a kn air filter but thats about all i did on my own so if i had the g35 id be bringing it to the dealer for service whenever it was due i know a couple people with bmws and they dont change the oil until 15k miles since its synthetic maybe some people cringe at the thought of waiting that long but my friends havent had any problems and i cant imagine the dealer would recommend something that could harm the car i havent researched depreciation  i just assumed the bmw would hold its value a bit better since they appear to be more in demand  but thats just my perception and i could be wrong i see mostly g35 coupes and not so many sedans and the dealer seemed more willing to deal than the cocky bmw dealers i live in san francisco bay area the 330 zhp has 18 inch wheels wheras the g35 sedan has 17sso tires should wear out faster on the bmw blueguy  thanks ive read your posts and you sound extremely happy with your carmaybe ill be in your shoes soon but i have yet to test drive the 330 which id like to do soon and then test drive the g35 right after i wanted to determine if the 330 was in my price range before going to drive it because im sure ill love it i will definitely look in socal  a friend suggested santa barbara i cant complain about my zhp when i get home on weekdays i want to hug my beautiful baby sitting in the garage come friday night im excited to get home and slide behind the wheel of my bmw i actually miss my car mf need another red pepper for that dish ill go to the store to get itand take the long way once im back ill find another excuse to split im helping another friend look for a car right now and shes all over the map from the tl to the xb to mazda3 to the escape the only set in stone for her no european cars shrug okey dokey its an arduous process to pick out a car if one really wants to get the car that fits them like a glove i quoted the 330ig35coupe with my insurance aaa nj the 330i was about 40 higher than the g35coupe if you want to factor in gas mileage than you should add insurance cost into the picture when i was shopping for my 530i a couple of years ago i cross shopped the g35 and my insurance company liberty mutual in nj told me that the 530i was something like 150 cheaper than a g35 and only 60 more per year than my then current 328i that said the g35 was just new on the market at the time maybe things have changed i will say that i have always been surprised at how cheap my two bmws have been to insure my 1999 328i was about 110 less than my previous 1995 passat glx and my 530i is 32 cheaper than our family hauler a 2003 dodge grand caravan es go figure  best regards\\nshipo yeah that seems strange my 03 325i is only 75 more per year than the 01 4cylinder accord it replaced about 10 more i almost said something about insurance rates but i was going to guess the infiniti would be higher regards\\nkyfdx i second shipo i got a dirt cheap quote for a bmw in nj as well iirc my 00 maxima se costs slightly more than my 03 g35sedan to insure they are about the same 600 each per year northern va 600 a year that is not even enough to pay for liability coverage alone and i have been driving 25 years with a perfect record lol it shows you what new yorkers have to pay i pay a lot more for my 03 max than my 97 max probably due to higher hp and hid theft concerns i believe one can get a decent price ie not msrp on a g35 these days has anyone compared a similarly equipped g35 against the tl which is better priced not from dealers perspective i can only speak to personal experience the g35coupe was even cheaper to insure than the 02 es330 which happens to be with aaa nj i would have never thought that this was an 03 330i which i had a deposit on at the time i thought the bmw quote was high but now outrageous the real surprise was how cheap the g35coupe was to insure the c class deserves consideration especially with the interior and mechanical redesign i am more interested with the c230 sport sedan with very good fuel economy and a bmwlike performance excellent oversized 4piston brembo brakes staggered 17 wheels without sacrificing luxury ride and excellent noise control the c320 has a much smoother  heavier engine but it takes away the fun factor and the tossability of the car hey you only live once you might as well enjoy it yeah mb reliabilityas if bmws werent bad enough i traded in my 2001 330ci for a 2004 g35 cpe about 4 months ago i will admit that the g35 exhaust sounds powerful and it is probably quicker off the line than the 330 but the 330 is actually quicker 060 also the 330 is a quieter car on the roadi tend to hear more road noise in the g35 as far as gas mileage i now get about 20 worse mileage than my bmw i do have to admit though that the g35 seats are very comfortable bottom line is that there is a difference but the g35 is also 10 less than a similar 330ci i can personally attest and sill readily assure you that the bmw is not faster 060 unless in perf package if you buy an auto the difference between the two autos is about 8 or so difference all 3 series fall short or barely match perf only the g 14 mile time the g is more visceral and with more engine noise the ride is louder  but with 220 watts of bose you wont care unless you are like me and you like th noise i havent put in a cd in 3 months and barely turn it on with 277 or whatever hp the g will run about 141 in the quarter my guess thats unreacheable buy any bimmer without spending 75k on 545 or 65 on a m3 can personally attest and sill readily assure you that the bmw is not faster 060 unless in perf package if you buy an auto the difference between the two autos is about 8 or so difference buying an automatic in a sports sedan  its like forcing jessica alba to wear a sackcloth all the time is your car an auto thats unreacheable buy any bimmer without spending 75k on 545 or 65 on a m3 your prices are interesting wrong but interesting 58 msrp on the 545i and 47k on the m3 thats unreacheable buy any bimmer without spending 75k on 545 or 65 on a m3 for having 50 hp on the 3 series the g35 coupe is probably only marginally faster in the 14 mile buying an automatic in a sports sedan  its like forcing jessica alba to wear a sackcloth all the time is your car an auto  yes it is i dont want to hear it there are few autos that are this fast when compared to 6sp counterparts i drive it everyday and dont want fat left leg sydnrome from driving in philly traffic if i wanted a true sports car with tru sports tranny for tru sports driving on the weekend i would look into the miata or the 2 series coming soon a 5 series size family cruiser with 4 doors is not lacking in 5at form especially at the track where i have done quite well i owned a 5 speed for 12 years or so  i know all about feeling connectedi dont miss it one bit and since it doesnt slow the car down too much its prob best left to the new buyer to decide in 6mt form the g 14 miles are sub 14 show me a quarter less than 145 for any 3 series and ill make more sense of the comment for having 50 hp on the 3 series the g35 coupe is probably only marginally faster in the 14 mile  marginally faster is still faster 146 or 145 vs 139 or 14 is a major difference and worth the savings no less that a g is over a 3 lets see marginally  faster and cheaper in any trannyand dont forget if there are doubters these numbers i qoute are with 260hp with 270 or more those margins will not get anything but bigger 4 seconds is a whooping at the track as the coupes i run can attest as for 545 being sub 60 ha are you kidding a loaded new 530 is 5456k as ive shopped them and there are no discounts for a 545 the old 540 loaded was near 68 or so m3 for 47k  stripped maybe and with a discount i cant get  the 330 loaded is 44 man for 3 more k wed all be in m3 me included if you can get these prices please email me as i am the family car shopper and there is a demand at these numbers marginally faster is still faster 146 or 145 vs 139 or 14 is a major difference and worth the savings no less that a g is over a 3 yes i agree if you want a g but if you want a bmw youll be getting substantially better gas mileage more refined ride better precision machine and a nice looking ride to boot your ride you decide if youre really talking about racing then you can supercharge your m3 and do 0100 in 5 seconds if you want a stripper m3 just order it youll wait a few months but youll get the car you want you can order a stripper m3 for 47895 here for manual transmission cars driver skill and familiarity with the clutch  shifter will make a huge difference the car mag guys are paid to do this and use aggressive means are you willing to turn your tc system off and drop your clutch at 35000 rpms and smoke your tires few real world drivers even come close on the street and if they do it they dont do it many times even bmws smg launch control will only allow so many of the most brutal launches forget if the number is 567 an automatic transmission takes most of the driver skill out of it it is easier for the average person to get close to theoretical maximum performance since there are fewer variables and less driving skill is needed dont forget that gearing and final drive ratios are critical a huge key to best 060 mph time is to do it needing only 2 gears 1st and 2nd time between shifts is wasted too many cars require a shift to 3rd to hit 60 mph theyll hit the rev limiter before reaching 60 mph and you have to upshift cds 560 mph street start time is probably the best single acceleration number for the average street driver its been too long so here goes yes i agree if you want a g but if you want a bmw youll be getting substantially better gas mileage more refined ride better precision machine and a nice looking ride to boot your ride you decide 1 substantially better gas mileage ok you win folks do report 36 better in a 3 over g got to have fuel to beat the class to tears 2 more refined ride no is this more interior stuff because in stock 27k form the g handles better is faster than and out tractions new term the 330 and matches the 330 zhp the latest test has the g sedan with 215s at 9 skidpad and most slaloms stats have the g at 66 or so and never once second to a 330 in direct comparison there is nothing the 3 does better except maybe in ride quality where o where is the refinement in a vehicle that is second to the leader in all performance categories i must have missed that when i bolted for the infiniti dealer after my 330 was 44k and get this no more refined than the 28k g i test drove in fact all the extra wheel base is more 5 series like than 3 according to the bimmer loving soon to be in laws who claw at my g all weekend the 3 is refined and it has the interior of a german car sure  but it cant run the road any better than a g beyond the intricacies of personal preference always subjectiveness here but lets take a look at what the media has to say once in a while when they consistently dub the g the class leader im sure the new 3 will address this in spades 3 better precision machine  um no what does this mean since the car is slower and handles almost as well as a g does the 3 have some inbred feeling of precision that makes it feel like it can handle or acccelerate like a g when it cantwhatever it is it costs too much  way too much 4 nice looking ride yes you are correct the 3 is great looking and will prob be the best looking of the 17 series once refined to bangles desires at least he got 15 of 3 right  the 5 is growing on me again the old 3 is a classic desing for sure  i wonder if they thought they would sell that many here  ubiquity is a sign of success the g is like the cowboys  ok blueguy  the g is like j lo  either people love her or hate her supercharge an m3  power is not lacking in an m3 but that would keep me from going far from home with all the problems a over stroked engine already has at 9k rpm  another 140 ft would be a detenation waiting to happen im a na guy ps the vq handles about 400500 hp fi without reinforced internals if one had to build a car from scratch and get the most hp i know pleny of fi gs that would cause one to scratch thier head when considering a m3 guys with 6 pounds of boost are getting 125s with street tires really does anyone fi an m3 they must really turn down the boost ps im building my m3 now and its 1500 just to have the paint i want ok 55k without too much extra is more like it less than i thought  o wait no cd changer  jeez id give the prescision machine tittle to infiniti since they are more reliable than bmws i think the correct word is probably teutonic teutonic with bangle as design director nah those days are over designman be nice the 3 series is not bangled yet thats next year ahh the e46 were at the last chance saloon here get em while you can cds 560 mph street start time is probably the best single acceleration number for the average street driver ive never understood that one  drop the car into first and take off like a bat out of hades  the sillier one involves top gear from like 30 or 50 uh what sort of a tool with a 6 speed tries to speed up in 6th from 50 thats a cruising gear  use it over 80 mph msrp on a 545i is 58k if i wanted that car stripped like that im sure i could get a deal for it at least a grand below that price probably more off than that as for fi g35no way talk about nuking a warranty a nicely packaged g35 is like 34k msrp 30k before ttl nice deal if you like the car a guy in an sti can obliterate all the cars mentioned but just like the g35 the car didnt appeal to me i cant change the fact i just didnt love the g35 i wanted too im sure my accountant wishes id gone that route too if outright performance were my only goal either of the wrx models would be in my garage i expected more from my sports sedan and only one company offered a product i could put up with day in and day out it wasnt acura or infiniti i wish it had been blueguydotcom what happens when you drop the car into first and take off like a bat out of hades smokingshredding rubber premature clutch wear possible drivetrain trauma the 560mph street start is how most drivers do their testing cant say i have any desire to do smoking burnouts tires are expensive and i need them for handling not to create smoke the top gear testing data indicates engine torque and relative gearing just check out the difference between say a 6speed manual tsx a 6speed manual g35 coupe and a 6speed manual gto blueguydotcom what happens when you drop the car into first and take off like a bat out of hades smokingshredding rubber premature clutch wear possible drivetrain trauma none of the above i can slip into first in my bimmer and simply launch no fuss no tcs nothing but zipping away i do it quite often if im creeping a light i know that will change soon roll up slide into first and when the light changes slam it home the 560mph street start is how most drivers do their testing cant say i have any desire to do smoking burnouts tires are expensive and i need them for handling not to create smoke never had smoke coming from my tires  even with traction control off and the car going sideways the top gear testing data indicates engine torque and relative gearing just check out the difference between say a 6speed manual tsx a 6speed manual g35 coupe and a 6speed manual gto \\nand on any of those cars if theyre geared correctly the car should be turning almost no rpms at 60 or 30 in 6th gear only an tool would attempt to punch it at 60 mph in 6th gear you dont buy a manual to totally be out of control of the car 3rd gear works fine at those low speeds 6th is for over 80 ideally around 100 top gear is supposed to be a cruising gear not a passing gear sounds like the sort of test a magazine would do to compliment the lazy american style of driving blueguydotcom remember im talking about the average driver and most drivers in usa are driving automatics keep in mind that many cars dont allow you to disable or fully disable their traction control system in these cars you cant achieve maximum acceleration launches and other cars lack the engine output to really smoke their tires no matter how high the rpms before you drop the clutch unlike the aggressivelaunch 060 mph test the 560 mph test is a very good indicator of the average persons ability to reliably duplicate the test result esp in an automatic the 560 is a good test mainly because it involves no revving up and clutch drop it takes the spinning tire and driver ability equation out of the acceleration numbers it can give you a good handle on torque and turbo lag etc the top gear thing is just silly if the car is automatic they obviously cant keep it in top gear so the test is useless but they still do it regards\\nkyfdx we must be reading different magazines i apologize in advance if the topic has come up before and sorry to divert from the current train of thought but \\x85 has anyone else struggled with the transition to a car for the middleaged midcareer uppermid income person with spouse  kids i am having difficulty making the leap to what i consider 147boring148 cars don146t get me wrong i appreciate the fact that a good 6speed sport coupesedan with 22 seating on average will go from 060 in less than 6 seconds and run the skid pad at over 88g what i am referring to are the bland body styles  interior that tell you that the car146s driver runs a mile in more than 8 minutes sees a therapist has a nonaggressive investment portfolio listens to 70s rock and has a shortterm memory problem the tl 6mt g35 6mt coupe 330ci have bland common body styles and interiors they are not headturners four seat headturners exist in other classes mazda rx8 volkswagen bug convertible bmw mini cooper dodge magnum it seems there is a need for a class of automobile in the 35k range that fulfils all of the needs of the nearluxury buyer with kids  plus has headturning appeal the people with the means to acquire a vehicle in this price range plus the need for a sedan as opposed to a boxster or s2000 or something are generally conservative otherwise known as bland i have one of these blandmobiles and couldnt even get it in a decent color back in 2000 only bmw offered a true red everyone else offered two or three shades of gold the obligatory silver black  white  precious little else everythings metallic the better to hide defects rather than good olfashioned solid colors like red orange  brg among others even if all you want is a headturning color this is not the segment for you never mind a headturning vehicle good luck in your quest i feel your pain httpwwwmercurynewscommldmercurynewsbusinesscolumnistsbu siness_update8948216htm registration required as someone speculated about the new 3 series having some kind of ipod integration looks like bmw is heading that way however the bmw official didnt say this would be specifically for the new 3series model just that it would be for all bmws and minis cooper that is not ipod head turning automobiles dont exist under 120k even the porsche in my area is so common its not a head turner this is not to say they porsche doesnt make nice looking vehicles however bmw in its price range imo makes the best lookingdrivingentry level luxo automobile yeah in the sf bay area the flashy cars are everywhere i get excited when i see a lamborghini but not much else as for sedans i guess it really has to do with preference i personally think the head turners that you mention such as the rx8 and bug look pretty dumb and id rather have a more normal looking car not bland though like a passat or accord but a bit more sporty like the g35 or bmw bmws are everywhere but i feel the 330 with zhp makes it look a bit different with a different front bumper and wheels that make the car look better maybe people dont even notice those subtle differences though unfortunately i dont like the looks of the g35 so im stuck lusting after the bmw which you see everywhere i guess im just saying that i dont think the bmw looks so boringexcept that many people have them it certainly wont make you look old just my opinion its probably hard to make flashy on a budget and still appeal to a high  of peoplewithout looking ghetto or tacky bland sells four seat headturners exist in other classes mazda rx8 volkswagen bug convertible bmw mini cooper dodge magnum to each his own only the rx8 to me is a head turner and it has far less usable space than the bland tl g35 and 3 series guess im weird as i think the tl g and 3 are sexy and classy while the other cars mentioned are showy donothings it seems there is a need for a class of automobile in the 35k range that fulfils all of the needs of the nearluxury buyer with kids  plus has headturning appeal beauty is in the eye of the beholder unless youre looking to buy a car that other people approve ofwhich is ultraweird the tl 6mt g35 6mt coupe 330ci have bland common body styles and interiors they are not headturners  i had those same thoughts i traded in a 99 navy blue corvette for my 04 cadillac cts because i needed something a bit more practical the cts is more of a head turner then most of the others i was considering the styling certainly isnt bland anyway its a great handling car as wellit gives me some of the same driving enjoyment i had with the corvette the cts is more of a head turner then most of the others i was considering unfortunately its a head turner in the negative sense of the word i think its still plain ugly to be a head turner it still has to be an exotic otherwise the car is stuck in a morass of cars all trying to be head turners where no one car really stands out unfortunately its a head turner in the negative sense of the word speak for yourself sold 50k units last year 25k thru may this year of course the styling of the cts is love it or hate it more people love it right now than hate it i think cadillac did what they had to do with the bold style of the cts they knew they couldnt make it look like a 3 series wannabe so they went with a completely different look the sales figures prove there was a market outside of the classic look of the 3 while the caddy may not turn heads for the same reasons it is turing heads the ctsv is phat and i applaud caddy for going against the grain with the cts sytle theme the angular design is bold and not hard to like imo that style is selling in many iterations and will be with us for a while the ctsv is phat and i applaud caddy for going against the grain with the cts sytle theme its still ugly and that has nothing to do with sales look at hyundai to prove that point i would rather have a new 3 series with the 333hp turbo than a ctsv any day i can just imagine my car with 333hp yummy maybe bmw will even offer up an lsd in arguing about looks everyone has their own opinion easiest way for this discussion to devolve into name calling lets find something else to discuss please regards\\nkyfdx the cover photo of cds march 2004 comparison says it all  they all look like japanese economy cars cut from the same basic bland mold nothing special  you see them everywhere and everyone is driving one anyone of them could be a korean auto a deckedout accord or camry or  is yugo back with a new sedan the desert backdrop is appropriate httpwwwcaranddrivercomarticleaspsection_id15article _id7785page_number1 spend sometime in europe and amerasian sports sedans stand out from the typical european styling at least folks there take badges off cars because they dont want to draw attention i like the cts approach the stealth fighter inspired look i think its too tall though disproportionate dont you think they would have nailed it with a little less height the tail is chunky and the tail lights overpowering the stealth look personified is the cadillac cien its awesome they get an a with this baby auto designers take note this one shows real talent no lamborghini or ferrari has anything on this masterpiece of course im talking only about exterior styling too bad well probably never see it released btw would have given it an a if not for once again the stark blocky rear which seems to afflict most cars today httpwwwedmundscomnewsconceptcarspotlightarticles51600ar     ticlehtml it gets a kinda okay if you take the concept of styling and moving forward bmw did a better job in their 57 series than caddy did with this of course its a prototype but im not a fan of bold angular styling thats why i like the new 57 series i think caddy is going in the right direction seems they are well on their way to proving they can morph into something that was unexpected from them they are pulling off change if they refine and develop some stamina in this direction they should do fine on the other hand the bmw story is developing into one of recovery look at hyundai to prove that point i would rather have a new 3 series with the 333hp turbo than a ctsv any day i can just imagine my car with 333hp yummy maybe bmw will even offer up an lsd  i think you prove my point once hyundia got some itilian designers the cars looked better not g level but thats tuff to beat and sales are better than ever less subjectively 333 hp is heavy duty but a turbo is just against my grain 400 hp in the caddy for 45 or so is tuff to beat especially as na format when will this hit the shelves kd i hear the older 30 is going to be the only option for a couple years by then theyll all have 350 hp options hell the g is only 3540 hp away from that in 05 anywaywith more na refinements to come im sure wow of course its a prototype but im not a fan of bold angular styling thats why i like the new 57 series  what do you call those bangle lines that arent really doing anything but creating angles and seeming so bold the stealth look personified is the cadillac cien its awesome httpwwwedmundscomnewsconceptcarspotlightarticles51600ar     ticlehtml wow a quintessential head turner do they make a 35k 22 seater stripped version ps  the cts does stand out in terms of body style i think you prove my point once hyundia got some itilian designers the cars looked better not g level but thats tuff to beat and sales are better than ever their cars are still ugly re the ctsv different strokes for different folks yes they win bragging rights as eclipsing the japanese in hp per dollar but well have to see how they are in the real world wont we bmws do not have sharp angular styling bold styling can be an advantage or a curse take for example nissan and bmw bmw their designs were generally appealing and handsome enter bangle now their designs are so bold that you either love them or hate them which will probably drive some loyal folks away imo this is an example of the wrong kind of bold design nissan especially in the 90s their cars so bland and unappeling that honda and toyota nearly ate nissan for lunch enter renault yeah the french influence made for some wacky designs but then again nissan needed to take chance to get back in the game bold design along with good product has paid off for nissan do you want to turn heads merely because of looks cars like cts or new hemi 300c or because people in the know know what a car can do m3 or m5 ill take the latter over the former any time substance over style am i the only one that hates that styling the maxima and the saturn ion could be twins at least they have toned it down in the infiniti division i could live with that but ill pass on that bubble look didnt i just say we should quit discussing looks i dont think the new bmw designs are bold the have kicked it up a notch for sure their older brothers while still great looking look tired by comparison different strokes for different folks do you want to turn heads merely because of looks cars like cts or new hemi 300c or because people in the know know what a car can do m3 or m5 ill take the latter over the former any time substance over style isnt that akin to saying my lover has a great personality and is great in bed if so then yes for some people what is beyond the outward appearance is all that counts for others like me it is important to at least ask why cant i have it all do you want to turn heads merely because of looks cars like cts or new hemi 300c or because people in the know know what a car can do m3 or m5 ill take the latter over the former any time substance over style reiz look in the mirror and read your own lips not a legit comparison no apples and oranges  for others like me it is important to at least ask why cant i have it all one can have it all but again its about how you view it not how others do most people say the ferrari modena is a great looking car or the lambo cars are hot to me theyre pretty bland id probably love a drive in one but its not my kind of car so again it seems it should go back to what you find to be be good looking fun to drive and exciting i cant grasp how the opinions of others should make a shred of difference in the purchase of a car what others think of my car is the least important aspect of my car ownership experience ps  the cts does stand out in terms of body style   i have to agree but style is only part of the reason i went with a cts the mercedes c class was too small i drove an e320 which was a very comfortable size and rode nice and smooth it was also 58000 as opposed to the 43000 of my cts and didnt have the acceleration that the cts has what really scared me off of the e class was reading the horror stories about reliabilty over on the mercedes forum\\n   i also checked out the lexusfirst the esa very quiet and refined car but with no pretentions to sports car handling and the rather blah looks of a camry and even the ls the ls is a beautiful automobile with a silky smooth engine and drivetrain but again its styling is rather blandand it costs 58000    the bmw 3 series was a smooth refined car\\nbut again a bit cramped for my tastes    the cts fit the bill best for what i was looking for head turning style first class sport sedan handling a smooth refined engine and drive train and a quiet comfortable interior and ride the fact that there are lots more cadillac dealers in my area then mercedes bmw and lexus dealers combined didnt hurt either i agree with your assessment of caddys art  science theme a little less height would make the cars proportions much better i also think the corner angles are a little too sharp just a minor roundingsoftening of the corner lines would have done the trick imo the cien is a beautiful car v12 750hp decent gas mileage due to dod whats not to like if it makes it to production itll certainly spank bmws 760i which itself is a wonderful car i applaud cadillac and nisssan for being bold and original in their styling even if it doesnt quite work its a design that can be improved on and makes a striking contrast to what is out there today i feel bmw tried to be bold and certain elements of bangles styling work well but there seems to be no overall theme to bangles designs the bangle butt looks like its just been slapped on in darker colors bangles front and sides look good in lighter colors bangles front and sides look disproportionally large i also dont think bangle was that original the front of the new bmws aside from the dame edna turn signals look very much like pontiacs except that i like the pontiacs proportions better pontiacs goal was to become a poor mans bmw first step of gms plan    plant a mole within bmw to make bmws look more like pontiacs    mission accomplished designman my primary consideration is how well the car performs for its price looks are secondary and i really could care less what others think about my car i dont buy cars to impress others i buy them to enjoy the driving experience guess it is the difference between being seen in a car driving down a city street and being out in middle of nowhere driving on some great long and winding roads pontiacs goal was to become a poor mans bmw yes that is it bmw does not design towards gm gm designs toward bmw bmws bold and innovative designs in part are to pull away from the masses and imitators the is no denying the heritage of these brilliant designs but the pontiac is the flavor of the month club i saw somewhere else pictures of a sebring against a 645 i was absolutely aghast at how similiar these cars looked it was said that bmw was copying the sebring then coincidentally somem time after i saw a 645 and sebring in the same general location in a parking lot and it was obvious these cars share the same traits as a ferrari with a hyundai pictures do lie in person the hertiage of a pontiac and a 5 series are also obvious bmw should be flattered after all imitation is the sincerest form of flatter primary consideration is how well the car performs for its price looks are secondary and i really could care less what others think about my car i dont buy cars to impress others i buy them to enjoy the driving experience guess it is the difference between being seen in a car driving down a city street and being out in middle of nowhere driving on some great long and winding roads amen buying cars because theyre headturningsounds like a self esteem issue personally i believe the 6 series is little more than a bloated camry solara when a car must have 4 doors a backseat engine in the front and a trunk in the rear there is only so much a designer can doespecially in the entrylevel class where customers tend to be very conservative personally i dislike styling that appears contrived cadillacs bangle bimmers nissansstyling that tries to make a statement or artificially evoke a feeling without regard to function thats why i like the current 3 series tsxtl and a4 personally i dislike styling that appears contrived cadillacs bangle bimmers nissansstyling that tries to make a statement or artificially evoke a feeling without regard to function thats why i like the current 3 series tsxtl and a4 amen that colour thing regardless of the capability of the vehicle why must all of them be the same tint my cars manufacturer chose to delete the manual transmission two or was it three whole years into the experiment given that degree of commitment to serious sports sedans im not surprised that the colour choice is so weak for the lincoln ls im not so sure what the issue is with the others apparently all in this class thinks that colours that stand out are offensive can we all say lowest common denominator i knew we could come on looks may be secondary to performance but they still matter you cant dismiss interior and exterior design as easily as that a car is more than an engine mated to a transmission and bolted on to a frame while enjoying the performance of a car why not enjoy its beauty as well style is sculpture performance is dance if you dont appreciate both for what they are you could be missing out my friend like a person who eats only steak and refuses to sample cuisine and all of this has absolutely nothing to do with others think i dont hear anyone around here talking about impressing others the term head turner  is pretty generic and benign151synonymous with knockout buttkicking and the corny callow yet always enchanting like totally awesome dude maybe you are reading too much into it  i applaud cadillac and nissan for being bold and original in their styling even if it doesnt quite work its a design that can be improved on and makes a striking contrast to what is out there today well said yeah they both bumble with some of their efforts but are getting things done i would guess the nissaninfiniti design team has iqs ranging from 10 to 190 unlike bmws which has a collective iq of 2 nissan just has to put maxima out of its misery with reservations on the front end g35 rocks151that 34 rear view is nice hey have you seen this alleged nissan gtr concept even if its someones hyperactive photoshop imagination i say find the guy and hire him httpwwwautospiescomarticleindexasparticleid3048cat  egoryid10 the cien is a beautiful car v12 750hp decent gas mileage due to dod whats not to like if it makes it to production itll certainly spank bmws 760i which itself is a wonderful car saugatak go easy man youre messin with the apples n orange nazis ill come to your aid because ill compare diamonds to hot dogs but trust me this one has trouble written all over it  and all of this has absolutely nothing to do with others think i dont hear anyone around here talking about impressing others the term head turner  is pretty generic and benign151synonymous with knockout buttkicking and the corny callow yet always enchanting like totally awesome dude maybe you are reading too much into it \\nno the term headturner means you want people to notice the car you want comments you want to be noticed this is the precise reason i hate owning a bmw like many other makes its got a reputation  a bad one  for being driven by uppity people seeking attention the metal on the cts screams pay attention to me as does the sheetmetal on most exotics many people are attacking pontiac precisely because they made the new gto a stealth car that has no bling that nobody watches the car pass and peers inside to see who is driving that looking for a car to be a headturner is absolutely no different than painting a civic pink dropping it fitting dubs and neon lights and topping it off with a big spoiler its all about attention btw this is one reason i prefer the old m3 no gills nothing outwardly too different on the last gen m3 a debadged 03 m5 is the ultimate as it can stomp the hades out of most cars and its pretty much nondescript different goalsi want to cruise anonymously with all the performance and power i can get i dont want to be noticed apparently others do stylingdesign tends to be about today and the next 10 minutes just standing out making some bold statement but only time will tell if the shape lasts and looks fresh in the future true performance lasts forever a classic almost by definition is a timelessly styled car that truly performs in comparison to the other cars out there think of the porsche 356 and 57 chevy or the jaguar etype corvette stingray and aston martin db6 in the 1960s the bmw 160018002002 in 1960s and 1970s maybe the fiat x19 or porsche 9146 in the 1970s audi in the 1980s dodge viper in the 1990s or the various 911s for about 30 plus years there arent that many design classics even normally beautiful exotic marques like ferrari or maserati have a ton of duds and mediocrities cant say too many italian cars after the 1960s impress me their exotics went down hill stylingwise in the 1970s give me a conservatively styled car possibly with a bright exterior color like red or yellow for excitement that is an all around performer that is the car that stands the test of time for the average person now if only i could afford an m3 or m5 a debadged 03 m5 is the ultimate as it can stomp the hades out of most cars\\x85 could it be that stomping the hades out of other cars is also another way of seeking attention dealing with our insecurities validating ourselves no the term headturner means you want people to notice the car you want comments you want to be noticed this is the precise reason i hate owning a bmw like many other makes its got a reputation  a bad one  for being driven by uppity people seeking attention i think youre being too judgmental and not sufficiently appreciative of esthetics lots of people including myself enjoy and appreciate beautiful things i spend money redesigning the interior of my house bc i enjoy living in a beautiful home every time i see a beautiful woman i always take a look bc i like looking at beautiful women when i see a beautiful car for example the upcoming ford mustang is just gorgeous imo i turn my head because i enjoy looking at it because someone is in a headturner car doesnt necessarily mean that he is craving attention it could just be that person genuinely enjoys and gets pleasure out of the look of his car and why do you care what people think of other bmw owners as long as you enjoy driving it to hell with what others think give me a conservatively styled car possibly with a bright exterior color like red or yellow for excitement that is an all around performer that is the car that stands the test of time for the average person now if only i could afford an m3 or m5 alright riez at least we agree on the m5 the sporty quality of red and yellow and prudent maintenance habits  the metal on the cts screams pay attention to me yes it does unfortunately its the ugly duckling of the entry level luxo crowd unlike a bmw which just quietly sits it its corner and says look at me im handsome the bmw doesnt scream it gets noticed through its timeless styling hey do you want redpurple spike hair caddy or slickedback greysilver hair bmw is debadging a model name on the trunk lid another way of seeking attention ive never understood why people debadge their vehicles cant people be happy with want they have btw an m5 is easy to spot by the quad exhaust side gills and the front fascia that autospies link is a photoshop of an opel someone on fa said  look at the interior of both of these cars through the windshield as well as the apillar detail what sold me was the little horizontal line that is reflecting light in the rear seat area of both cars \\ncompare with httpwwwultimatecarpagecomlarge17492jpg opel presented the insignia an automotive vision of the future and a design study with a new formal concept for the first time at the frankfurt international motor show september 13 to 21 2003 the person who started this thread on jun 17 i feel surprised enlightened and thankful 150 all at the same time i am surprised that the topic elicited such heated discussion everyone could have simply said 147go away \\x85 you146re blasphemous to have raised the issue you just don146t understand148 i am also enlightened and thankful because i have learned a lot by reading the responses there is one thing i would like to clarify 150 while i can understand that this may be an issue of insecurity for some 150 it is not that way for me i am a secure person and i know what drives no pun intended my needs when i use the term 147head turning148 i refer to the simple enjoyment and excitement one feels as she drives a vehicle that is so attractive that people146s heads turn my dilemma is \\x85on one hand i feel very proud to be at a point in my life where i have a choice among the brands lexus bmw infinity cadillac acura etc of automobiles whose owners have included some of my mentors on the other hand i feel bored resistant and unfulfilled when i think of advancing to a class whose vehicles are bland common and cookiecutter in their outward appearance the very manufacturers of these automobiles demonstrate their recognition of the problem by their attempts to change 150 ref bmw146s bangle cadillac146s stealth theme etc additionally owners on this discussion board and among those with whom i have spoken demonstrate by their heated dialogue that the issue is alive and unresolved my hope is that when this discussion concludes everyone gains from it i know i have gained tremendous insight thank you i dont understand the desire to be stealth unless you happen to race people alot on a daily basis ive driven a 94 mustang gt for 7 years so ive never been one to try to impress other people with my car but as soon as i get my 330i with performance package you wont find me removing the badge or swapping out those awesome 18 inch wheels for some boring 17s to go stealth i think its okay to want people to like your cars looks its a big purchase so wanting some turned heads doesnt make a person pathetic in my opinion could it be that stomping the hades out of other cars is also another way of seeking attention dealing with our insecurities validating ourselves nope its like carrying a nuclear weapon you know if push comes to shove youve got the means to finish off anything that gets started beyond that for road trips nothing beats a car that can cruise in the 90s or 100s with ease i spend money redesigning the interior of my house bc i enjoy living in a beautiful home i do that to up the resale value in fact im about to add 200 sq ft to my house for more than aestheticswhen homes are going fo over 400sq ft you can see the roi is debadging a model name on the trunk lid another way of seeking attention ive never understood why people debadge their vehicles cant people be happy with want they have actually its common in europe as people think its ostentatious to have the badge of the car on display id remove mine but the car is a lease btw an m5 is easy to spot by the quad exhaust side gills and the front fascia no gills on the 03 and earlier m5s thats something bmw has added to the 3 and next gen m5 bummer as for the quad tail pipesmost people couldnt tell if the car that sat in front of them at a light had 1 2 or 20 pipes i dont understand the desire to be stealth unless you happen to race people alot on a daily basis why not just a desire to go unnoticed cheerioboy26\\x85\\ngood spot yeah i do remember that opel and definitely liked it i find it amazing how good concept cars never make it to production i would also say the other guy is an excellent photoshop artist i think there is enough talent out there that is worth seeking then again auto manufacturers have to work on their decision making i have to believe they just turn chicken and perceive many concepts as too radical and i am not convinced they are using focus groups scientifically hence effectively its hard to say though because they are very protective of such information jazevado\\x85\\ni think stealth has mostly to do with speed laws avoiding the man also there is a modesty factor151being enthusiastic about performance driving without pounding ones chest like jason kidd laying up instead of having to slam dunk on a breakaway i appreciate flashy cars but theres something tantalizingly sexy about an m5 like a gorgeous woman whose beauty cant be hidden by conservative clothing and lack of makeup she dont know shes beautiful\\nshe aint that kind sammy kershaw blueguy\\x85\\nyeah i like the idea of debadging it annoys me when cigar smokers leave the label on especially the ones who smoke them routinely some guys just seem to wear a sign that says look at me im smoking a cohiba a while back i played golf with some guy who had questionable social skills the words came unedited from his brain straight to his mouth out of no where he tells me take the label off your cigar usually i do but i just happened to forget in a rush to get to the tee i laughed and told him sorry you are very right actually it was a refreshing encounter i guess theres something to be said about candor and i never forgot to take a label off after that actually i stopped smoking them for quite some time talk about things that arent the same anymore blueguy\\x85yeah i like the idea of debadging it annoys me when cigar smokers leave the label on okay that answers that question im not sure why i like it but i do a boxster passed me the other day not one thing on it to give you a clue no porsche crest on the hood as near as i could tell no crests on the wheels and absolutely nothing on the rear it was just a very cool car it is the anti gold package regards\\nkyfdx i must be like you im not into the gold package offered by a lot of the japanese company if you want to be seen the shape and body of the car should speak for itself concerning the boxster it seems like everything on the car is an option great car to drive but pricey imo a cars line should still be fresh 5 years down the road and not be seen as the latest fad it seems like the a4 3series and the cclass will age gracefully while the cts and possibly the g35 will need new body work not sure about the tl a vehicle that expresses my personal preference for colour handles  performs well and has longterm reliability how anyone else views it is beyond tertiary when i look at my car assuming its something i really like as opposed to something i can barely tolerate theres a visceral difference particularly when it comes time to get another that bland business tends to dilute emotions of this sort bottom line the vast majority of the people who acquire cars in this class have no concept of performance or any of the other things that edmunds people find so important those of us here are a vocal but completely irrelevant minority would that it were not so very interesting discussion about styling i initially thought the cts was the ugliest thing to hit the road while the car still isnt a classically good looking car in my book they did nail the proportions the only thing left to do with the next generation is to smooth out some of the harsh lines and sharp points i dont like cars that look as though they will cut your hands if you try to feel the sheetmetal they may have done just that smooth out the edgessharpness with the 2005 sts but the theme may not work as well on a larger car ill have to see the sts in person to determine that it is now official i love the look of the new chrysler 300c i saw a few of these this past weekend rolling in a sea of forgettable boring car this car really stands out it looks like a pure gangsta car through and through i dont know where everyone else lives but in the chicago area this is the hottest car on the street right now everyone one from older couples to young fill in the blank wannabes adore desire and are buying this car this is bold american styling at its best i love it with a srt8 version coming and awd they may keep the sales going for quite a while i dont have to tell you how bad chrysler needed a hit bmw not sure what to say here other than that theyve probably ruined one of the top 5 most recognizable design languages in all of cardom i still at 3 years later detest the 7series the 5series is little better especially in darker colors but it still gets smoked by the eclass in styling the 6series if there ever was a car whos whole look was ruined by one element that big old square nonpermissible content removed bmw really better ask themselves about what they want for the 2006 3series the acura tl comes so close to being a styling star but no cigar contrived and messy styling imo that character line and those side sills dont work together dealers here are adding protective strips right below that charater line creating a true mess factory mud flaps yuck honda it seems is destined to style every 4door car they make like some variation of an accord witness the 2005 rl giant accord the tsx remains the best looking acura imo im slightly worried about a company that seemingly could do no wrong when it came to styling audi theyre going to put the new grille on everything by 2006 not sure about that i liked the new grille design on the a8l w12 but ive yet to see the new a6 and facelifted a4 careful the current a6 had no styling rival in its class until the 2003 e appeared imo the 19982004 was just perfect in that sense to me nissan is hit or miss stylistically now the maxima is a mess inside and out the murano and quest are messes inside either cheap or just plain weird the altima was good looking in 2002 but has since blended in nothing tops the passat in the family segment in styling for me just a few thoughts m ive always thought that bmw mercedes and audi did the conservative but handsome thing better than anyone else all three have had their high points with this them arguably with audi and mercedes at least now being most successful with it since bmw has gone off in another direction with their latest cars vws touareg and phaeton are just so classically handsome to me volvos always kinda wore their functionality first until now the styling was drawn and shaped around the safety cage m nice post merc 2431 a thought just occurred to me regarding the 300c i think its ugly but its not flaky ugly rather its funky ugly giving it appeal ever watch a butcher grind chopmeat i cant help but picture chopmeat coming out of that grille also if it ever needs replacement no problem just pick up any highway sewer grid and bolt it on man the steely stare of that grille is something else bewildering in its simplicity and lack of sophistication 300c in a nutshell151yeah just gimme a big ol car with 4 wheels style whats that imo a cars line should still be fresh 5 years down the road and not be seen as the latest fad it seems like the a4 3series and the cclass will age gracefully while the cts and possibly the g35 will need new body work not sure about the tl the g body work is being incorporated into the new and quite stunning m45 its safe to say that those design lines will be with us for a while thank god like the cts the g35 is different and not like its euro competitors thats where opinions differ some think if it aint like what im used to from bavaria then it cant be good and then there are those of us who want to look different and unlike what people want and expect some not really caring about what the car says as long as when theyi look at thier 3545k car it looks beautiful to themme just like your wifeother you are the one who has to live with it so you better like it apparently enough people go against the euro brainwashing of what a car should look like that both the g and the cts are considered wild sucesses if they didnt sell them they wouldnt restyle the entire lineups to look like them dam straight blueguymany people here have issues admitting they just like to stomp on it once in a while and see what shes got compared to the other guy several generations of enthusiasm come from just that little ego boost of passing a snot nosed _________ driver who got under your skin on the highway were not all ashamed to admit it at leastwhy else do we need near 300 hp cars that go 155 to get to the hospital in an emergency pleeeeeeeeze itts to nuke the other guy when he deserves it i initially thought the cts was the ugliest thing to hit the road merc  it was and still is although ive warmed up to the styling of the g35 as i said previously i liked the new designs of the new bmw out of the gate especially the 645 which is a gorgeous car inside and out i like the new styling of audi  the old ouchdi never did anything for me i am looking at a used 1993 318i for my wife it has high mileage 150k but was well taken care of its a 5speed i would like to know if these wereare reliable vehicles and what to look for before buying what are some of the weak points of the car are these interference engines i know they use timing chains not belts but how often should these chains be replaced anything special that i should take a close look because of know failures anything in particular that is very expensive to fix that i should look at also to make sure its not going to need replacing soon any comments and opinions ae welcome and appreciated thanks\\ntodd a 150000 mile bmw as a reliable car  not even a honda accord is that reliable at 150k unless well taken care of if you want a high mileage car that is reliable only a couple things come to mind honda toyota acura i initially thought the cts was the ugliest thing to hit the road merc  it was and still is although ive warmed up to the styling of the g35   kdshapiro has obviously never seen a pontiac aztek  now thats an ugly vehicle the cts is somthing i have loved the styling of since the first time i saw one in a mag kdshapiro has obviously never seen a pontiac aztek  now thats an ugly vehicle yes but we are talking entry level luxury performance sedans not cars in general i was thinking of getting a japanese sport sedan to replace my saab because the japanese cars seem to have better reliablity cheaper price and more horsepower but everything changed couple weeks ago my wife was driving a 93 on a 5lane highway suddently a construction truck changed lanes without making any signal the truck ran into the driver side of our 93 the 93 spinned around from the right to the left finally the back of the car hit the median wall and stopped everyone was surprised my wife was ok at that time the doctor from the er asked my wife what kind of car she drove my wife said a saab then the doctor said oh you should be ok my sisterinlaw got a saab too they are very safe she came home on the same day if she were driving in a japanese car she probably stayed in the hospital for weeks although the major damages were on the drive side doors and the trunk the insurance company decided to write off the car maybe its too expensive to fix the frame here is the link of the pictures httpf2pgphotosyahoocomlo_kenny there is no paint came off from the car i didnt see any paint came off from the car for my 3 years of ownership saab must put good paint on it not like the hondas we looked at the internet and found that most saab owners who lost their cars in an accident ended up byuing another saab both my wife and i feel more secure in buying european cars because they perform real life crash test not those inhouse lab tests we shopped around and ended up buying another saab  a 95 aero we just love it now we have a car with both good performance and good safety rating i dont talk about exterior aesthetics much since its so subjective but here goes the es is a bit funky and the is looks like a japanimation toy the 3 is the most boring car in the group some say its understated elegance i just see plainness kinda reminds me of a guppy from the front for some reason the c just looks disproportioned to me odd since theres definitely a resemblance to the s and i consider the s to be the best looking sedan ever so far the front of the g35 is a bit funky the profile is kinda boring the rear i like the tl has good proportions and i think it looks good from most angles it almost looks too carved though like something that the transformers would transform into i like the 300c it says power presence uniqueness it aint what i call pretty but i like it nonetheless interesting visuals about the 300c i think sometimes good design is just plain and simple and it doesnt need to follow certain rules or dos and donts the 300c is just a refreshing design from a freeway choked with boring as hell lookalike cars for that in my book it gets applause r34 both my wife and i feel more secure in buying european cars because they perform real life crash test not those inhouse lab tests ive always said this was the case and the europeans have known this for years saabs volvos mercedes and audi especially add renault to that list also m 300c nice tl ugly i have always felt that european cars protect their occupants in real world crashes especially mercedes and bmw i dont talk about exterior aesthetics much since its so subjective because aesthetics are so subjective it is all the more reason to talk about it furthermore i believe you did an excellent job of it in your post i have always felt that european cars protect their occupants in real world crashes especially mercedes and bmw of course the stats say otherwise the 3 series is downright lousy  3 stars out of 5  in side impact crashes nhtsacom the idea the euro cars are safer in crashes a myth fabricated by the pr departments of mb volvo audi et al they do their damnedest to convince us their vaultlike cars are so safe visavis the japanese and american comeptition total rubbish regarding the 3series tests bmw is at odds with the nhtsa and their testingscoring procedure if i remember correctly bmw claims that the test that the nhtsa uses is not a good real world test and as such many bmws dont do too well on that test from bmws perspective they have engineered their cars to be safer in what they consider to be true real world crashes and the nhtsa be damned who is correct i dont really know that said it takes some moxie to deliberately engineer a car that does not do well in the nhtsa tests as such im inclined to think that my bmw is more than safe enough best regards\\nshipo of course the stats say otherwise the 3 series is downright lousy  3 stars out of 5  in side impact crashes nhtsacom but i know several people who have been in accidents had their bmws totaled and walked away there are those of course who havent have been so fortunate as people in the safest of cars according to the nhtsa are killed of course you could say that about all cars but i am sold and i believe i have a better chance of survival in a 3 series than lets say an altima or maxima laboratory procedures dont tell what happens when a car going 65 is rearended by a bus i dont know about which one is best but wouldnt we all feel pretty good being in any mid size sedan developed in the last 57 years or so volvo is no better and neither are bmw and merc physics are physics mass is mass and frame designs are reverse engineered and stolen from each other or improved the volvo marketing thing where the cars were boxy but good not long ago was genius and still makes them money emotional brand attachment  priceless but i know several people who have been in accidents had their bmws totaled and walked away lets not go to inane anecdotes as my grandfather would quickly step up and say he knew people who had been thrown from a car in an accident and walked away fine thus he wouldnt wear a safety belt great so some people get by on dumb luck if i have to choose between believing the nhtsa and bmw regarding crash worthiness the nhtsa gets my vote every day and twice on sunday bmw has a reason to lie to us  theyre here to sell us products and protect their fragile brand identity im not a big fan of govt bureaus but when it comes to safety i dont believe one word coming from any corporationespecially the automobile world i own mazda toyota nissan and saabs before i think nissan may be ok but i dont have much faith on toyota honda or suzuki knock on the doors and you will know what i mean of course the japanese improved their cars a lot but most of their cars were not built for autobann driving of course you can drive them to 100mph but you will not feel safe in those cars in that speed i found they are not as stable as european cars on highway speed european cars give me better feel from and better control on the roads too for saab they built huge mechanic mooses for their own crash test i just feel safe in a saab volvo is famous for their safety too even though i dont have much interest on their cars my friend has a jetta and her car was rearended by a japanese sedan there were only few scratches on the bumper of the jetta but there were significant damages on the japanese car i like to pay less for more horsepower and better reliability but how good can it be if you cannot survive in an accident  i am willing to pay more for europeans or maybe i am getting old the jetta accident means nothing in fact the car the crumples more usually front ends are meade to seriously crumple is the one i want id rather the car crumple than me of course the japanese improved their cars a lot but most of their cars were not built for autobann driving of course you can drive them to 100mph but you will not feel safe in those cars in that speed i found they are not as stable as european cars on highway speed european cars give me better feel from and better control on the roads too have you driven a tl or g35 the japanese figured it out finally a g35 at 120 is much like my soon to be sis in laws bmw 530 at 120 or so very rigid and stable of course a smooth highway is not stability check id personally take a g35 with sports suspension  hell an altima over the new 93 in an accident the epsilon platform from gm doesnt strike me as being autobahn worthy any more than any accord id gamble if you drove a g35 on the autobahn youd walk away a believer im not sure where this myth that euro cars are safer than japanese cars comes from actually i guess we do where it comes from a few years ago my brother was involved in an accident where the his vehicle flipped twice and was totaled amazingly the only injury he suffered was a slight bruise to his head it was a japanese car he was damn lucky id say doesnt really mean that japanese cars are inherently safer than german cars depends more on each vehicle im inclined to trust nhtsa and iihs more than what bmw or any other manufacturer says not that nhtsa and iihs are infallible but better than what a manufacturer or a few anecdotes say i stupidly rear ended someone about 3 months ago and i can confirm that a saab 93s front crumples a lot collision happened about 15 mph and caused 1800 damage to his bumper and i dealt with a 10000 repair to the then undrivable saab my air bag didnt even go off it crumpled so well sorty to hear of your astronomically costly misfourtune i hope the airbags dont go off ever if not 3540 mph at time of impact a guy in his g flew off a ravine and walked away after 12 trees stopped him and he claimed the airbags didnt go off from impact not being consistent with normal collision feedback i guess they really got the latest generation of airbags down they used to go off for anything and cost 5k to repair  wonder if spitzer looked into that lol unfortuanately all the technology in crumple zones means it wont take much impact to make it look horrific and cost a lot to repair i guess the insurance co would rather pay for a new car than for a new you as would you or i the g has one of the worst slow speed accident costs for a 5 mph crash but that all seems forgiven when looking at offset frontal and real world accidents ive seen pics of the shell around the g passenger seems to be quite well built and i like the extra head room away from the a and b pillars that you dont get with the smaller cars like a 3 or 93 being 65 i am at much more risk of injury from my own interior caving around my head and knees than mostand the extra room doesnt suck either i was with a friend helping her look for a car on a test drive she asked the salesperson about how safe the vehicle is in a crash his response i havent heard anyone complain eye roll i shot back of course not theyre dead actually i knew the car had great ratings but i just love the way salesguy lie and say silly stuff not sure there is such a thing as a completely unbiased assessment but consumer reports does publish their safety assessment they look at 1 active and 2 passive safety and 3 average the published crash test results here are there 2004 rankings in order for upscale and large sedans excellent\\n1 is300\\n2 cclass\\n3 a4\\n4 95\\n5 330i\\n6

they only have an assessment for models that have both iihs offsetcrash test results and either frontal or sidecrash results from nhtsa i dont know about bmw but youd have to be living on another planet not to see the real world safety benefits of mercedes volvo saab and even audi it is no secret that bmw just recently say like in the last 1015 years really got serious about safety but the rest have proven their worth in realworld crashesespecially volvo and mercedes theyve been collecting data on their wrecked cars in real world accidents in europe for over 40 years and youre telling us that all of this reasearch puts them on or at the same level as companies like gm or ford in safety these two in particular dont even know where to put gas tanks in their cars or trucks id really like to see your status if a cclass or s40 gets hit by an suv compared to a focus or cavalier or civic these lab tests are silly in the fact that they are controlled and very predictable since when is a real world accident predictable and controlled companies like mb and volvo were doing safety engineering before any of these us test organizations had a clue amazingly now the nhtsa wants makers to address rearend impacts and the affects it has on seats only about 20 years after volvo and mercedes solved the problem these same safey regs give american cars that have headrests important in a rear collision that rests in the small of your back and dont come anywhere near protecting your actual head a five star safety rating a kia is now as safe as a volvo ok right there are pictures all over the net of mercedes and volvos that have been completely demolished up to the apillar and the glass didnt even break id like to see anything from japan or american do this the current acura rl bent up like an accordian in the last round of testing it was subjected to the car literally broke after the apillar not before it m take a look at the nhtha video of the g35 sedan offset frontal crash test this may be the most worthwhile of all lab tests it certainly gives the analyst and manufacturer something to go on as the offset high speed is one of the more devestating impacts some may think its crap but i think it saves lives as it gives terrific data to the makers just the last 10 years alone have seen dramatic changes for car shell design not to mention all the airbag and driver assist technologys not sure where the video is  here are the results httpwwwhwysafetyorgvehicle5fratingscehtml0307htm theres your crumpled to the apillar with no windows broken shot on the right this car is a best pick youll notice as well volvo schmolvothey are all pretty good in this classfocus civics and cavaliers  why are those in here with merc1 on this the us simply doesnt have the driving environment to find out what happens in highspeed accidents on a regular basis which is probably a good thing given how most drive that plus the litigious nature of american society means that giving a wrecked car back to the manufacturer for analysis isnt a highly likely event im with merc as well  the europeans were concerned with car safety was ford was still trying to place the gas tank on the pinto for the best possible explosion japanese cars of the 70s and early 80s were also a joke today in 2004 a lot of work has been done to even the playing field but the point is the europeans especially mercedes were dealing with this issue more seriously than anyone else there are pictures all over the net of mercedes and volvos that have been completely demolished up to the apillar and the glass didnt even break id like to see anything from japan or american do this the current acura rl bent up like an accordian in the last round of testing it was subjected to the car literally broke after the apillar not before it visit an imprezza forum those nutjobs wrap their cars around everything and somehow that tinnylittle econo cars passenger cage is fine over and over sorry i dont buy into the hype about european cars being safer than other cars and the most specific target of such claims japanese cars ive been tboned before while in a vw golf truck smacked us at 40 mph and walked away fine the energy of the crash was absorbed around the passenger cell at the time i though wow look how safe these german cars are but after really looking into it i cant say the results would have been much different if wed been in a civic or corolla probably different in a bimmer as side protection is crap but other small cars seemed to fair fine in side collisions buy into the marketing thats fine i dont for a second believe an mb or volvo is head and shoulders safer than any other late model japanese luxury brand i dont give a hoot what mb did safety wise in 1970 80 90 doesnt matter to me the cars made today by most luxury makes  bmw accepted  appear to have leveled the playing field to the point that declaring mb safer by virtue of its history just seems incredibly bias i dont give a hoot what mb did safety wise in 1970 80 90 matters to me and i dont buy into the marketing just into what they did why would mbs actions in the 70s 80s and 90s matter to you now unless you own one of their cars from those eras its irrevelent please dont babble about how nobody would have done it then bah theres nothing new under the sun simply variations if honda hadnt been first out with their vtec somebody else would have come out with their version 147bah theres nothing new under the sun simply variations148 bad attitude chuck dickens would never approve the internet is new and you don146t have to dig hard to find other things\\x85 oh and yes\\x85 do do do do dooooooooo\\x85 i got a new attitude patti labelle please dont babble about how nobody would have done it then bah arent we all babbling some more than others  there was a vast difference in the german cars of the 70s80s and the japanese and american cars german cars were built like tanks japanese cars were built like tunafish cans but we digress and i agree this has nothing to do the comparo between a 3 series and a g35 im with blueguy here i really dont see any valid backing behind the notion that european cars are safer than japanese cars in the same class mercedes were better in the 70s in fact mercedes was infinitely better than infiniti back then just like yesterday lease rates dont mean squat neither do yesteryears cars unless you drive them an airbag alone makes any car better than anything out there in the 70s how safe was a mercedes sl convertible when a 71 coupe de ville with out a crumple zone came head on into it i guues no safer than me when a hummer h1 comes 4 wheeling over my g theres your crumpled to the apillar with no windows broken shot on the right this car is a best pick youll notice as well volvo schmolvothey are all pretty good in this classfocus civics and cavaliers  why are those in here your video is of a controlled test means nothing on the highway at 65mph if you visit germancarfanscom youll see mercedes and other european cars like volvo and saab that have been crashed in anything but a controlled whitecoated engineers watching situations and their passenger cells are intact my problem with these test is that some car markers are probably designing their cars to pass these test only with real world concerns going out the window why are civics in here someone is suggesting that all cars are just about equal when it comes to safety why should it matter if they cost a lot or if theyre cheaper models arent people who buy cavaliers and focuses entitled to safety too blueguydotcom my point about the acura rl is that it failed a crash test and it supposed to be acuras top car meaning that not all luxury car are created equal in terms of safety im not shocked that you dont care about what mercedes or volvo did in the name of safety back in the day long as you know that the car youre driving now benefited from what they did crumple zone engineering didnt just fall from the sky youre suggesting that all the research these companies did years before anyone else had clue puts them merely equal with companies that didnt even care about safety 1015 years ago not even to suggest that mb or volvo is safer because of what they did in the past if you check into insurance data in europe on european cars youll see where volvo renault mercedes and others have proven they are safer than the majority of japanese cars it is well documented that mercedes volvo and porsche in particular addressed certain safety issues like rear impacts before toyota honda gm ford even began to research the problem now the government is going to set a standard years and years after the hard work was done by you know who but im to believe that corolla is as safe a volvo or mercedes ok m sure id much rather be in a mb or volvo over a corolla in the event of an accident a higher priced sedan will probably have more mass structural rigidity and safety equipment what is relevant are euro vs japan cars in the same class havent really seen any evidence that the 3 c saab and volvo are any safer than the tl g35 es or is or that the s and 7 are any safer than the ls or the q or that the x5 and ml are safer than the rx mdx or fx while european car manufacturers are to be commended for their early lead in car safety i care only about the car i am buying today if we use history to determine who was first we should all be driving fords because they were first with the assembly line and we would expect it to be perfected by now i do give credit to ford for the assembly line but i am not ready to buy a ford because of it my problem with these test is that some car markers are probably designing their cars to pass these test only with real world concerns going out the window why are civics in here someone is suggesting that all cars are just about equal when it comes to safety why should it matter if they cost a lot or if theyre cheaper models arent people who buy cavaliers and focuses entitled to safety too  first the cavialiers and civics and corolla that are much smaller than the mid size sedan volvos and mercs  these cars arent even comparable on thier own they have some great cars at that smaller class level where its inherently more dangerous in certain types of impact second if you think real world cars arent better because something cant be gleaned from slamming half a car into a block wall at 45 in offset fashion then you might just assume that you will only be in other more friendly kinds of accidents there are few more tragic impacts than head on offset frontal you need to know what happens at 45 which is a major impact before a car can become a protective shell at 65 a merc c class more safer than a g or maxima  horse puckey actually seeing what happens in a controlled setting while the car rips apart up to the passengers knees and head is probably the reason gs may be safer than the volvo mercedes and 3 series i havent seen any reason to believe i should buy into the pioneers marketing campaigns  all safety technology has been pertty reverse engineered if not shared and everyone uses everyone elses ideasits why there are so many great safe cars buy a chrysler if that emotion stirs your decision making it was iaccoca that demanded airbags and did major groundbreaking in his labs for the technology to come to market the safest cars to be in are the accords and camarys based on real data can someone help me remember where i read this a month or so ago  it may have been related to recent press about the rollover ratings ill post if i find it the article stated that a lithe sedan is way less dangerous than any suv for rolling over which is the more deadly variety of accident also the drivers that buy conservative sedans may be part of the correlation if you really want to be safe a volvo will make you feel good before the accident thanks to the marketing but ill not feel any safer since i know my car has more ability to avoid some accidents better than any car in class thanks to its handling edge and if impact does happen i should do as well its compeitors my problem with these test is that some car markers are probably designing their cars to pass these test only with real world concerns going out the window i dont really believe this but i absolutely agree that simulating an accident is not the same as being in one if it were people wouldnt be killed at very low speed collisions when test notice it is test data data suggest a driver in the very same car can walk away from a 40mph frontal collision you can be killed in a 4mph crash  hit a plumbing truck with copper tubing hanging out the back or a ladder everything that can go wring cant be simulated figureing out what can happen in the most gruesome of accident types is a good start to an always evolving process plenty of people have griven japanese cars into barriers at 90 and lived and plenty of volvo owners died in under 40 crashes ask an engineer what these tests showapparently enought to make cars safer at an exponentially faster rate than when nader was doing it all i think any crash test real world or otherwise only helps the people driving cars to survive a collision better any test than no test however offset frontal crashes are a little contrived you have an immovable object portraying the other vehicle while in the real world that other vehicle probably also has crumple zones etc i think most japanese cars advertised their cars to be reliability and have great value like toyota  honda sometimes they mentioned good safety rating but i dont think that is their main focus for some european manufacturers like volvo  saab they have been famous for safety and they focus on safety a lot for a long time as i mentioned before please knock on the doors on a japanese car and then the doors on an european car or maybe an american car too you can tell the latter is more solid the later usually has much more heavy doors too just think it simple throw an egg and a stone may not be that extreme but it is just an example to the wall which one will have fewer damages  i feel european cars are safety just based on my experience i dont even want to mention the accident my mom had with her corolla i think most japanese midsize cars are safe but no as safe as europeans for civic and corolla or tercelecho i doubt you can walk out with minor injury after a highway accident they are famous for good milage and value i got so many friends driving small japanese cars in canada and us and i dont think those small cars can protect you that well in highway accident in city they may be ok i have more faith on nissan better paint and seems to be more solid than honda and toyota better paint and seems to be more solid than honda and toyota i disagree with that statement ive owned several toyotas hondas and nissans by far the worse paint job honor belongs to nissan in my book toyotas have the best well the paint on my latest honda is nothing short of crappy but that is the first one of eight that ive had a problem with but regarding solidity every honda that ive owned felt like a tank compared to the two nissans especially with interior trim and switchgear shifters etc while the nissans were mechanically reliable they just felt cheap to me regards\\nkyfdx thats strange i heard many people complaint about the honda paint i owned a 1995 nissan altima before and its paint was much better than my neighbours accord 1998 model i found the altima interior was quiet good at that time not as strange as todays there may be no true way to know if a volvo is safer than a honda my v70 and tsx are both toprated in govt tests but drive them backtoback and guess which one feels more secure basically i think theyre both be very safe  and i feel very well protected in each of them i do however place a lot of value in volvos history of safety research testing and pioneering new technologiesdevices whips sips etc today as in the past volvo devotes a great deal of its resources into safety research and the result is they are typically among the first to introduce groundbreaking new safety features other car companies adopt this technology a couple years later and all cars on the road get safer and safer year after year i never bought into the volvo marketing machine eitherthat is until i test drove and ultimately purchased a volvo and after my wifes horrible offset frontal crash last may im a believer now my point about the cavs and civics is that they arent on the same level as a luxury car when it comes to safety but it was suggested here than every car is equal nowadays because gm and honda can just buy a benz or volvo and tear it apart and engineer all their cars in the same manner also a cclass or s40 are similar in size to a corolla or civic i garuantee a cclass or s40 will come out better than any other comparably sized car camrys and accord being the safest cars is the horse puckey imo there is no way either of these are as safe as a midsize or large volvo or mercedes or even a saab 95 have you seen saabs safety tests for the 95 in which they meet offset at 75mph honda and toyota wouldnt dare attempt this you need to know what happens at 45 which is a major impact before a car can become a protective shell at 65 my point exactly and why would they care about a 65 mph crash if they only have to pass the test at 45 nissan is not a safety driven company like volvo or mercedes or saab and with all the cheapining theyve been doing do you really think theyve thought any further about safety past government tests i seriously doubt it a crash at 45 mph is serious enough but when you add another 20 mph to the game youre basically talking a whole new level of danger with a corresponding level of engineering needed nissan in particular aint been burning no midnight oil on this m also a cclass or s40 are similar in size to a corolla or civic i garuantee a cclass or s40 will come out better than any other comparably sized car  the mercedes c class is an entry lux sedan a civic is a compact car weiging less while being smaller and having less equipment smaller engine of course a c class will trample a civic it weighs as much as a g or more hello a hummer will crush a blazer no one said all cars are equal but i did say all cars in our class are very equal ill take a corolla againt any similar sized car what the h do you think this is a tank battle its not about who crushes who  too much monster truck shows there bud when a s40 collides with a corrola both cars would probably fare equally frame wise the volvos true advantage is inside where the multiple side and pillar airbags are that corollas may not have it may also be an advanced tcs and vdc system that corollas in the economy class donesnt have if you think you can front on these two cars and the volvos going to look better or protect better assuming theya re the same weight 0 they are not becasue of miracle steel or welds that no one ever heard of then spend all the extra money some people also belive gmcs are better than chevy cause of better steel too and the division makes so much it was denied being shut down and folding back into chevy marketing whats the big deal with 65 vs 45 do you really know whats best for engineers designing cars no its easy to make tests have 65 mph as national standard but most cars would be demolished  while our class would benefit the rest of the smaller 75 cars on the market would be scrap after an offset frontal at that speed the problem with a national standard as thos tries to be is that its crap for an array of car styles and sizes nissan burning midnight oilisnt that a band save your preaching  my g is rigid as they come has 7 airbags all the electronic driver assists better handling and better accident avoidance than any volvo because of its handling which is more important than seems to be apparent volvo shmolvo i am going to be looking at the acura tl and the volvo s40 and was wondering if anyone had some\\nfeedback on either car i think im starting to understand why 90 of men love the three stooges yet 70 of women hate them its true men are from mars women are from venus indeed it is starting to get very enlightening around here nyuk yuk yuk and now back to our regularly scheduled topic both my daughter and i love the three stooges while my son and wife dont there you have it folks a sophisticatedpseudoscientific sampling of four persons showing 50 either way  best regards\\nshipo i loathe the three stooges chaplin and all phsyical comedy most jim carrey most peter sellers jeez what a shock and let me guess rebel without a cause is one of your alltime favorites  tasdisr\\nthese are the exact 2 cars i compared when i was looking for a new car safety was a primary concern for me along with reliability i drove a volvo s40 t5 exactly 2 days after the lot got its first 20045 s40 i like the looks of the s40 except for the avalon type roof lines on the front and rear profile which really turns me off it seemed to have plenty of pep for a 4 cylinder not too much turbo lag however i did not feel comfortable in the drivers seat the placement of the console and the view from the drivers seat just didnt seem right for some reason also the rear seat is quite uncomfortable for average passengers i am only 6 ft tall and sitting in the back seat my head was touching the head liner and my legs were hard against the front seats that same day i test drove an acura tl and my search was over the tl felt more comfortable solid and faster the interior quality was much higher imo the interior space on the tl is much larger that the s40 after adding all the options i wanted to the s40 i was at the same price as the tl wo navigation which already had all those options after 4000 miles on the tl i have absolutely no regrets i do not think for a second that the volvo s40 is any safer to drive than the tl they both ranked the same in the insurance institute for highway safety frontal offset crash tests the tl ranked in the top position for midsized luxury cars and the s40 was in the top position for midsized moderately priced cars fyi the volvo s60 ranked last in the midsized luxury car category in this test you can complain all you want about controlled crash testing but to this date it is the only benchmark we have that ahem was funny i had a feeling wed be seeing you around today but before we get back to serious business i have to ask where you weigh in on the three stooges thats it now promise ill be good after all this is a very serious place    i might be from mars but i like to vacation in venus now back to cars latest stuff floating around bmw concerns the new 30 used in the upcoming 630i itll produce 250 hp but still the anemic torque rating of 221 or so argh that engine will be in the e90 3 series word is also coming that a turbo version will be around with 333 hp as the high end 330i before one jumps to an m3 with a v8 turbo if its small low pressure turbo thatll help the torquedeficiency problem of bmws overly praised inline 6 and someone asked about a favorite filmi see too many to ever narrow it down to one if i had to pick 5 the third man once were warriors cool hand luke or butch and sundance or the hustler out of sight and princess bride rebel without a cause  movie without a plot or decent acting rrorison\\nthanks for the feedback i am going to check them both out tomorrow\\ni already own a tl type s and it has been rock solid but i like the new style much better volvo just opened a dealership less than a mile so i thought being so close i would check the s40 out the mazda3 is basically a less dressy version of the s40 same basic car for less money with the money saved you could look into some simple mods for the 24 mazda drops into the car i know mazdas owners are crazy about tinkering one turbo could make the 3 an insanely fun little carhatch tasdisrplease share your feedback with us on your test drives and experience wait a sec im confused are we talking about the old movies of the 1940s or dubya carl rove and cheney someone mentioned volvo designed the whips safety device headrest  this made me think of something interested about saab i read some history of saab several weeks ago and found that certain ideasproducts were created by saab but everyone thought other manufacturers created them saab was the first one to came up with the followings 1 heated seat i thought it was mb or bmw\\n2 ventilatedcooling seat i thought it was mb\\n3 whips and headlight wipers\\n   i though it was volvo too 4 etcetc saab was one of the first car maker to build a production turbo car successfully i am not sure if saab was the first one but they were among the first group it seems that saab didnt do much in the marketing area to promote its unique features but some carmakers want you to believe they were the pioneer of certain features a carmaker ford  put a tv commerical several months ago said the cooling seat was one of their innovative ideas interesting true i just saw a nissan nearly split in two on the saw mill pky very little safety cage protection a pillar and b pillar virtually non existant hope the people inside are ok didnt see them can you say buy my e46 for residual value at lease end lol theres very little doubt in my mind that my e46 will not be worth nearly what the lease claims ive seen a mercedes and a lexus split cleanly into two different pieces on the road after the fact of course i dont know what happened to make that happen but these things really depend on the severity of the impact anyways anyone really know what the engine choices are for the next 3 ive read a 230hp to 250hp 30l and a 260hp to 290hp 35l i guess theyll be called the 330i and 335i then if true i can see the 330i outselling the 335i by more than 8 to 1 even right now the 325i outsells the 330i by 5 to 1 turbo if its small low pressure turbo thatll help the torquedeficiency problem of bmws overly praised inline 6 short of bumping up displacement or supercharging there isnt a lot that can be done to increase max torque 220ftlb to 230 ftlb sounds about right for a 30l engine one turbo could make the 3 an insanely fun little carhatch i think this car already exists  subaru sells it think this car already exists  subaru sells it no they dont they sell a plasticky econobox with a heavy and instrusive awd system heck theres still no sunroof or leather on the wrx it goes like stink beyond that here is the link of some real stories not test results httpwwwsaabnetcomtsnssl the one submitted by willie c on june 2000 was amazing saab focuses on a reallife safety philosophy of designing cars to be as safe as possible in realworld accident situations rather than just laboratory tests since 1972 saab has investigated more than 5000 accidents involving saabs in sweden the saab 95 has been subjected to more than 40 different crash test configurations including cartocar cartotruck and cartodummymoose of these only 11 are mandated by government standards for some reason the german cars have side marker lights on either the body or the side mirror while japanese and american luxury cars generally dont have this feature a few do though i find this feature invaluble when other cars are changing lanes its difficult to see the corner lights in the front of the merging car but if all cars had side maker lights im sure driving would be a bit safer why more cars dont have this inexpensive feature i dont know im actually kinda of suprised that my dads 96 volvo doesnt have this feature i just came back from my test drive of the tl and s40\\nthe s40s performance and handling were great fit and\\nfinish were excellent and the seats were very comfortable\\nthe sound system was impressive the seating position seems\\nmuch higher than in the tl and the overall ride was more\\ncomfortable than the tl the tls performance and handling were excellent again fit\\nand finish was great and seating was comfortable the ride was\\na little harsher than the s40 and harsher than my current tl types\\nthe sound system to me was hands down much more impressive than\\nthe volvo the seating was not as comfortable as the s40 but i preferred the seating position over the s40 overall i like the tl much more than the s40 the s40 was lacking in some areas such as very small door pockets for storage and a very\\nsmall console and center armrest the s40s door armrests were very narrow when compared to the tl they are both great cars but i definetly prefer the acura i would think the tsx and the s40 would be a fairer comparison closer in size price and power lenghtwise you are correct the s40 is about 10 inches shorter than\\nthe tl and has 218 hp compared to the tls 270 pricewise by the time\\nyou option the s40 out to be comparable to the tl the sticker price\\nis about the same the tl is 34650 and the s40 t5 with premium pkgconvenience pkg climate pkg dstc bixenon hlamps and moonroof\\nis 3506500 i dont care if it has a rocket booster under the hood who would possibly pay that for an s40 forget the tl for 35k i could list at least ten other cars to buy instead of the s40 for some reason the german cars have side marker lights on either the body or the side mirror while japanese and american luxury cars generally dont have this feature a few do though   i believe those side marker lights are required on cars sold in europe i toured the corvette factory in bowling green kentucky a few years back and noticed several new corvettes parked near the end of the line that had fender mounted side marker lights the guide said those were for export and those lights were needed 35k for a tl maybe with navi its a 33k car without it and i dont know how to outfit an s40 to hit 35k but i couldnt manage it on carsdirect the prices i listed were sticker prices not what the dealer\\nwas actually willing to sell the car for i checked on the tlits a 33k car without navi if youre comparing pricewise a navi equipped tl to an s40 without one thats not really apples and oranges i managed to get an s40 to 36k by adding every option radio pack with dvd navi 36k for a car thats platform is the same as the mazda3 thats what i thought too about it being mandated by eu but my father drives a 96 volvo 850t and it doesnt have the side marker lights i would have that volvo touted as a very safe car would have this extra safety feature ive had alfa romeos on my mind again lately once youve owned one they never really leave you and ran across this video while surfing the pacific northwest alfa romeo club website enjoy httpwwwnwalfaclubcomfeatureshtml pacific raceways is a terrific road course and the local porsche bmw audi and alfa clubs hold track events throughout the year lucky for me even acuras are invited for reference the group is tracking out of turn 3b when the video begins  the mercedes c class is an entry lux sedan a civic is a compact car weiging less while being smaller and having less equipment smaller engine of course a c class will trample a civic it weighs as much as a g or more hello a hummer will crush a blazer no one said all cars are equal you missed the point by a country mile i said that the c or s40 would come out in accident better not one between a cclass and a civic weight has very little to do with how safe the car is going to be tell that all the cops getting killed in their very heavy crown vics how the car is designed is more important than how heavy it is why the h do you think anyone said this was a tank battle who said anything who is going to crush who youre confused  whats the big deal with 65 vs 45 do you really know whats best for engineers designing cars no youre right i dont butt companies like volvo and mercedes and saab do theyve been doing just that for over 40 years 50 in the case of mb and volvo  its easy to make tests have 65 mph as national standard but most cars would be demolished  while our class would benefit the rest of the smaller 75 cars on the market would be scrap after an offset frontal at that speed sorry but this makes no sense to me problem is youre stuck on that test lab stuff an offset crash isnt the only type of accident you can have im not knocking the g35 but nissan has been very skimpy with their cars to get them to the market right now and there is no way ill believe that theyre just as safe as volvo saab or mercedes\\x85these companies while theyve had their problems in other areas have never compromised on safety now nissan is supposed to have matched them in an area they werent even an expert in during the time where theyre cutting cost at every possible area right gm cars feel solid too doesnt mean they are safe the crashtest failing acura rl feels solid too m but nissan has been very skimpy with their cars to get them to the market right now and there is no way ill believe that theyre just as safe as volvo saab or mercedes skimpy my amp the cars on the line right now have nissan at the height of the industry on just about every front including product quality profit in an oversupplied industry is just one indication that rushing to market is hogwash the g35 certainly wasnt rushed to market nor was the fx the z or the upcoming m45 you dont own the toughest class for 2 years running and put the competition into a tailspin with rushed to market cars and inferior design as for safety you know as much as i do about what the g will donada so until we know your speculation is as meaninglss as mine i know marketing wont save you neither will past research by some truly good companies that made safety a priority  typically euro makers if that makes you feel good about paying a premium for a volvo or bmw then pay away i managed to get an s40 to 36k by adding every option radio pack with dvd navi 36k for a car thats platform is the same as the mazda3 well it goes both ways one could say the tl is a 33k honda accord or a es330 is a 35k toyota camry although the s40 is priced in the same range as its competitors it order to beat them it needed to be priced lower imo thats where volvo failed just a little tidbit aside from its glowing crash ratings here in n america the g35  nissan skyline 350gt has scored one of the highest safety ratings in japanese crash tests it is considered one of the safest cars in japan no doubt id feel safe in one heres the link the 250gt is tested here httpwwwnasvagojpassesshtml2002eas125html imho the s40 doesnt compete with the tl it seems a class below in size and mission i would think the s60 is the tl competitor in volvos line i see the competition as a4 18\\n325i\\n93\\ntsx\\nis300 sorta\\nhonda accord ex depending on trim line\\nnissan altima\\ntoyota camry the last three are a little larger than the s40 but im sure are looked at as viable options as the s40 price climbs over 30k regards\\nkyfdx if that makes you feel good about paying a premium for a volvo or bmw then pay away yes it does make me feel good at least everyone feels good whether its to pay or not to pay the cars on the line right now have nissan at the height of the industry on just\\nabout every front including product quality bull theyve just sent 20 engineers to america to fix quality problems nissan also scored low on some recent surveys nobody said the g35 or fx were rushed to the market but the 350z has a cardboard interior if there ever was one in a car it is downright worse than some gm cars in interior quality as for safety you know as much as i do about what the g will donada so until we know your speculation is as meaninglss as mine partially correct i dont know about the g35 past the crash test scores but i do know who used to and still does place emphasis on safety and it isnt nissan m not sure about the american made ones but the japanese made cars seem fine many people pay many many mopre dollars and get some problems there is lexus and then there is everyone else take look at some other surveys like how much emotion about the brand or car image influenced the decision making it was just noted that nissan scored at the top despite some minor and major crank sensor recall quality issues people expect problems from thier cars if they are from mercedes or bmw  its part of the experience like it or not not everyone wants a camary so we deal with a rattle or a greasy window my dealer has fixed my minor annoyances well and i havent minded the 23 little issues since the car rocks so much as far as safety  your objective statments and cultish faithfulness to marketing aside unless you can point to engineering or proven technolgy in the supposed superior car from sweden or germany then i dont think the emotion of your willingness to pay a premium for a slower less agile car dont really matter as for the g nothing but a stellar safety record so far keep on paying the premium my friend ill be upgrading the ski boat every time i buy a car with the extra money i save as for the 350 z comments whatever its a carerra chaser for 27k it looks great to many many people who buy it in droves and praise it like a religious figure its a carerra chaser for 27k not even close people expect problems from thier cars if they are from mercedes or bmw  its part of the experience like it or not i dont know about you but when i shell out 30k i dont even want to hear the word problems for the next seven or so years all i want to do is regular maintenance service good luck with the expected problems with the g i made a bet with my wife if i got all a last year in my b school study i will go a head to buy the car i want now i won but i have trouble picking out the best sport sedan since i am in b school i know i should ask expert before the decision you guys should be the ones who provide such expertise my budget 35k priority 1 safety 2 reliability 3 performance yeah i only have one life and i don146t want to spend too much of my life at the service department at dealer146s constrain no japanese cars just a personal preference i know they make good cars  can you guys give me some suggestion thanks a lot peter the only way to do this is not to own a car 35kpriority 1 safety 2 reliability 3 performanceno japanese cars just forget this market then theres no such thing as a reliable european car bmw mb and audi are all lousy for reliability volvo and saab are a joke whats that leave jags simply a ford mondeo why not try the tl g35 tsx and is300 test driving a car doesnt mean you must buy it heck i loathe caddy yet i still gave their crummy cts a test drive i had to accept i could be wrong and really dig it i didnt want to buy a bmw still think theyre overpriced but ended up with one after a test drive of a 330i 6 speed try everything then start knocking off choices dismissing the car before driving it is ignorant at best at the worst youre keeping yourself from finding that car thats epiphanous for you and dont dismiss nonluxury makes because theyre not fitted with a stupid badge a wrx sti or a mazda6 rx8 etc are all really really fun cars and theyre far better made than the stuff from europe peter at or around 35k and not japanese heres how theyd stack up in my book 1 audi a4 18t\\n2 bmw 325i\\n3 mercedes c230 kompressor\\n4 saab 93 its a carerra chaser for 27k not even close yeah 136 in the quarter mag times with nearly the handling  not even close eh its been mentioned many times the value of the z in context of the pricier carerra the carerra is not super car guy your wish to liken the nissan experience as the crappy old clunker maker your sentra was from is not pertinant in z world subjectivity is fine but dont diss the z for being anything less than it is a stellar performer bested by few and yes a evo is fast but its still a mitsu sedan box econo crapper i dont know about you but when i shell out 30k i dont even want to hear the word problems  people who dont expect problems dont buy bmw or mercedes again ill take my rattle and my window streak and my awesome performing ride i dont need the 1 percentile best jd power car that bores mei need a car that makes me get out of bed in the middle in the night from calling me to drive it unless you buy honda or lexus or buick you accept some inferiority to the perfect trouble free ownership experience youll learn that when you spend 80k on a 750 bmw or a xj that you get even more trouble for your extra money the g motor will last 250k and the reliability is expected to be stellar hapring on this is futile nothing from germany would ever come so close on my list of cars that would be pretty easy and cheap to maintian over a 10 year period 3 series would be a disaster for that long you expect alot but your expectations are misaligned with what youll be getting if you climb the social car ladderunless you want to be a lexus driver all your life since when did infiniti become not so reliable anyway when i say problems i should say annoyances which were few but expected in a first eyar car  mine is an 03and flawless i might add with 20k front midships rule the world guys ineveitably this will be realized lol yeah 136 in the quarter mag times with nearly the handling it does not have the handling however in the hands of an average driver the z is easier in the hands of a skilled driver the porsche will pass the z like a milktruck street racing is not the forum to find out if any one car is faster or not bmw reliability is not an oxymoron bmw is tops in a number of different ownership surveys i will admit in defects100 lexus rules but that doesnt mean bmw is unreliable nor does it mean every lexus just goes nor do i find friends who have acuras hondas infinitis or nissans have cars that are more reliable than mine yes i know in my world recommendations and anectdotal evidence are important street racing is not the forum to find out if any one car is faster or not i thought we were mag racingalso yes a porsche in the hands of the skilled driver is a dream and driving bliss cant get much betteralso a skilled 6speed z driver may outdrive an ok carerra driver i would expect an 80k machine to own a z  but that will only happen with a great driver and an extra 50k these cars are not that comparable but yet on the track they become often comapredgo figure you may not like it but its the baddest 27k car out there imo you can get a loaded mazda 6 for more than that my pick for luxury japanese sport sedans is the infiniti g35 second on my list is the acura tsx i liked the tsx almost as much as the a4 some would argue that probably the tl deserves the sport better than the tsx but i have not driven the new tl so i cannot comment the z is not an entry level luxo anything you are comparing two different cars that is why talking about wrx is not far fetched yes for the price it cant be beat except by an wrx which i do believe has at least 2 more seats but that is where it ends looks like nissan is right at the industry average and infiniti is 3 again who and why were we talking smack about infiniti being a problem car this out today from jd power brand problems100

that hell take anecdotal evidence namely that his own car is relatively problem free while he knows a lot of japanese cars with problems over such surveysdata save your breath in this case typing or copypasting bmw is tops in a number of different ownership surveys i will admit in defects100 lexus rules but that doesnt mean bmw is unreliable nor does it mean every lexus just goes nor do i find friends who have acuras hondas infinitis or nissans have cars that are more reliable than mine yes i know in my world recommendations and anectdotal evidence are important \\nrefuse to admit reality reliability frequency and repair costs on german cars  daunting ive owned two german cars in the past 3 years the vw was a nightmare the bmw needs to go in again as my sunroof is rattling something terrible already had the parking brake replaced the car is only 13 months old at this rate thats a new problem every 6 months not a good sign for bmw refuse to admit reality what reality are you talking about the reality that japanese products are less reliable than the surveys say and german products are more weve been down here before you can quote chapter and verse nuff said edit  according to a post on the luxury marquees board the latest jd powers survey is out toyotalexusgmporschebmw  made the top 5 what does is really mean between number 1 and number 5 one more trip to the dealer every two years even if its one more trip thats totally unacceptable when broken down by brand bmw drops to the middle because bmw is a small manufacturer their stock rises the moment you combine the brands of manufacturers as a brand bmw is middle of the road as we all know being average is a failing grade even if its one more trip thats totally unacceptable i disagree it is what it is you could get a lexus and hope you are in the category of car owner that lexus would like you to be in or you could get a dog either way there are never any guarantees playing the odds in reliability is no different than gambling at vegas the reality that japanese products are less reliable than the surveys say and german products are more this really makes no sense to me we all know that you like your bimmer but come on playing the odds in reliability is no different than gambling at vegas incorrect analogy the odds with each carmaker is different you have better odds with japanese lux makes than german lux makes as a brand bmw is middle of the road sometimes you have to consider individual models within the brand the e39 530 is arguably the best sedan that has ever been made cr called it the best sedan they have ever tested ill take it a step further e39 m5 is the king not too middle of the road here it handles affords amazing manners as a lux cruiser and has a steven segal reserve of butt kick for when the bad guys get out of line awesome vehicle bmw as a brand is middle of the road by model i havent seen the stats by make we all have in the family of bmws the last gen 5 may be a smooth operating piece of machinery strange how kd didnt respond to this part because bmw is a small manufacturer their stock rises the moment you combine the brands of manufacturers as a brand bmw is middle of the road as we all know being average is a failing grade bmw bashing has become one of my favorite topics lately due to their fashion gambit accordingly i think their sales will continue on a downhill slalom but i think middle of the road as a brand is a little over the top curious which brand or brands do you consider above the middle pardon me if you said it and i missed it it happens toggling between work and the chatter infiniti acura and lexus all score far higher for reliability as brands than bmw bmw scored 264 problems per 100 cars the industry average is 269 you cant be much more middle of the road lexus hit in there at 164 or 69 too lazy to scroll up now thats well made for those that like anecdotal evidence 2 bmws in my familythey were always at the dealer for electrical gremlins 3 lexus cars in the family the only time they saw a dealer was for scheduled oil changes bottom line my anectdotal evidence supports the jd power study lexus cars are built like swiss watches bmw does not hold a candle to lexus reliability my budget 35k priority 1 safety 2 reliability 3 performance yeah i only have one life and i don146t want to spend too much of my life at the service department at dealer146s the 95 has great reliability scores and stellar safety performance may or may not satisfy based on your judgement of cource bmw would fit in that category as well my bmw has been a problemfree tank so obviously all of them must be personally i dont like japanese cars either i think a lot of bmw owners dont break in their engines properly bc they cant hold back on revving their new cars improperly broken in cars will have a lot more mechnanical problems than properly broken in cars as far as safety  your objective statments and cultish faithfulness to marketing aside unless you can point to engineering or proven technolgy in the supposed superior car from sweden or germany then i dont think the emotion of your willingness to pay a premium for a slower less agile car dont really matter the same can be said for everything youve said about nissan but unlike nissan the brands i spoke of volvo mb are the ones that nissan got the knowledge from to make the car you drive safe today theyve proven their technology since they came up with it and nissan has since adopted all of it that is the biggest proof in the world whatever is no response to the 350z having subpar interior worse than many gm cars in terms of material quality the 350z will get its lugnuts handed to it by a 911 because buy it doesnt address my comment about the interior people by certain gm cars too with playskool interiors doesnt justify anything this premium you keep talking about isnt even present on the cars i mentioned and european cars that cost a grip do so for other reasons some good and some bad that premium isnt all wrapped in safety engineering like youre trying to imply it is m not sure what people mean when they say they dont like japanese cars most car companies today are multinational in terms of their engineering design and production for example americans design bmws and bmw has both a major design studio and a huge production plant in usa take the lotus elise sold in the usa is it british or japanese or both it uses a toyota engine and transmission does it matter no because it is a fun and exciting car you should be trying to get the best car that meets your needs and fits your budget regardless of the marque to do otherwise is irrational i think their sales will continue on a downhill slalomre bmw sales as many problems as they have thier sales are increasing i believe people will pay a premium and accept a few problems for a premnium ride vw is one that wouldnt have survived may be gone this time if not for perceived value merc im glad your favorite car companies had thier safety engineers on the payroll  it makes every car safer even mine 0 it uses a toyota engine and transmission does it matter no because it is a fun and exciting car it does to me im interested in the elise because it has that toyota engine matched withe super light body if it had a ford engine the beauty of the lotus is thier willingness to focus on the framecontent and suspension and let the most reliable engine maker out there give you instant credibility and reliablity where normally there is maintnenance and service nightmares who can work on an esprit toyota engines are maintenance free arent they what a coombo to bad im so tall or id be into that elise where are the may sales sheets for bmw somebody please prove me wrong they did not come out of the gate well with the new models except x5 which really cant compare to anything within bmw they are discounting unprecedented for them i think come septemberoctober we are going to see real concern from bmw regarding sales the only thing thats keeping them slightly in the black is platform diversity that part of their plan worked and 545 is living proof that muscle sells dont know about these new highrevving engines they seem to have on the board this should mean no lowend torque most people want the latter and have no clue how to drive highrevving buzz bombs regarding elise i salute anyone who gets one and stays with it talk about spartan anyone who gets turned on by elise is from the sports car elite chris no doubt tall guys got shortchanged with sports cars im 6 feet and feel thats the limit for comfort maybe 6 1 no matter run downcourt and take it to the hole  not sure what people mean when they say they dont like japanese cars well one issue is they are typically uncomfortable for me they seem to be designed either for smallerframed people than i i was looking at an acura rsx and the salesman was lauging at me trying to get comfortable in the car i do however think that there is more similarity than difference between cars from the same engineering culture and you can make very general statements about control heaviness safetyeuropen vs reliabilityjapanese etc the fact is a 35k car is a 35k car and engineers are about as good all over the world cars at the same price point are all about equally contented albeit often in very different areas and we ought to choose based on our wants in these areas instead we often succumb to magazine articles and marketing campaigns but its weird to me how attached people get to a marquis shouting the strong areas and denying the compromises dave are there people who actually look at safety first and then the carcontentpricemaker those are rare breeds and if they are really concerned about having the best latest most proven safety record car they will be changing brands every year or so heres my opinion on these 1 2004 acura tl  i own it it was my choice for value style reliability performance\\n2 g35  my second choice cheaper bmw with same performance but less style\\n3 bmw 3  still is the benchmark but the japanese and even the new caddy is really making it harder for them to stay at the top of my list the new tl and g35 are just too good for the money\\n4 mb cclass  needs a redesign\\n5 cadicallac cts  nice first effort and they are really coming along the ctsv is awesome\\n6 lexus is 300 but if it looked more luxurious on the inside it would have been higher when we bought a saab as my wifes car safety was the 1 criteria when i bought my bimmer safety was relegated to 23 after performance comfort at this point i wouldnt get a car unless i thought it had really excellent overall safety ive had too many near misses dave im still compelled by the fact that accordscamrys and overall mid sized sedans that are agile do the best overall for  of fatalities over miles driven this stat is indicitive of the drivers role in accident avoidance possibly the agility better than an suv but no g or 3 and certainly the improvements in feauteres that are now standard for safety and frame construction is the safest car out there a honda accord  maybe  prob not for a semi collision is is the safest in terms of safely driven miles which is what we all really wantyes while multiple correlations exist the driver is in my opinion more important than the vehicle at least with similar type cars im still compelled by the fact that accordscamrys and overall mid sized sedans that are agile do the best overall for  of fatalities over miles driven i seem to remember readingseeing volume adjusted the europeans did better but i guess the old expression figures lie and liars figure apply here when i got my car the first thought in my mind was safety followed by finesse i know a lot of people who buy a car for safety and then buy a house on the san andreas fault doesnt make any sense to me i dont buy my car by first looking at the nhsta or iis websites i take it for granted all entry level luxo cars are safe within a statistical difference or two life is too short and i also dont have a problem going to san fransisco is the safest car out there a honda accord  maybe  prob not for a semi collision is is the safest in terms of safely driven miles which is what we all really wantyes camcord drivers tend to drive like the near dead is it a shock fatalities would be higher in sport sedans when those drivers will tend to pilot with a little more energy on average the drivers of sport sedans probably arent that much more aggressive given the obscene number of poseurs who own bmws but still the cars must attract more aggressive drivers than camcords with 80 of 3 series being auto i guessed most drivers are prob not that enthusiastic in the entry lux class i think 85 of gs are auto as for suvs a cute yute whats a yutemy cousin vinny is imo safer than an escalade with 80 of 3 series being auto i guessed most drivers are prob not that enthusiastic in the entry lux class thats ironic considering you drive an auto and consider yourself an enthusiast most of the people i know who drive bimmers are enthusiast but dont want to row the gears in traffic jams  similiar to you similiar to me i agree kd i have both stick and auto cars i like both for very different reasons a lot of these stick guys are just arrogant so are some of the bmw sportpackage zealots its like im cool i own a car for all of the right reasons theres such a thing as a luxury car a sports car and everything in between you can be an enthusiast on any level and if you are not an enthusiast and just someone who appreciates a car for any reason who cares here we go again stick and sp round 67 bring it on lets see if there are any new and convincing arguments  httpwwwkptechnologiesnetchrischris_racehtm while i am the exception to my own stereotype i am an enthusiast with a 5at i believe the tranny choice is a great indicator of ones enthusiasm but not all the time i would love an manual agian but i wouldnt drive it as much as i do now in this traffic disaster area the vid is me having fun with a 6 speed coupe at atco nj last april not bad for being 20 hp shy of the coupe out of the box with 4 doors and a 5at my run was 142 at 97 and he was 147 at 93 other sedans ran 15 that day and zs ran 143 except for some lightly modded guys that ran 136 the fi guys rock with 12s nice vid chris did you launch the car in manumatic mode or in full auto just curious i don146t think enough people appreciate the bmw steptronic it146s a good compromise sans clutch not talking about racing also to bmws credit the smg has both the stickpaddle shift option unlike many cars that don146t offer the stick in manual mode i can146t stand the paddle shifters to me they seem like a major pain on the hairpins\\x85 like throwing darts at a moving board anyone here have experience with paddle shifters and turning would like to hear comments paddle shifter are ok but im a hand on the tranny guy even in auto ruined a 5 speed after 100k by holding hand on shifter all the time in 5 the gs is better without the paddle imo from driving a very close friends the gs sucks after driving a g tho so im biased overall i stuck her in mm 4 and did no shifting manually this is the fastest way to get there according to many many track types with whom i consulted heavily before running as this was my first try or my only track day ever ps i got a 089 rt and a 219 60 the key is lanuching at 1700 with a little brake torqing and a good burnout before to warm up the turanaza pukers thats ironic considering you drive an auto and consider yourself an enthusiast most of the people i know who drive bimmers are enthusiast but dont want to row the gears in traffic jams  similiar to you similiar to me not an enthusiast imho sorry but the automatic is a dog especially that steptronic video game driving you buy a step bmw what youre saying is youre not willing to make a compromise to really enjoy the cars dynamics whats the compromise you shift in traffic its no big deal the smug types who drive sedans with sport setups are funny they think they are driving real sports cars\\x85 as cute as when our kids take the training wheels off their bikes and think they have conquered the world to me the sedan format is the ultimate compromise when it comes to sport driving never mind the tranny i guess we can argue forever about who is and who isnt an enthusiast i am enthusiastic about winning if i racethe tranny is just a mechanical interference getting in bewtween us and the accelration and g forces when blueguy drives a 911 with a 6 speed then he can talk enthusiasm if i only drove it once a week it would be a 2 seater and would be a 6 speed and it sure wouldnt be a bmw everybody has a different defenition to some you are only an enthusiast if you drive stick to some enthusiasts are those that drive cars with two doors imo the fact that we are here arguing about cars while we could be doing much more productive things makes us all car enthusiasts you dont need a 911 to be an enthusiast it has to do with how much you can affordi love fast carsi have a mustang gt right now because thats all i could afford out of college but i needed a big engine i certainly didnt buy an automatic i deal with bad traffic in the silicon valley but a stick was the only way to go ive had so much fun in that car doing things that many of my friends have no interest inbecause they dont care about acceleration like i do its a drug to me im looking at this thread because id like to get a 330i with zhp its not a 911 but the bmw has excellent handling and the power is nothing to sneeze at although im worried it wont have enough torque since the feel of accelerating is more imporant to me than actually getting my from point a to b the fastestbut ill test drive soon and find out for sure i love fast cars but its simply not practical for me to have a 2 seat sports carand im not rich enough yet to have a weekend viper in addition to my lux sedan if an auto makes you happy than thats great but you cant say blueguy is wrong about a stick being a lot more fun and worth the extra pain in traffic for many people agreedwe are all enthusiastic about our completely practical daily driversexcept the coupes can be less practical i supposeoh and blue only drives weekends but is clearly still enthused i really am not suggesting that he is not an enthuisiast simply that i am i cant get into a 911 without getting killed just yet either so i feel for ya after 11 years of sticks in several cars i needed some more practicality in my old age with a gf that loves to drive my car fast but not a stick also the manual g is not comfortable for my 65 frame as the seating position is different for me when using left leg whatever floats the boat but a sedan driver with his compromise is not going to throw a stone at my glass house compromise with out a lob back at him the g auto is about the only one i would ever own maybe a vette also when 8 speed smgs are the norm the 6 speed will lose it luster and then what will you stick guys do to keep up i hear ya i definitely agree that you can be an enthusiast without a stick the point is you enjoy driving and you love your car im also considering the g35i dont like the styling as much but i love the engine my fiance cant drive stick eitheri plan on teaching her i considered going to autoher car is obviously auto and its nice to drive it and take a break sometimes but after thinking about it i think id really miss being able to downshift and take off just personal preference i wont own an automatic i love driving too much maybe a vette also when 8 speed smgs are the norm the 6 speed will lose it luster and then what will you stick guys do to keep up \\nif i can avoid an smg i will do everything in my power to do so yuck no third pedal  no fun oh and blue only drives weekends but is clearly still enthused i only drive the bmw on weekends but i drive a stick daily all the cars ive ever owned have been manual there is only one reason that will ever change the lazy people win out and automatic and smg are the only options in 510 years and i drive 8090 miles a day in rush hour with a muscle disorder that limits my mobility and makes my limbs sore so dont give me the tired leg garbage a little pain is worth the reward i spend 3 hours of my day in bumper to bumper traffic i wont drive stick in that mess i value my leg gimme automagicsorry blue i avoid pain whenever possible those that equate pain with fun are called masochists count me out if you need to feel that control in a madza 4 cylinder while in traffic jams then you are way more enthusiastic than i am actually a 4 cylinder is easy to drive and i wouldnt own it without a stick to be honest as a 4 clinder mated to an auto is awful for driving around town in you guys hear my tires chirp in 3rd i drive my a4 18t cvt around town and it has plenty of power for meand thats a 4 banger our millenia is a v6 and my a4 kicks its butt actually the bmw is far better in traffic put it in second and you can take the car down to 23 mph without touching the clutch and take it all the way to 60 from there as long as you dont come to a total stop its not bad at all in a bimmer speedy your car is also a turbo and not a low powered mazda to which my comments were directed the mileenia is no powerful 6 but good enough for a family hauler in auto version right cvt is way better than an auto and much better for a 4 cylinder i would guess my father in law to be maybe just got the a4 with the 30 is that cvt too cvt is way better than an auto and much better for a 4 cylinder i would guess my father in law to be maybe just got the a4 with the 30 is that cvt too if your father in law to be got the a4 30 frontrack he got cvt if he got the a4 30 quattro then he gets tiptronic which is not as good btwnissan makes a cvt equipped g35 called skyline 350gt8 unfortunately it is only available in japan the closest thing we get here that combines the vq35 and cvt is the nissan murano having driven the murano i can say that cvt would probably work wonders in the lighter more nimble g35 another thing why is it that nissan can design a cvt that can easily handle more than 240 horses and awd while audi with their great germanic engineering wisdom cant produce a cvt that handles awd or more than 220hp ive actually read articles about how cvt cant handle the torquey engines americans favor i scratch my head and wonder if people ever do research as the murano i drove was torquey nissans awd system and thier cvt seem light years ahead of the germans in terms of 04 cars anyway the cvt things seems compelling but i need a few more years of wathcing it before i jump in call it the infinite smg without sequencing i dont think your 18t cvt stand any chance against the millenia s maybe the base car but not the s 4door im not cool\\nsport pkg im cool\\nsteptronic im not cool\\nm68 wheels im cool\\nwifes car im not cool sshheewwww im happy chris cvt is sooo smooth no abrupt jerks as your tranny goes from one gear to the nextactually no shifting sensation at all just the pure rush of seemless accelaration it takes a little to get used to it but once you are you think of other automatics as unrefined blue the nissan cvt called xtroid can handle massive amounts of torque nissan has been using cvt in mosters as the cedric and gloria in japan for years for once audi is way behind on this one billy true the millenia s is quite a barn stormer the standard l which is the one i have is such a dog that ive been lapped by old ladies on walkers actually the bmw is far better in traffic put it in second and you can take the car down to 23 mph without touching the clutch and take it all the way to 60 from there as long as you dont come to a total stop its not bad at all in a bimmer otoh a total stop makes a manual bmw with its long pedal travel no fun at all in rush hour traffic unfortunately total stops are frequent and necessary in order to stay close to the car in front of you 25mph slow drift would be asking for being cut off and i drive 8090 miles a day in rush hour with a muscle disorder that limits my mobility and makes my limbs sore so dont give me the tired leg garbage a little pain is worth the reward no wonder youre so crabby on these forums sometimes unfortunately total stops are frequent and necessary in order to stay close to the car in front of you 25mph slow drift would be asking for being cut off ahh yes thats why i wont drive a shiftany shift any make any manufacturer in traffic did it for 12 years and now car with a manual is for 1200am sunday to 500am sunday when there is no one on the road and i can have fun thats the only reason i dont have one all else is good but for the 13 mph drip 50 miles in dc traffic on memorial day friday as the entire city evacuates into northern vayou think blueguy is crabbyi need speed therapy after that need speed therapy after that sorry chris my therapy sessions are booked solid through next year its ok once you get past richmond on 85 things get much better quickly there is no less travelled ihighway i know of  especially on a bright weekend morning on the way back home just need the v1 to catch the k band total stops are frequent and necessary in order to stay close to the car in front of you 25mph slow drift would be asking for being cut off let them cut me offnot as if i care i still drift no wonder youre so crabby on these forums sometimes no no no im naturally irascible i come from a long line of pugnacious people  im mostly german any thoughts on the altima please specifically 05 altima 35 se with manual trans 250 hp249 torque 25 grand how is the shifter original reviews cited unfavorable shifter on the 02 or 03 altima also torque steer from what ive read it pulls 060 in under 6 seconds so we already know it is very fast havent driven it but i can tell you that i dont think the shifter should be the dealbreaker unless its extreme imo you get used to most insufficiencies in shifters aside from that i think the altima styling is clean tight balanced altima g35 coupe and 350z are the best designs to come out of nissan imo furthermore i think they are some of the best styles around period this car has a real good torquetoweight ratio nice choice if fwd with that power is not an issue it would rule it out in my book but its obvious that it doesnt bother everyone with the altima you may be getting more than you bargained for in terms of time at the shop know several people who had them and they just couldnt wait to get rid of them the 060 numbers dont mean anything if you cant control the car the previous models drove like a boat you can expect torque steer and without any traction control aids and torque steer you can accelerate yourself into a tree like my friend did on a slippery road nice looking car newer models have an updated interior but that engine has major torque steer and nissan trannies are bad  this comes from a long time nissan fan best car i ever owned was a 91 nissan stanza that was a solid nicely built carfar better than my 01 jetta 03 bmw or 03 protege with the altima you may be getting more than you bargained for in terms of time at the shop know several people who had them and they just couldnt wait to get rid of them and as we all know your chances of taking a car to the shop depends on how many people kdshapiro knows whove had a problem with that car in any case this is probably the wrong thread to talk about altimas but that engine has major torque steer engines dont torque steer fwd cars do and nissan trannies are bad nissan autos are among the best in the business better than honda anydaynot as good as toyota honda has the best manuals nissan is not known for the manualsyet ive heard their closeratio six speed in the 350z is a very good tranny in any case this is probably the wrong thread to talk about altimas so why are you talking about them engines dont torque steer fwd cars do i know exactly where the torque steer comes from and actually it is somewhat related to the engine the tendency of fwd to exhibit torque can be tamed somewhat what unequal its not even worth it nissan autos are among the best in the business i totally disagree nissan makes junk trannies that are clunky slow and poorly engineered not as bad as bmw and ford trannies but still bad the manuals on the g35 altima and max were just as bad as the one on my old stanza rubbery vague truckline buckets of bolts better than honda anydaynot as good as toyota honda has the best manuals nissan is not known for the manualsyet ive heard their closeratio six speed in the 350z is a very good tranny wait a second at one moment youre saying theyre better than honda then contradicting that by mentioning hondas trannies are the best what the blazes when i mention trannies im only talking about the kind of tranny that matters  manual automatic rather be dead when was i talking about altimas i was refuting your logic which has been recounted many times in this thread that your anecdotal evidence can somehow apply as a generalization about a particular car why altima because what i really want is g35 6 speed which is an awesome car but dont really want the payments and the 32grand price tag altima is fast sporty and comfortable but i understand it is not quite in this league the reason i put it here is because no one in the altima thread has any info also i am considering 6 speed maxima se it is about 1500 more than altima considering the markup and 1000 rebate i can get a 6 spd max with sunroof plus it has all safety and abs standard which altima doesnt for about 25 grand right now at the local dealer how is that shifter and torque steer thanks all for your thoughts actually maxse 6 sp w roof is about 245 negotiated price and alt 5 spd w roof is about 228 grand other alternatives are mazda 6 hatch love it except not enough power and maybe the new subie legacy 25 turbo also have not driven accord coupe 6 speed but its probably in a similar ballpark corvette the german car makers starting to make critical mistakes jul 4 2004 210am check out the paragraph the only difference between my small sample observations or anectdotal evidence as you say and this poster is the lack of angelic reliability i know exactly where the torque steer comes from and actually it is somewhat related to the engine the tendency of fwd to exhibit torque can be tamed somewhat what unequal the maxima and the g35 have the same engine one car torque steers the other one doesnt the difference is one is fwd the other rwd torque steer also relates to the suspension setup and the layout of the driveshaft wait a second at one moment youre saying theyre better than honda then contradicting that by mentioning hondas trannies are the best please read what i wrote i said honda automatics stink yet their manuals are the best around ive owned 86 celica gt 87 integra 92 maxima se and now both 03 tls and 03 maxima se all of them have autotrannies and i can say that the auto in the nissans have much more quicker and smoother up and downshifts than those in the acuras the interactions between the engine and the transimission are more subtle and instinctive in the nissans but then again i should already be dead for driving autoat least according to you blue  is that i found the autotranny in my 00 tl was not responsive enough for my driving style even though i used seq shifting often i still wasnt getting the kind of control i was used to with my previous 92 accord 4l 5speed automatics on sport sedans nothing like dating halle berry and making her wear a tent and clogs i like driving fast but im neither reckless nor a drag racer i like to start thing gradually and then push it to the limit that i deem reasonable and appropriate for the circumstance while i drive like a granny around town i become a road devil on the highways for long distance travel i spend 90 of the time driving in the two left lanes so for my driving style a manual would be just a another nuisance oh and ill take halle berry anytimeeven if she doesnt wear anything  i think infiniti can really increase sales by selling the g with a 30l engine g30 which already exists in japan for about 2000 less than a g35 in an age of rising gas prices this makes even more sense the 325i outsells the 330i by almost 5 to 1 what would the 3 series sales be without the 25l option apparently the next c will have 25 30 35 engine choices as well thanks merc1 for this info of course selling a g30 could hurt infinitis power image you might argue that its not good to have a g30 while lesser nissan sedans such as the altima and the maxima have larger 35l v6s then have the 30l option in the altima and maxima as well bmw does the same thing they make the 525i even though the 330i exists and the 525i sells wellalmost as well as the 530i increase brand awareness by catering to a wider market of buyers by offering a g30 these buyers may also trade up as they get older face it infiniti has made great progress in the past couple years but it still has nowhere the brand recognition of bmw mb or lexus of course they should also go more upscale by concentrating on the m sedan and coupe as well as the next q all the press and buzz and comparisons that bmw makes is with the 330i yet the reality is that the 325i is their bread and butter the g35g30 relationship could be the same a 230hp g30 w premium package at an msrp of 32k 29k street price should get a lot of people in the door blueguy i thnk anyone with a g35 tranny will argue that it is one of the best in the biz the lost power for six speed to 5at is minimal as any car ive ever seen stats on take a look at the 3 series drop in times when going auto and then look at 5at the vaugeness is handled by enthusiastic owners and thier easy remedies smooth shifting defined in a tranny built for a much higher power q45 v8 jrock65 you should look at the epa fuel mileage estimates for the 325i and 330i you might be surprised the 325i really doesnt get you anything in mileage some due to gearing some due to small engine for the weight i do wish toyotalexus had marketed a barebones is200 with 6speed manual in usa toyota sells it in japan and europe blueguy i thnk anyone with a g35 tranny will argue that it is one of the best in the biz thats the problem with anyone arguing its all personal opinion the bmw steptronic has been lauded for being one of the best in class it gets you more in mileage round town not on the highway cruising at 65 foot lightly on the accelerator i live in an area with total different traffic than you lot of heavy stop and for miles and miles a 325 has better mileage in this type of traffic than a 330 having owned a nissan equipped with the vq30 and driven many vq35s my vote actually goes to the smaller engine the vq30 is a lot smoother especially in the higher rpm ranges in terms of bringing a smaller engine size wouldnt bother with a g30 too close to the g35 but a g25 skyline 250gt would actually be an great entry level infiniti kd the steptronic is great at everything but keeping you from owning a dog when you wanted a cat the auto makes an otherwise very strong motor seem less enthusiastic and frankly slow the manual is a very nice compliment to the straight six the auto saps power somehow so while nice and smooth its less than desirable to many who dont want to sacrifice performance because they live in the northeast kdshapiro im talking about both city and highway epa estimates the 325i is not fuel efficient of course both a 330i and a 325i will get 0 mpg when stuck in heavy traffic and waiting at stoplights that is the downside to heavy urban traffic and roadway congestion 325i uses a numerically higher final drive than the 330i that impacts rpms in all gears lowering fuel economy bmw can market the 525 to people who want a bigger sedan with no concern for speed remember many nonenthusiast will look at bmw for nothing more than status if the 525 was reduced in size and the 330 was increased than you would be looking at different sales figures for the 525 blueguy i thnk anyone with a g35 tranny will argue that it is one of the best in the biz the lost power for six speed to 5at is minimal as any car ive ever seen stats on take a look at the 3 series drop in times when going auto and then look at 5at the vaugeness is handled by enthusiastic owners and thier easy remedies smooth shifting defined in a tranny built for a much

propensity for eating brakes or the truckish trannies they come with thats sell quite well they should mod that nissan 25 a bit maybe a low pressure turbo to give it over 200 hp and 200 ftlbs of torque price the g at 25k or so without all the fixings top out at around 32k with moon navi etc itd sell like hotcakes itd be what the g20 never was to infiniti  an entry level car thatll attract droves i have been looking at the g35 awd sedan and was wondering what kind of gas mileage you can expect\\nfrom the car a newspaper reporter is looking for someone who bought a luxury car with lots of highend gadgets and ended up either not programming most of it or having lots of problems getting it to work please respond to jfallonedmundscom by thursday july 8 2004 by 5 pm eastern and be sure to include your daytime phone number and a few words about your vehicle and gadgets thanks\\njeannine fallon\\npr director\\nedmundscom they build hearty durable long lasting cars with solid fit and finish same cant be said of bmw if you insert the words kind of after the word they ill agree with that statement the reason the 325i sells so well compared to the 330i is because the difference in performance is less dramatic than one might expect and the 325i is almost 5000 cheaper that and the fact that many 325i buyers dont care about speed or performance just the spinning propeller on the hood i think its mainly the price performancewise i think there is a huge difference the 325i might actually be more nimble than the 330i but the power difference feels significant especially with the auto transmission in a straight line the 325i feels like a 4cylinder accord the 330i can almost keep up with the g35s and tls out there but apparently most 3 series buyers would rather be in a relatively sluggish 35k vehicle keep the 5k and have the propeller on the hood the engine performance difference between the 30 and 25 is pretty extreme imho i flat out would not purchase a 325ithere wasnt a noticeable jump in power from my 18t an extra 10k for rwd no thanks id rather have the cheaper but just as quick feeling tsx over the 325i  more entertaining engine better tranny more features and bulletproof for 30k the 325 should have more going for it than handling for 30k the 325 should have more going for it than handling it does    propeller on the hood ah but the propeller on the hood signifies a common theme in bmws lineup of vehicles quality performance oriented drivers automobiles its irrelevant whether you want to acknowledge that or not people understand this about bmws i laugh everytime some says the propellor on the hood because it ignores the obvious that people want what they want and it seems those comments are all about jealousy its not my place to comment because someone buys an 3000 armani suit for the name or a propeller on the hood for the emblem obviously the name armani and the propeller on the hood means something to the buyer im sorry but 325 is not performance oriented vehicle just bacouse bmw makes m5 and m3 it does not mean that 325 and 525both account for more than 50 of sedan sales are performance oriented acura makes nsx which is arguably better performance car than m5 and its 15 years old but it does not make tl or tsx more performance oriented nothing really to be jealous about a 35000 3 series bimmer please i do agree with you that there is nothing wrong with buying a car just for its name people buy things for different reasons that still doesnt change the observations of many on this board that many 3 series buyers principal reason for getting one is for the badge again there is nothing wrong with this almost by default the regular posters who own a 3 is not in the above category anyways it seems that the next generation 330i will have 258hp221 torque 30l not sure what the 325i will have but itll probably have at least 210hp that should make its performance a bit more lively its irrelevant whether you want to acknowledge that or not people understand this about bmws i dont think all the housewives driving 325s in northern nj understand this about bmws i do think they understand the meaning of the propeller on the hood take a look of the acura tl aspec concept 300hp and new exterior style\\nlove it httpwwwautoweeknlnewsdispphpcachenoid2101 httpwwwvtecnetnewsnewsitemnews_item_id187028 heres another example of wasting 6 grand i own a g35x and the gas mileage is one of my biggest disappointments with the car i have a long commute with 80 highway driving  75  80 mph and i have been averaging 20 mpg i have over 8000 miles on the car and i followed the breakin procedure recommended by infiniti there are boards dedicated to infiniti and infiniti g35 where other owners have posted their experiences with respect to gas mileageperhaps those would help you can email me if you want the sites but matched with nissans gearing man does it gobble gas add in the weight of the awd system and its not a shock mileage is so bad the non awd gets about 22 until broken in then about 2325 on hiway not much better and the awd system is very effivcient and maybe another 180 pounds looking at the weights online 6 mos ago anyway like i have said  get the crawford z plenum and up that by 34 mpg  i get about 28 on the hiway also you arent bnroken in until about 15k people are finding improvements are coming in big surprising doses well after a year of ownership several friends who have g35s get low twenties and this seem consistent with online reports expect awd to cost about 2mpg or so a plenium getting 34mpg improvement is pure snake oil no one with a lick os sense is going to buy that a car cruising on the highway has the throttle at high restriction anyways so less restriction in the intake obviously isnt going to help im not sure how much the stick shift is going to help mpg but if youre interested in a sports sedan this is obviously what youre going to choose otherwise save your money and buy a buick well enjoy the taste of snakeoil since all your friend get low 20s and i get 440 miles on 1 tank not going below e do you even know what a plenum does einstien sorry every person i know with a g35 nets 22 mpg or lower i mention getting 30 on the freeway and a friend with a g his eyes light up hes delighted if he can eek out 24 mpg on a freeway trip to vegas yes i do wideflow plenums sometimes do increase highend power especially when turbos or superchargers are involved but when throttle is mostly closed  as when a 35l engine is noodling along on the highway  and vacuum is high increasing airflow to the engine obviously isnt going to drive mpg way up to quote the ednumds test were also unsure as to the fuel economy outlook with the allwheeldrive system as our test vehicle averaged only 154 miles per gallon while in our care and i get 440 miles on 1 tank not going below e the g35 has a 20 gallon tank 4402022mpg so that means you get maybe 23mpg youre still doing better than other people i know my 7 year old bmw with a 17 gallon tank has gotten over 550 miles on a tank dave httpwwwkptechnologiesnetchrischris_racehtm proof is right here in terms of power increases anyway try again with real math since i wont brave using the 5 gallon reserve i fill up at e on the nose lets be conservative and say that there are 4 of 20 gallons left so 44016275 pretty good and obviously there is better math with a fillup for actual gallons the stock plenum is choking the front bank of cylinders for air a less restrictive plenum doesnt allow for more air it allows the same air to work more efficently by more equally sharing the airflow and distribution of that airflow lots of people doubt this snakeoil plenum adds any power either and thats why enthusiasts race and test and race and test and the rest of the daisy drivers wonder and live with things the way they are i didnt get from 15 to 142 in the quarter mile with twin turbos  a pulley and a plenum is all it takes 750 total ps can your 7 year old bmw keep up with a golf nope those guys have magnets that polarize their fuel and double their horsepowermade by the same guys selling you your plenum and pulley dave i noticed its the beemer guys who doubt this the most just like the coupe guy did until i schooled him on the ways of crawford z engineering  noe he sports one too enjoy your 318i 0 putting new design plenum on g35390 consulting with several memebers of dedicated website for 12 months and running dynos to verify results while consulting with engineer200 airmchair racing and armchair engineering that conclude diddly priceless like i said anyone who understands how engines work is not going to be fooled by thiseven the crawford z web site says that the plenum only makes a difference adding horsepower at high rpms since you already inadvertantly admitted getting 22mpg in your buickautotranny g35 i dont know why youre getting so excited about this my maxima did terrible gas mileage 18 mpg but then again i didnt get the car for its fuel economy i wouldnt expect the g35 to be fuel efficient i would just enjoy the performance at each fill up my a4 gives me the best of both worlds though i get fast reflexes and 26 mpg couldnt be happier i inadvertantly admitted this exactly the non awd gets about 22 until broken in then about 2325 on hiway not much better and the awd system is very effivcient and maybe another 180 pounds looking at the weights online 6 mos ago anyway  your reading comprehension must be better than you allude with your argument 2325 is not bad and the math works out if you get out your calculator and concentrate anyone who understands how engines work would recognize the value of having all 6 cylinders get equal airflow you may not believe it but most used car buyers wishing they could even keep up with the last generation camary are not worth convincing horsepower added at higher rpms is a sypmtom of the greater efficency if you believe the plenum helps hp then what is your explanation for why hotshot whatever your answer it can be applied to the fuel efficiency argument so you must believe two contradicting thingsnot worth the time anymore but fun during a meeting that is overcome back if you get a real car and want to learn something thats just not how it works in situations where the throttle is wide open airflow is an issue at low rpms on highway drives there is a high level of vacuum in the plenum already and airflow is slownothing is going to get starved even the developers of the plenum say this i know you unfortunately cant cope with a manual transmission but there is a thing on the dash called a tachometer that will help you see highways rpms by the way if by getting our calculator out and concentrating you conclude that 44020  2325 then i see why were having problems communicating dave im averaging 18mpg in the city aggressive driving of course and on the highway this past holiday weekend i averaged 26mpg i was blown away keep in mind that my 03 g35 coupe is used and has about 25k miles so this could support the argument that the gas mileage gets better with age but 26mpg is definitely surprising for a car like this just my 02 for what its worth i suggested that you get the calulcator i work with numbers all day just suggest you follow along since you misquoted me also while you drive your 5 speed and think everyone else that has an auto can not remember that you are special and people really do like you even if you aspire to own a camry when i need a manual i can always turn to the real speed demon the zx11 ninja if you need schooled on shifing i can teach you but id have to charge and while youre at take some classes on engine design bolt ons are one thingfundametally changing the intake is another you babble about throttle positioningwho careswhat matters is the same air please dont repsond until you get this is more evenly distributed stop choking the front 2 cylinders and you dont need to open the throttle as much whether theres a vacuum or not id be jealous of g owners too  we are having alot of fun save up and you can have 300hp someday too i have 28k on my 03 g 5at sedan overall mileage is 194 not sure what  of total miles are cityhighway but driving 7075 mph on i95 will get me 2425 mpg when the traffic allows driving allaround town in the cold dc winter gets me only 1718 mpg this time of year i get around 20 in about 80 city driving epa is 1826 and considering the 26 figure is attained by never crossing 60 mph on the epa test my numbers seem realistic pgill  epa awd figures are 1724 20 mpg doesnt seem all that bad at 7580 mph theres no way you can expect to get 24 mpg at that speed given the way the epa comes up with their figures cute little insults id better start working lots harder so i can afford a less expensive car dave right beemer buyers insist on paying more look its been fun  reacting to someone whos got no real contextual experince to draw from teaching those who have it based on your so called knowledge you didnt expect a boquet i wouldnt be so adamant about things you know little about in real world context unless you like abuse reality speaks volumes and theorizing is a waste of the modders time you didnt pay g prices for a 328 did you hopefully you just didnt update your profile and you have a 540 then youd be able to hang sorry but when i see people making up facts they have no idea about i like to respond other people have a right to get rela information i expected youd be upset to have your little bubble burst but there ya go even the salemen for the plenum dont make the claims you dotheyd get sued still its flattering youve declared that youre done talking to me three times already and yes i only have dreams of being able to hang someday you should be flattered lol i have a special place in my heart for bmw fans actually its my desire to make sure there is real info on here regarding the g as many many people misinform here no crawford doesnt sell based on milage  it more for hp  he quoted 15hp did he not you pretty much abuse the notion that the thing helps fuel effeciency what is your explanation for 15 hp you know i could care less about mileage  just reporting about my results _ i was surprised too i bought it and am happy primarily from a powerrepsonsiveness standpoint which is evident on the video i think people looking for good info have proof in my video pudding you again are left wanting with unproven theory or a desire to be heard maybe you would theorize i get better milage becasue i floor it all the time maybe the plenum sucks and the 500 or so people on g drivercom really got better gas mileage from the break in you come up with something more concrete than your proclomations of baseless never been there theory and i will listen and learnas i always do when giving my baby the best i can again your argument whether focused on power or fuel economies is pretty much been it doesnt work that way look at the videothats all plenum and it rocks whether you can deal with it or not aww im blushing that you keep responding to me  you pretty much abuse the notion that the thing helps fuel efficiency what is your explanation for 15 hp i already explained that plenum restriction does have an impact for high rpm wideopen throttle operation this is normal and expected there are lots of dyno graphs that illustrate thisoften airflow enhancement hurts power at lower rpms counterintuitive but thats how it works i found some interesting g35 dyno charts with the crawford plenum but unfortunately i cant link to them due to town hall rules according to them even 15hp is optimistic but im not arguing about power just the idea that increasing airflow is going to incrase economy it just doesnt work that way your engine is supposed to be starved when cruising on the highway thats the point of a throttle a lot of people seem to assume that increasing one aspect of efficiency  power  is going to positively impact another aspect  fuel economy  theyre often different issuesbut not always of coursereducing internal friction would improve both but thinking that anything that increases power is going to increase fuel economy is like thinking that anything that helps me run faster is also going to help me bench more not necessarily or even often the case dave uh its probably time for the two of you to agree to disagree and move on neither of you is going to convince the other and there is no reason to let this petty squabble overtake this conversation in any case knock off the personal digs thank you a newspaper reporter is wondering if people are satisfied or dissatisfied with their vehicle navigation systems please send your brief comments and daytime contact info to jfallonedmundscom no later than wednesday july 14 2004\\nthanks\\njeannine fallon\\npr director\\nedmundscom a wonderful thing bliss is involved as i recall anyone who understands thermodynamics gear ratios and aerodynamics wont be especially surprised by whats happening with the 35 litre nissan engine on may 24th i posted the following it may still be relevant well its interesting to see that theres yet another board in which the laws of physics and thermodynamics have been repealed is the premise here that some bolton outfit has figured out something that the nissan engineers either a were too stupid to see or b found but didnt want to use because they didnt want the engine that they use in 90 of their vehicles to have more power andor fuel economy its a conspiracy i tell you isnt big oil involved somehow p t barnum lives i bow down to that post excellent ive had my issues with dhanley before but i think hes right on the plenum chrisboth if youre getting 440 miles on a full tank of gas youre averaging 22 mpg which does not indicate a gas mileage improvement for the plenum which one does better in insulating heat btw does anyone know where to get the vkool in the wa area for my cars windows\\ni know they use vkool for office windows sometimes in us but here in us i havent heard of anyone using it in their cars while a lot of people use it for their cars in asia and europe chrisboth if youre getting 440 miles on a full tank of gas youre averaging 22 mpg which does not indicate a gas mileage improvement for the plenum like most i do not go into the 5 gallon reserve i get filled up on e and typically my fill up is about 1415 gallons  not the 20 in your denominator the plenum theory is certainly unproven but the mileage results are facts for many people i agree with the vacuum thing and all the other talk about highway airflow needs not being great enough miss the point regarding inefficient cylinders starved for air is one thingnever getting what the others have ever is another hi rmp whateverim always in high rmp  maybe thats why my results go against all the proposed theory in any case im running a faster car than a magnum 300c or a 540ithats what i bought it for power and repsonse all the mods i have performed have given me better gas mileage in incremental and distinct blips right along with additional power perhaps dhahnley is right and the break in is responsible for my 47 improvement in fuel economy anything is possible but for those laws of physics seem to be working in my favor coppenhead  watch the video and then take some physics classes at your local communinty college bud 142 seconds wont be attributed to my driving skills or light weight oh right its the break in  chris you can lead a horse to water but you cant make it drink i believe auto manufacturers intentionally sandbag cars so they can easily incrementally improve them i believe auto engineers are people and can make mistakes i believe that some enterprising and ethical after market engineers can boost vehicle performance i believe in ghosts but not aliens but if there were aliens they would be our intellectual superiors they would drive g35 because they kick nonpermissible content removed especially with a crawford plenum yoda would insist that his white g35 be suitably plenumed to hades with the warranty hed say as he laid down 6 inch longer strips of burnt rubber with the massive 10 pony power increase yoda would stop by chewys house and they would cruise down to roswell new mexico for a class reunion getting a hefty 2 mpg increase over stock darth would definitely show up in a black bmw 330 talking lots of smack to luke about coming to the dark side zeh gerrrmans haf wayz of making carrrrzz luke leahs skimpy outfit would interupt the conversation only because she doesnt look so good in it any more and so the social posturing would continue the grog would flow and eventually light sabres would be drawn cut to chase scene involving the big bad bmw getting smoked by crawfordized using the force g35 good guys win bad guys end up being your father and i need to lay off the sauce so early in the morning may the scwartz be with you i still think uncle owen should have sold luke to the sand people and hans sti can cook all of them she may not be pretty but shes got it where it counts i believe auto manufacturers intentionally sandbag cars so they can easily incrementally improve them porsche is great for this stop belittling yourself with the lay off the sauce crack creative writing is a good thing its one of the best aspects of the net and not enough people appreciate this nice job euro inc would bring over their wonderful diesel and turbodiesel engined cars the european press raves about cars like the 330d mb is bringing over the e320d great torque and outstanding fuel economy cant wait till usa gets the low sulphur fuel now if only epa and enviromentalist activists in usa would advocate for diesels like their european counterparts how did this converation degrade from plenums to star wars i reiterate my thought i dont mind doing mods but i would stay away from the kind that would void my powertrain warranty the power of the dark side is luring me to chip my 18t but i will resist i dont really get this why the diesels of course its low on fuel consumption but what else does it have\\ni tried 330d when i went to aachen to visit a relative its a great ride doesnt feel like a diesel but otoh its slow and underpowered people always idealize what they dont know or deny what they cant understand from what ive read its a 7 second to 60 car not lightning but for over 35 mpg with cheap diesel fuel savings over 30 cents a gallon that sounds mighty tasty if someone other than vw made a diesel for ca id own one right now how did this conversation degrade from plenums to star wars you call that degradation here try this one out\\x85 beavis hey butthead what146s a bmw butthead i don146t know beavis but i heard it sucks\\x85 uhuh\\x85 i hate things that suck\\x85 uhuh can146t help but wonder which car brand has the highest percentage of beavis  butthead fans can146t you just see them coming back someday 147mature148 and riding around in a z4  a 19 litre turbodiesel rental four times in europe audi 3 times vw once and was stunned the first time at the lowend torque and general good manners of the engine the thing accelerated wonderfully they were all quiet and got 35  40 mpg all conversions done carefully through austria  switzerland serious mountain passes and germany cruising at 90  110 mph given how well the 19 powered the a4  passat a 3 litre would be that much better id buy one in a heartbeat can146t help but wonder which car brand has the highest percentage of beavis  butthead fans easy one chevy how did this conversation degrade from plenums to star wars like it could have gotten any worse thats like saying we were already at the bottom of the well and kept diggin more diesels would be a good thing in the us they get good hole shot because of the torque dogs up high though which has always made me wonder why the germans like em guess for fuel econ heard jeeb liberty is coming with with a diesel doesnt really help entry level lux sedan though mercedes should definitely get on the stick with diesel in us vw too yes the main reason i havent gotten another vehicle yet despite earlier ovservations that my panhandling venture is not going well is because i am awaiting a more ecofriendly notforcingforeignforeignoildependance sportluxury vehicle i suspect i could average cityhighway mix 35mpg in a 330d which would be awesome and it could burn vegetable oil in the process a friend rented a c320d in europe and he acheived 35mpg averaging 100mph on the autobahn anyone see the pics of the nissan gtr concept pics in road  t damn and supposedly will be matching the new m5 in performance specs or shooting for it as a benchmark anyway 2007 will be a great year to buy a car  and it prob wont be from all the diesels or hybrids out there by then well have the v10 m5 the gtr the m4535 a 60 litre hemi or something in a souped up 300c next year i think the audi rs6 redesign and the 3 series with a turbo or v8 kd then well have to rehash all this again and we better start drillin in alaska  these things are gonna suck fuel like i drink sierra nevada hmm it seems like i should probably make mention of the fact that lots of these recent posts dont have anything to do with the subject of our discussion  like most i do not go into the 5 gallon reserve i get filled up on e and typically my fill up is about 1415 gallons  not the 20 in your denominator are you sure youre holding 5 gallons in reserve because then youre averaging nearly 30 mpg thats pretty unbelievable mileage out of the vq which is a pretty thirsty engine no not sure thats why i used 4 in my denominator these cars have huge reserves i never go to e usually let alone below my biggest fill up ever was 166 gallons it holds 20 alright all you young whippersnappers eat a granola bar and lets stoke it up around here saw a new g35 coupe billboard on the nj turnpike very simple shows it in full profile the headline said simply pure indeed it is some guy in the building where i work has one i always find myself ogling it needless to say the look has grown on me its just so smooth and looks bolted to the road wish the front end looked meaner though kind of looks like a droopyeyed smiley face and the headlamps sort of resemble witches fingernails think i could live with this although i wish these car manufacturers would nail things down from head to toe the coupe is a pretty noisy car though for a stock sportlux 75dba at 70 mph is pretty boy racer by todays standards cars like the is300 3 series and cts are under 70 dba at the same speed not sure about you but last time i heard the vq roar in the coupe it made me want to drive hard and fastwhy else did i pay 35k for a car that sound is awesome you want quiet get an avalon these sounds are meant to be heard theres a reason the is is muffled  its sounds like  the g35 coupe should be noisy because it is a sports a wolf in sheeps clothing call it what you will but the g35 mechanically is a 350z with better styling i agree with both of you engines are sweet music no engine no sport i like the 350z styling with reservations on the rear lights altima also has buttonedup styling and i believe it was the first to show the asymmetrical slanted crease running below the beltline that many have hitchhiked onto and most have botched the rest of the nissaninfiniti lineup needs serious help with styling at least they have three bmw has 12 love the styling of the g35 coupe but didnt like the cramped interior poor visibility lack of a trunk cheap interior materials balky shifter and numb steering i felt like i was sitting in a cheap dark small hole when driving the coupe i like the sedan way more a far better though far less sexy looking car imho now a drop top g35 coupe  that would at least remove the closedin tight dank hole feeling and supposedly infiniti is making the interior decent on the next batch of gs why are they not doing that yet come on bmw is the only luxury coupe maker with an entry level convertible no the a4 is not a consideration that porky pig vwmobile love the sedan but find the coupe to be a sexy beaa i may never own a coupe at my height 911 is never gonna happen until i shrink my crx had moe legroom than my g tho  no back seat you were sitting on a beach chair in that car with my 38 inch legs upto my cheeks sorry off topic 3series convertibles cool always were pray that they have come to their senses wow i have never read a review like that about a coupe cramped interior its a coupe what did you expect and for a coupe it has a very spacious interior what coupe in your opinion has a spacious interior lack of a trunk again its a coupe and i can get my golf bag and two suitcases in there and if thats not enough i could drop the backseat although i havent had to do that yet cheap interior  well that seems to be a universal thought but i happen to like the interior and i love the nav system and its location but you are right some of the interior materials could be scratched very easily  i tread lightly in mine with any sharp objects balky shifter well maybe a notchy shift action but ok and lastly numb steering   numb steering this is my biggest beef  no way the steering is excellent almost perfectly weighted and neutral to draw a comparison i would compare it closely with the 3 series steering of old not the new active steering that they have now my father in law has a 99 328 and i have always loved the handlingsteering feel is his car and the gs steering feels the same but hey at least we agree that the styling is second to none and btw according to my infiniti dealer the g35 convertible should hit the showrooms by 06 what coupe in your opinion has a spacious interior 3 series coupe is spacious i wouldnt own one but its pretty darn roomy not enough space in the trunk the rear suspension is so high that the trunk is essentially unusable balky shifter well maybe a notchy shift action but ok not too much of a knock i think bmw has worse trannies and i still bought a 330i i at least trust the nissan tranny will last and lastly numb steering   numb steering this is my biggest beef  no way the steering is excellent almost perfectly weighted and neutral to draw a comparison i would compare it closely with the 3 series steering of old sorry the steering reminded me of the is300  dead no feedback and very slow to respond to inputs to each his own but hey at least we agree that the styling is second to none gorgeous styling id like a character line in the middle of the door but other than thatwow and btw according to my infiniti dealer the g35 convertible should hit the showrooms by 06 oh yummy one more choice when the bimmer goes back to the dealer a g35 convertible could be the hottest thing on the road in a long time of course if theres an bmw m2 coming and mazdaspeed3 hatchback out ill have so many fun choices looking forward to 2006 3 series coupe is spacious ha thats cuz its not really a sports coupe now is it  its a sedan door with 2 doors missing infiniti got it right when they made the two very distinct yet they are really the same insidejust like all of usok no more beer at lunch as far as steering goes there is only one question were you on pain killers or driving a bogus wrecked demo i find the steering to be off on all gs to be honest but it was worse in the coupe very dead center feel to it no feedback and slow to react not a criticism just how it felt to me i found the steering of the 3 and the tsx far more engaging heck recently the steering setup on my protege feels more responsive and better than that of even my 3 series zhp but thats more related to those wretched slick pathetic potenza s03s also the substantial weight of the cars plays a role the most engaging car on the road that ive driven is still without a doubt the miata point and shoot flick it left right sideways  you move that wheel and the car reacts without pause or shifting of weight or lumbering along like the g35 and 330i do were not talking about acceleration or wot noise were talking about a steady 70 mph cruise say what you want but 75 dba is loud and tiring after many hours in the car any continuous sound over 6466 dba causes hearing loss over time if you are smart you will wear ear plugs on longer trips if it looks anything like the 350z id pass i hate all these convertable sports cars that have a cowl line even with your ear lobes and the top of the windshield covering half your head and then every time i see someone driving one with the topdown they have all the windows rolled up why bother i think a convertable should actually be open like a miata or alfa romeo spider i noticed that in my buddys g35he has the sport package and the road noise was really amazingly loud i love wot engine noise but i often take 4 hour highway drives and i know how tiresome the droning can bemy old car did it and 5 hours was draining of course if youre having fun its not a problem altima also has buttonedup styling and i believe it was the first to show the asymmetrical slanted crease running below the beltline that many have hitchhiked onto and most have botched bingo i made this same point about everyone adopting this crease a little while back mercedes 2005 slk toyotas sienna hondas accord cadillacs new sts and cts all have it and upcoming mercedes and vws will have it too and just like you stated with varying degress of success i personally dont care for this styling element on mercedes where is pure fluffery but it does work on some of the japanese cars probably because they had nowhere but up to go in terms of styling it works on the altima m this must be a coupe thing as the wheel wells are in the interior rear deck area my sedan is a joy at 100  even quiet music is audible and conversations are quiet at that speed do you have the sport package thats the one thing i really remmeber from driving the cts with the 36l really quiet too much so in fact for me also slightly uncommunicative but the one i drove didnt have the sport package that might cancel out my two main objections yes  wind noise is pretty great and so is cruising engine speed its loud when you put your foot in it and thats it ps i have the 350z intake tube so i have a louder sound than most sedans do the coupe has diff exhasust and that may be more dramatic than an intake from the passenger and driver perspective there are only 3 things that really turn me off from getting a g35 ever\\nmaterial quality is crappy\\nseats are really hard and uncomfy particularly on longer trips\\nride is harsh for a sedan at this level\\nbtw im talking about the sedan never tried the coupe but i like it more that its brother 350z dhanley how does the cts handle compared to others like bmw and g35 i had a hard time gauging how it handled it felt very like a german car it felt a lot like a cclass a bit better steering but more isolated but the cclass i drove that day had a sport package and the cts didnt who knows those gm card points may yet come in handy daver the sports sedan with the hard ride  duh  try out the avaolon or the stratus then what are you responding to one of the nice features of some cars is good handling plus not being bone shakers typically you pay extra for that while i didnt find the g35 sedan with sports to be rough many people complain about it people also return 330is with the performance package as they say the ride is too rough people are weird there is an inverse relationship between handling and ridethis is an axiom of sports sedan performance oddly enough the sports package with the harder firmer ride is better to live with than the non sports which rolls and bobs the g35 has a more planted feel than any car with 4 doors that i have driven  thats what makes the car feel luxurious to me if you want cush  this car is not for youits going to tranfer some road and uneven pavement vibration to the passenger the enthusiast prefers it this way hell bmw invented it many people dont like the 540 sport package ride either they have town cars for them folks many people dont like the 540 sport package ride either they have town cars for them folks chris its a matter of degree bmw has the spectrum covered from nonsport automatic setups up to the ms most people appreciate the basic tight bmw sedan ride without wanting blueplate performance its a midway point between the luxury ride and the sport ride blueguy\\x85 you think the miata is cool now youre talkin real sport driving ever drive an s2000 which avalon are you talking aboutcouldnt be toyotas because i have rented that car on numerous occassions and it drives like a ls 400 there is absolutely no harshness to that car 330i w std sport suspension is nice perf package would be a nice stuff to have but not for me as i drive long distance quite often\\ng35s overly firm seats arent doing any good for me cant say much about the mediocre comfort on long trips as i drove long distance w this car only twice\\nhonestly its actually funny as im not that old yet but i find german cars comfortable seats more relaxing and its becoming a must for mesomehow\\nmaybe daily stress from work is catching up on me i146ve owned both a 3146er sedan with sport suspension and now own a g sedan with sport suspension i try to autocross at least once per year finnally getting the g on the track when i was in germany the bmw went to hockenheim and nurburgring i will say right now that the bmw has a better balance of firmness and compliance in everyday driving but these are my on track observations the bmw will hit precisely on the marks lap after lap the bmw understeers slow speed corners can be a challenge because the chassis must be 147flicked148 into the corner by this i mean as you come into a slow sub 30 mph tight corner the balance of the bmw must be purposely upset to allow for better rotation of the nose normally this can be done with the throttle on most rear drivers but the bmw tucks it146s tail and digs during wot corner exit the suspension in the bmw is better at soaking up track irregularities mid corner bumps don146t usually cause you to run wide or have to lift for fear of rotation bmw sport suspension handles multiple corners like scurves very well threshold braking is linear with zero fade the bmw is surgical precise capable and unflappable having said all that about the bmw the g is ultimately more capable mostly because of more power it takes a better driver than me to wring out everything the g has to offer the g takes a few more course corrections the g is easier to modulate with the throttle the g can be coaxed to drift easier and superior torque can make for terrifying exit speeds i can run out of track and talent with the g146s go pedal tight corners can be dispatched easily with a touch of throttleon oversteer track irregularities can upset the g146s chassis during threshold braking and the rear can definitely step out on fast sweepers the g does not transition very well during multicorner maneuvers there is more bobbing as the dampers fight to control pitch and roll once the g is set though it146s time to dial in the throttle and rocket the g is powerful visceral involved and ultimately more rewarding to drive fast on a road course i believe a novice driver could drive a bmw and post better times than in a g a skilled driver in a g would post better times than in a bmw for me it would probably be a wash depending on the length of the straightaway ultimately i enjoy both cars greatly and am fortunate to have owned both and gotten to test each cars limits within a safe controlled environment blueguy\\x85 you think the miata is cool now youre talkin real sport driving ever drive an s2000 i love the feel of miatas like a gokart my family has owned at least one since 1991 so im pretty darn familiar with how them even the original with the tiny 113 hp engine was a blast no i havent driven an s2000 yet i will do so in aprilmarch of 2006 when i begin the quest for the bimmers replacement someone mentioned driving long distances and the perf package as roughactually on long freeway drives its pretty much like a normal 330i its on surface streets that it feels more jittery want a gocartbehold the lotus elise have you considered hotchkis sway bars for the g 250 shipped and as a trakkie you may enjoy them as much as i hear others are i may get them even tho i dont track her on road courses people say the rigididty over bumps is improved and the sway is nill  they are adjustable so you could also tweak the balance to oversteer from under which is stock even if the tail fliks easily you do give up some independence of the suspension but  whats a slightly harsher ride going to mean at this point anywayapparently its already like driving a nonsprung shoppping cart thats a killer car too bad its 40k thats a little steep for a car thats not even allweather capable not that it rains here well i finally test drove the 330i with performance package today in 6speed i had driven the g35 a few months ago but it was an automatic so i cant compare exactly my initial reaction was that it wasnt as fast as id hoped im used to a v8 mustang and while the bmw is quicker to 60 and 14 mile i think it has more to do with the higher revving engine and more consistent engine output whereas the v8 screams at 3500 rpms but gives up in the higher rmps anybody else think the g35s higher torque numbers make the car feel quicker im wondering if ill get bored with the bmw after a yeari must admit i wasnt used to the clutch so my shifts werent completely smoothmaybe once i get used to the car it will feel faster im not saying it felt slow it just didnt make my hair stand up the handling definitely was great and i like the interior much better than the g35 and i love the looks even though bmws are everywhere just curious what others think of the acceleration feel in these cars thanks i must admit i wasnt used to the clutch so my shifts werent completely smoothmaybe once i get used to the car it will feel faster im not saying it felt slow it just didnt make my hair stand up it never will really feel faster some bmw lovers will claim the engine loosens up and gets freerrevving after xxxxx miles yeah whatever the handling definitely was great and i like the interior much better than the g35 and i love the looks even though bmws are everywhere just curious what others think of the acceleration feel in these cars i still love driving mine but its doesnt feel fast to me any longer familiarity breeds contempt the ubiquity of the car grows tiresome too hi\\ni will be moving to portland or and purchasing a new car in about 152 months i had a few questions and would appreciate any pointers or suggestions currently i am a resident of pennsylvania philadelphia my choice is between the tl  g35 leather w premium pkgan 04 i35 w nav and cold weather pkg for  28k would be a third choice questions i what are typical additional fees dealers charge in oregon or to oregon residents buying in wa or ca for instance ii there is no sales tax on cars right for or residents iii what is a good time to buy a new car august september october due to 05 models and inventory reduction etc iv would it be unreasonable to expect to get an 04 non navi tl or 04 g35 leather w prem pkg for 32k all inclusive v how well does the argument of an 04 car being a year old and so it should be offered for lesser usually work in aug sept oct if the dealer has some 04 models onsite thanks again hi rsr152  welcome i see youre asking these questions in a few places but you might have missed the best place for most of them check out our smart shopper board thats the main place where the most of the issues you raise are best addressed meanwhile the g35 vs tl discussion you found is a great place to learn what folks thinks about how the features of each compare do take a look at the discussions on the ss board  im sure you can find answers to most of these questions that youve posted here and in the other two discussions good luck  feel free to drop me an email if i can help you find anything else i cant say anything about ur first question but i can share some infos i have on the others yes its true theres no sales tax for or residents and depending on the area 05 models usually hit the dealerships around early sept here im in wa\\nim not sure about the g35s price but as far as i know getting a tl for 32k is reasonable while imo you can actually go a little lower once the 05s are on the lot i almost bought a tl myself heck it was hard to negotiate back then since there were only a few units in the inventory and lots of buyers\\nno i dont think you can really consider a new 04 as a 1 yr old used but you can get some nice deals out of it id say you can get bout 10002000 off the price\\nnote that some dealers just want to get the older cars off the inventory thats where you can get some nice deals has anyone wondered which brand is going to he right direction in their products design sales etc\\nlately i found cadillacs bold and daring design growing on me too bad the interior is still a mess in the cts and performancewell its getting better\\notoh bmws starting to turn me off with their lame idrive and minimalist controls active steering also a chore to drive with\\naudi is getting nice a little minus with their bassmouth grille i say go easy with the chrome lid on the grille and it will look a whole lot better does anyone here know if the zephyr is gonna be produced or not cos im pretty sure i spotted one down the road few days ago i didnt realize what it was until i browsed through edmunds\\nhell i thought its just a concept car  and isnt it supposed to be fords concept the zephyr is being produced i asked the same question to a few friends at ford it seems theyre doing calibration testing currently to make sure that it can pass govt fuel emission standards i believe theyre adding in a 35 duratec once the development is done it should be ready by mid 2005ford is getting the ford fusion which is based off the mazda 6 but trust me it doesnt look like the 6 at all go look on yahoo for ford futura concept pictures and thats what itll look like ive seen the fusion in real life and its a head turner as for mercury theyre getting the mercury milan which is a redone fusionfutura theyre redoing the body for a more premium look in other words the milan is actually going to be a unique car to mercury glad to help you out i posted this elsewhere but i want to get some additional feedback    i looked today at a 2002 mb c320 sedan it looks like i could get it for around 25k which seems to be a dang good price based on what i got from nada based on the vin they had it booked at 29625  retail  and 25775  tradein before i do anything nuts i thought id ask a few questions    1 the car has 27000 miles on it so it still has a ways to go on the warranty anyone have any experience with mb dealerships on how willing they are are to honor warranty issues from second or third owners of the vehicle 2 there seem to be lots of questions about quality on this board i know its annoying when a quality vehicle gives you grief but it also sounds like the vehicles under warranty are getting problems fixed without too much trouble am i right or am i missing something 3 i gotta know more about the cell phone thing my guess is that it will only work with a specific mb approved cell phone provider right theres no way to get my us cellular number to work with this thing is there 4 any other advice from those of you who have bought a used mb cclass vehicle thanks for your help peter ill be interested in hearing the answers to your questions rumour has it that mb will be bringing the e320 over with the turbodiesel and having driven a number of recent rental diesel vehicles in europe im intrigued rumour has it that mb will be bringing the e320 over with the turbodiesel its not a rumour i think theyre already selling them in fact rumour has it that mb will be bringing the e320 over with the turbodiesel i dont think its a rumor edmunds got one tested already if im not mistaken peter i cant tell you much regarding the warranty issues on 2nd owners but my parents always have at least one merc in their garage and everytime it has problems they get fixed w barely any questions just a reminder mercedes are just like other german cars expect some minor problems including electrical issues greetings all i have been following this board for over a year and have found the discussions both interesting and insightful this fall i intend to purchase either a new 05 240 elegance or bmw 325i i have only owned and driven corollas in the past on average keeping them 12 yearsthey have only ever been great cars in terms of reliability they are my standard but im ready to try something more upscale now and after a fair amount of research it has come down to the 2 fine cars mentioned above i intend to keep my next car for 10 years i will only put lowcity mileage on it will get the extended warranty and expect to pay it off within 1 year  my first choice or the choice of my heart would be the 240 but i am concerned about the recent consumer reports ratings of the car i know that the 01 and 02 years are of greater concern on this how has the reliability been for those who bought 03 and 04 model years  i guess my close 2nd choice or the choice of my head would be the bmw its a little more sports sedan im more of a touring sedan type myselfand it has very high ratings from most automotive sources at any rate i would appreciate your thoughts thank you b most auto magazines make their reviews based on handling and performance or at least more into the performance factor\\nive heard of quite a number of people complaining about the pre04 cclass seats being uncomfy on longer trips but i heard they fixed it since the 04 model\\nreliability isnt far from bmws which in this case if you drive only nonpermissible content removed cars so far is gonna be a pain in the butt if you wanna keep it for 10 years\\nbut even if youre more into touring the bmw is still a fine choice just a bit less comfy than the mercedes in the ride department\\nin any case id say take a test drive before you decide i tend to think reliability is overblownyes a corolla may be more reliable than either of these two carsbut it also might not be the reality of it is that the vast majority of cars out there and probably all the ones in this topic are within a statistical deviation of each other so just buy what you like and gets you the most bang for your buck theres cars out there that are cool enough that i almost wish my 3er would give me an excuse to trade it i really like the cclass overall if the c230 had just a little bit more oomph dave get the c32 amgmy friend has one and it has some oomph to it from anecdotal evidence i would say the bmw will be cheaper to maintain than the mercedes if you keep it for ten years resale isnt that important but if you do happen to get rid of it earlier the 3series will hold its value better than the cclass something that might sway you bmw will soon be offering manufacturer extended warranties that bump the coverage to 6yr100k miles and you can also extend the free maintenance coverage to match that time period the extended warranty is 2249 and the extended maintenance plan is 995 except for future price increases you can buy that coverage for the same price at any time before your original warranty and maintenance plan run out i wouldnt discount the bmw just because you are a touring type of person just stay away from the sport package one of the 3series strengths is how well it combines handling with a good ride regards\\nkyfdx i purchased a 2002 c320 in december 2003 and also got a great deal paid about 28k and this one was fully loaded with the cd changer phone cradle heated seats etc best things was it only had 10k miles on it couldnt believe it 1 service with mercedes benz has been great the car is still under warranty and coverage has never been an issue even though i am not the original owner i have 20k miles on it now and still have till 2006 or 34k more miles to go to the warranty and regular maintenanceoil changestire rotation are all free 2 i have taken the car in for a a few things and they have gone above and beyond the cupolder has chrome button marked push that was chipping so they replaced it instrument had a smudle so they replaced it spare tire cover plastic handle was broke so they replaced it only problem i have had is there was a whining noise when i would make a turn and turns out it was the power steering they replaced the power steering pump best thing is they also give you a free rental car while your car is being serviced 3 i have the phone cradle for a motorola v60 i was thrilled when i got the car because i already had a v60 but then i found out that it has to be a mercedes benz v60 you know its a contract between mb and motorola so they have to get you somehow i found the phone on ebay for about 200 and its been worth every penny i have service through verizon and live in ca love being able to answer the phone handsfree through the radio speakers and dial through the number pad on the radio 4 bottom line i love the car had it for 7 months now and dont regret buying it what i can recommend is that while its under warranty take advantage of fixing any problem no matter how small ive always driven hondas or nissans but this car is a lot of luxury in a compact affordable package thanks for all the great feedback i just keep getting more and more excited about the prospect of owning this car i hope to nail things down this weekend ive already had a great experience with mb customer service i called our local dealership to ask a couple of questions  including whether or not they might be able to provide me with information about the service record not only were they willing to do that even though i wouldnt be buying the car from them but they faxed it over to me although there have been about a dozen things done to the car over the last year all were done under warranty and all but one were more cosmetic than anything else the one thing that looked kinda major was something labeled rubber mount torsion bar im going to give them a call to find out a bit more but i suspect it wont keep me from moving ahead with the purchase assuming i can bring the price down just a bit more thanks again the more systems a things has the more potential for problemsissues so benz bmw and etc tend to have a lot of features and gadgets that could have issues over time some makers like lexus seem to be able to get more things right the first time but is far from perfect my uncle had to special order his corolla to get one without electric windows he figured he would have the car for a long time and it was one less thing that could break was really interested in a tl did the test drive etc until by chance i visited the local saab dealer they were offering a leftover 2003 95 aero with every option imaginable for 32 color is metallic green with gray interior had 100 miles on it with plastic still on the seats etc to make a long story short and after a lot of haggling i ended up buying this car for 27500  tax i test drove this car the same day as the tl and i honestly loved both cars equally apples and oranges i couldnt justify spending the extra 2500 minimum to get the tl in other words the tl didnt blow me away to the point where i was saying this is the car i must own i am on a tight budget so this figure was ideally the amount that i wanted to spend on a car yes it is an 03 not an 04 but at that price i couldnt turn it down will pick up the car this monday august 6 and i hope this will be the beginning of a new long and fruitful relationship with saab i know i would have loved the tl as well but for this time around i am going swedish not japanese i am trading in my 98 eclipse gst with 136k miles i will miss my little eclipse jmess you wrote some makers like lexus seem to be able to get more things right the first time but is far from perfect wife and i have now put on about 30000 miles in our is300s not a single problem nothing nada zip in the first 40000 miles my wifes former 323ia had various issues like with sunroof seats and cd player hoping they are like our former 1996 g20ts over 80000 miles and never a single problem my wife and i just got back back this enjoyable event i drove a lexus gs430 mb s430 infiniti g35 lexus is300 bmw 330i lexus ls430 acura tl lexus es330 impressions gs430  good power and good handling nice but outdated interior layoutdesign cd changer in glovebox poorly designed center consolestorage etc this car needs to be restyled inside and out s430  nice power and surprisingly good handling for such a large carthis car really attacked the corners interior was high class but somewhat colduninviting with some quirky ergonomics g35  best drive of the bunch brakes very grabby took some finesse but wonderful power exhaust note and cornering interior layoutquality is this cars achilles heel it was a 2004 is300  not as hard edged as i remember light and nimble handling decent power yet at a disadvantage vs competition interior looked and felt cramped uninviting and lowrent well my wife liked the speedometer 330i  more powerful than is300 but softer around the edges handling and drivetrain wise slightly more mush in the steering suspension and throttle response interior a step or two up from is300 and g35 but still looked and felt dated and a little cheap ls430  the car id choose if i had to commute in traffic or took a lot of trips plush warm and inviting interior suede headliner big comfy seats everything softtouch nice straightline power but a pig in the twisties tl  the car id choose if i had to commute in traffic or took a lot of trips but only had 30k to spend basically felt like a lowerrent ls430nice power and plush modern interior but soft driving dynamics es330  my wife drove this one she liked it i didnt a camry dressed in lexus clothing conclusions if someone could build a 30k ish car that drivessounds like the g35 and has the interior of the tl theyd get my money ps the longest line was for the cadillac xlr its kinda ugly but it goes like heck sounds awesome and corners on rails nice writeup if i could be driving an ls430 i would be driving a 745 if my budget was an absolute 30k it would be a loaded honda i would rather drive a loaded honda than a stripper 325 if i had 40k the 3 series performance package you should seriously consider lexus if longterm reliability is a concern official photos of the next 3 have been released less controversial looking than the 5 or the 7 and has a little more pizzaz than the current 3 not what evokes wow beautiful or handsome but not bad either but im not a big fan of the new interior seems pretty bland there seems to be both a idrive version and a nonidrive version at least for euro models of course ill have to reserve final judgment until i actually see the car and sit in it not what evokes wow beautiful or handsome but not bad either its a much more modern handsomeathletic design than the now date 6 year old 3 series i think theyll be gorgeous in person because the color of the car in the pics makes it look downright bland jrock do you have any links to the pictures of the new 3series look on the 2006 bmw 3 series board for links to pics did you have a chance to drive a cadillac cts or the new sts i think the cts with the new 36 is a better choice than the g35 if they were equal in price but a similarly equipped to the teeth g35 is like 5k less than the cts which runs into the 40s it would be intersting to see how the sts does against the 430 aswell did you check the rear end looking like a cheap nissan or hondas rear end design the xlr was the only cadillac there i would have liked to have seendriven the new sts as for the cts they could put a fusion power unit in it and it would still be ugly to me i have been lurking in vain for the answer to my questions i would appreciate some feedback if possible i live in colorado and need to know if there are any other coloradans or people that have driven i70 over eisenhower tunnel in a 325i loaded with people 10000 ft up i used to have a honda prelude w a power to weight ratio of 1hp to 193 lbs and the 325i has a 163 power to weight i would be luggin extra weight due to 4 people the honda did just fine if you dipped into the power band a little bit the honda was geared a little on the high side like the 325i relative to their respective competitors id like to buy new and the 325i is the most i can afford mention a new 330 and just break out the drool cup im looking at this being a 100k car thats why i am not looking at a used 330i somehow id feel cheated if i spent all that money and couldnt get up the hill but the bmw has plenty of torque and horsepower for any highspeed driving you need to do if your prelude could handle it you have nothing to worry about with 325i regards\\nkyfdx check out the 05 subi legacy gt you get awd for the co winters and a turbo to give you the high altitude performance you are looking for i agree that the subaru would have the power especially with the turbo giving such outstanding high altitude performance i read the first drive on the front page of edmunds and wasnt impressed with the engine review i drove the 325 the other day and be still my beating no pounding heart it drives like people say it does im not too worried about the winters we get the most sunshine out of any magor city in the us all things being equal i want the bmw my only other contender is the tl but 270 out of a fwd thanks for any input kasperghost you could wait until the 333 hp twin turbo 3 series comes out im sure jmess would agree it would have enough power seriously though cr likes the new tl for 33 grand you get a lot of car however if you want that feeling of connectedness to the road and be able to predict the cars very next move the bimmer is for you a friend has the has the new tl you know what he raves about the bluetooth phone and the dvda i didnt hear one word about the cars handling to me thats the difference between people who buy bimmers and people who dont you will never confuse a bimmer to an acura on toys and you will never confuse an acura to a bimmer on handlingprecisionroad feel i am a honda man but am looking for more excitement i understand that the bmw will cost more to own and i can deal since i have given up motorcycles i need to feel the need somehow somehow i think i could deal with a 333hp turbo that bmw produced forget drool cup drool bucket i am just a little concerned that the 184 hp w 4 people wont cut it at 10000 ft cars lose approx 1 sec of 060 time per mile of altitude i am sure having fun agonizing though i saw two 3series on a truck the other day and almost caused a wreck well i used to drive my 328i in the mountains in coloradonew mexico quite often and i never felt low on power the new 325i has almost the same horsepower but less torque though my turbo saab had more mountain horsepower same as sea level due to the turbo but the lag was awful in the mountains if you dont mind using 3rd or 4th at times to climb hills youll be fine dave if you like a car to the point of drooling over it you should definitely get it i dont live in colorado so obviously i dont know about the hill youre talking about but i doubt the 325i will have too much trouble getting over it no doubt there are many lesspowerful 4 cylinder vehicles that make it up and down that hill just fine obviously the 325i will have to work harder than a 330i g35 or tl but it cant be that bad es330  my wife drove this one she liked it i didnt a camry dressed in lexus clothing does your wife agree with you on that and still like it we used to drive both and id have to say es is a lot more comfy and plush than camry for 30k id like something between es and tl although i can see why youd like one between g35 and tl since i have given up motorcycles\\ni need to feel the need somehow i also recently gave up my twowheeled bmw for a fourwheeled one 325i and so far have not missed the mocycle all that much theres still many things about the mc experience that no car can replace but overall i am enjoying the cage experience now cleaner dryer safer   doug g i own a 03 95 aero and would probably go for the hirsch kit were it available in the us too bad as is the 95 is probably the best kept secret within this category you have to own one to truly understand i drove all of em and the saab does it all the deals are also outrageous through the end of august re my wife yes she basically agreed though she has less time invested and interest in closely examining the finer details of a car she warms to a car that is handsome comfortable and easy to drive this es was a special edition and had a dark grey coloured trim in place of the usual wood i like warm natural colours in a luxury car like the woodtaupe interior of the ls 430 and felt that the dark leather interior with dark trim made the interior feel drab and uninviting she had no strong opinion on the interior one way or the other we both agreed that the seats like other toyotas we have driven were too short no thigh support and hard they were reminiscent of the uncomfortable seats we disliked in the highlander we test drove last january since she was driving i had a chance to look around the cabin more i said it was like a camry because the headliner material moonroof surround trim and sliding cover and plastic trim pieces map lights visor mirrors dashboard etc were made of typical camryaccord quality no better i admit i would have liked it more if it had a natural wood trim but overall it just didnt look or feel like a 35000 car re estl tweener yes take a tl give it the interior space and quiet ride of the es and youd have a fine touring car yeah i am sure one can always find some traces of their lessfortunate cousins on one of these lexus acura infinity or audi but ive looked around all the 30k cars and found that es to have the nicest interior materials that provide the most comfort tl is 2nd with a4 also decent enough others are really so so if you think es interior cheap already i dont know which 30k can you find justified interior wise btw es does come with more inviting interior color with real wood trim you ought to read more reviews on the new turbo legacyoutback better yet go test drive one you dont have to but it will be your loss the legacy gt will handily out perform a 325xi period  the the 325 is\\n1 much better looking\\n2 probably has a better overall feel do you mean faster so what and the 325xi that is probably bmws worst performing 3series can the subie duplicate the road feel and balance of a 325i if it can it will be the first one httpmotoringiafricacomcarsinactionshootout291844htm ok let me throw in the 328 and 330  i have worked over 325s in the canyons of la with an old style legacy i mean neutral handling feel grip the us legacy has always been a chassis in search of a motor the japan and euro spec legacies have always been known for their driving experience yeah and in the 80s you could get an amc reliance gta that had more grip than a corvette due to its tirewheel setup would i compare them no but someone would would i want one over a corvette no again can boris said outdrive me even in a geo metro probably but i still wouldnt buy one regards\\nkyfdx\\nwho really likes subarus seriously when i get the impression the legacy takes over the title of the best sports sedan ill get it but first it has to dethrone the tl i think its great the a new legacy can finally beat a 6 year old bmw design honestly i think the upcoming twin turbo three series should just about change the equation but i can here it nowwhat about the value i am still waiting for the comparos to come i really like the tl but its match with the legacy is coming  what did bmw put out their new 5 series with a hidden 6 year old design bangle had some stuff in the can i guess look i like the 3 series and the tl a bunch the dude before owes it to himself to drive all the great choices out there of which the legacy is one of the best hey if you dont like subies hey more power to you  bmw as never about 060 yes the offer rockets but its about a balance of luxury and sportiness and driver connection with the road actually the dude can do what he wants he may be like me and know his next car is either german or american lots of great choices from both sides but im skipping japan this time around if you want to convince yourself the new legacy is a better car than the 5 series go for it ill be more than happy to let you blow past me while i think the comparison with the 95 areo makes sensei think the areo is a great car comparing it and a 530to a subaru gt really doesnt work if were choosing any sedean based on grip and power carsdirect can get me a 6speed gto for 31190  it even beats the legacys combined 21mpg too  when both use stick  this is still luxury performance and theres more to that than 060 times dave i agree the point is not 060 it is driving feel connection to the road and experience the bmw has always excelled at the crosshairs of sportiness and luxury you can keep on convincing yourself that no other car compares but this new legacy like the acura tl and the g35 is finally doing the same now comparing the legacy to the 5 series is a huge stretch as admitted in the article referenced but it just goes to point to the significance of the legacy yes the aero is nice2003 aero wagon owner  it needs stiffer springs to be a true canyon carver but overall it is pretty under appreciated\\n \\ngo test drive a legacy gt limited you will be surprised at the interior i have my disappoinments with it though it doesnt have nav or the onstar that was removed it also needs backup sensors and hids although the projector beams are bright enough people we are talking middle class everymans percieved luxury there is not a whole lot of differnce in the materials of all these cars including the subaru now i know the legacy was tossed out of this discussion a while back as i campaigned for its inclusion so i will bow out i kind of feel like stem cell supporters at the republican convention okay last comment of mine perceived luxury there is no such thing perceived luxuryperceived value of house the wrx has been compared to a 100000 porsche in the mags does that make it so i have never heard anybody say in real life  porsche  70k wrx in order to be considered an entry level luxo not a perceived entry level luxo the is have to be dotted and the ts have to be crossed its inside and well as outside while magazine reviews never enter into my buying decisions they are good for trends and informational sources when the entry level luxo list list for sports sedans is\\n bmw acura infiniti caddy subaru saab etc and the subaru comes out on top thats when ill note them to be given their due some nerves have been touched is it easier to make the cheap guys good or the good guys cheap appears some of the cheap guys are working to get better im not going to hold my breath for the other piece of it the car market has substantially changed over the last 1015 years the expensive guys are going after the less expensive turf the less expensive turf players are looking to get into the more expensive turf saying either camp iswill be successful is a matter of time to understand if the effort is successful somehow just as many potshots have been taken on both sides as so far the product produced seems like there are just as many nerves touched on one side as the other as we all have our respective opinions only time will tell as bmw completes its product announcements over the next couple of years it will be an interesting time for them i dont think all car manufacturers wont know until about 20072008 if their transformation has been on target dont know if you mean me i just didnt want to rehash all the what belongs in the topic discussion if you want to post a is the 2005 legacy a luxury car topic ill read it it ought to be interesting i look forward to both highline models becoming more affordable and affordable models becoming more highline i figure that either way we win there is a volvo dealer very close to me and i admit the new s40 is growing on me if there really is a 300hp awd version in the works that ought to be interesting 300hp awd 300hp is nothing these days all a manufacturer has to do is increase the redline the hard part is getting 300 hp without making the car seem like a windup toy while keeping the overall gas mileage with hard acceleration in the mid20s i agree that you want tractable power  my bmw salesman thinks the z3 30l was more fun than the z3m in most situations  not just power but to me 300hp is not nothing its overkill to the point of frustration for 99 of driving i find cars like the vette sort of fustrating because not only can you not use all the power but you can hardly wind the engine up without getting arrested basically the s40r would have the same drivetrain as the s60r  httpwwwedmundscomnew2004volvos60r100278288roadtestarti clehtmlarticleid101293 but in a smaller more nimble car dave most of the new awd cars with 300hp dont have high redlines 60007000 max like a good majority of cars the sti the s60v70r both have normal redlines i believe the same is true for the s4 db needless to say you probably dont need more than 200250hp to have great fun in a sports sedan but as the sports luxury cars get a bit heavier with all the luxury and safety for example the audi s4 need the benefit of the additional hp but this power is tractable you just need a track to get all tractable power usage  has anybody driven or purchased the new c55 yet i have went to a 3 local dealers and they all dont have any when asked about how i can test drive one to see if the ride is what im looking for they told me they only way they would get one in if i ordered one i cant see putting a deposit downorderingwaiting 2 monthsthats the dealers time line not mine to find out if i either love it or hate it if anybody had any ideas let me know thank you drive a c430 figure the c55 will ride a little rougher be a little louder and marginally faster and the insurance rates will be much higher ive owned several bmws mostly 3 series most recently an 01 x5 which just went off lease in the past when my bmw lease was up id either turn it in and pick out a new one or purchase the old one  not this time i liked the x5 never had a problem with it but grew tired of driving an suv type vehicle and decided a sport wagon would fit my requirements the 3 series is too small and due to be replaced next year dont care for the 5 at all id decided on an audi a4 avant ultrasport  had one on order then i happened upon the legacy gt wagon my first test drive was an eye opener it reminded me of a bmw steering handling power delivery amenities material quality etc on the way home from the test drive i started doubting my perception of it  it couldnt have been that good when i got home the latest issue of bimmer magazine was in my mailbox imagine my suprise when the bimmer editor had test driven the new legacy gt at laguna seca with a bunch of other cars  here are the comments driving on public roads tends to reveal less about a cars performance than driving on a fast track like laguna seca but the first days driving in the hills east of monterey yielded at least one revelaton\\nthe subaru legacy gt has become a genuine rival to the 3 series not only has subaru made incredible strides where interior quality is concerned but the car is fast 250 hp from its turbocharged 25liter flat four and involving its a thoroughly engaging drivers car with precise neutral handling and perfect steering so i wasnt going nuts after all  took the gt wagon manual for another test drive confirmed my earlier impressions signed on the dotted line and cancelled the audi a month later im still very satisfied with my choice  waiting till 3k for the first oil change is there such a car as a c430\\nis that in the mercedes line there is no such car as a c430 if you are talking about the e430 they changed it to an e500 and that is a bigger car i was just assuming he was talking about the clk430 and i didnt even check the ebay listing close i just assumed that was the coupe as well who would have guessed that there was a demand for the c55 especially since the old c43 was such a bust before you learn something new everyday hey at least i found one in stock regards\\nkyfdx this board is great with all the knowledge and different opinions of everyonesome people are more opinionatedemotional than others but thats ok\\nwhen i buy a car i plan to keep it for at least 7 to 10 yearsbonus if longerthe audi was stuck in my head as my first choice for my next carbut i had not done any researchshopping around for 5 years\\ni cross shopped almost every single car even though some posters would say people would never cross shop those carsyou can always learn something with an open mind\\nthe legacy gt opened my eyes at the auto showthe subaru test drive event was the clincher\\nit doesnt matter that the legay gt is not one of the cars on the header of this forumgo back and read post 1 and decide for yourself be happy rickover  nice to hear someone who has driven a bmw 3 series does appreciate that the subarus have greatly improved since 1999 the us version legacy has always been a chassis in search of a motor they finally refined the whole package so now i am lobbying again for the subaru legacy gt limited for inclusion in this topic this is what edmunds editors say the bottom line now a legitimate entrant in the entrylevel luxury category the new legacy will change how people view the subaru brand\\n \\nbut i also think the volvo s60v70 r types should be included they fall in the same price range and luxury content range personally i think it would make more sense and i said before to start a tp is the subaru gt a luxury car if we open the topic it will just allow others to be considered for includion pontiac bonneville gto loaded camries and accords etc i drive a 3 series and have looked at the subies and while i have liked some aspect of them i havent others really cheap interiors poor gas mileage and boomy construction i havent looked at a 2005 so i cant ascertain if its improved but i wasnt impressed by the 92 dave why not add the kia amanti and the sonata gls\\nit is really getting ridiculous on this board go on keep talkin subies and youll get sent to the gulag archipelago youre messin with the entrylevelluxuryperformance kgb here entry lux cars come from the bottom of what that brand offers the g35 3 series is300 and c class are bottom of the barrel for their luxury brands they get you into a lux brand and from there the brand expects youll move up the cruddiest things made by bmw infiniti and mb are the 325 is300 and c you cant spice up your top end car and declare its now entry level lux entry level lux indicates theres something more expensive and better higher up to aspire to hence the word entry as long as the imprezza and forester are available from subaru and there isnt something on par with a 5e or 7a8 then its not a luxury brand and therefore they cant be selling an entry level lux entry lux cars come from the bottom of what that brand offers the g35 3 series is300 and c class are bottom of the barrel for their luxury brands they get you into a lux brand and from there the brand expects youll move up the cruddiest things made by bmw infiniti and mb are the 325 is300 and c ok fair enough by this standard i agree the legacy gt does not qualify so i am off to the new topic midsized midpriced performance sedans 20k50k msrp fully loaded  it seems like the most logical way to break it down the 3 series really is the entry level car for the bmw line nobody would call a 30k subaru  no matter how cool and fast  the entry level vehicle for that brand i just have read through 142 pages of post and your rule about what cars are included is stupid if every auto magazine in the world considers other cars entry lux than this thread should too for it to be a fair comparison also with that said the tl should be thrown out of this comparison because an rl is not in the class with a s or 7 series or an a8 therefore its entry is an tsx and its definitely sub par my sister owns one and its not in the entry level so other cars should be entered but it wont happen after reading 142 pages i have seen that you are very stubborn about the cars enlisted even if it is stupid well   i guess that settles it good thing toyota nissan and honda rebadged some of their cars into lexus infiniti and acura or else well only be allowed to talk about mainly european cars in this thread okay you know what were not just talking about the ones listed on the topic it can be any other brands that pretty much qualifies into the entry luxury category but then again i admit that the brand have some effects here or else id say is300 will never make it into this category nor the g35 both due to their crappy interior thats never up to the luxury standards id take altezza the real lexus is into the subaru category cant figure out why so many worry so much about what this boar is about the title is moderately self explanatory this board is about sedans that are both 1 performanceoriented and\\n2 entrylevel luxury so topoftheir line luxury sedans like acura rl dont qualify nor do nonperformance sedans like lexus es330 and coupes like the g35 coupe or gto are immediately disqualified so some of the best fits that immediately come to mind are sedans like the 325i g35 and is300 then others like the xtype or cclass come to mind does that mean there will be some gray area like with the acura tsx and tl sure but that is part of the fun of trying to compare cars entry level is from the perspective of buyer not the car manufacturer its the other way aroundmanufacturer not the buyer\\ntell you what i am going to shop tomorrow for a nissan altima 25 sthen take it work and show it to my coworkers and saylook at my new entry level luxury car\\nthey

m3 minus 20k is less the car that the sti is period look subaru is quite capable of adding all the luxury that bmw has they can add 510k worth of wool leather aluminum alcantra momo sparco nakamichi nav mcintosh stereos whatever very few would buy it at the start so its not worth the investment subaru is building the brand towards more luxury yes i have driven both and yes the m3 is super nice and way better looking imho but if you really had to make a run for your life in a car i would put my butt in a sti  will subaru ever have a full size luxury car i doubt it they will have a larger model than the legacy and it will probably have alot of luxury the crucial car for subaru now is the new 7pass halifax or tribeca that car has to come correct with alot of premiumluxury features and performance will they put all the bells and whistles in i dont know can they hell yes there is a 450hp subaru motor waiting for a car i like this thread it has the spice that alot of other threads have lacked and ps kyfdx i said i gave you the leeway in the rsx read my post over again and look at the part that said tsx is the bottom of the line actually rsx but i give you the benefit of a sedan oh yeah duh anyway i ask a question about the opinions of kyfdx and blueguy what are the definitions of a entry lux sedan and what are your definitions of one there is only one write answer one is opinion and one is set by societys standard which makes it factual lets get to the real nittygritty and leave out ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm yea the opinion and then lets compare or like someone said lets stick our head in the sand and act like our opinions out weight societys standards maybe in a dream world or when one of you becomes king of america oh yeah we live in a democracy sorry 147i like this thread it has the spice that a lot of other threads have lacked\\x85148 yeah well enjoy it while it lasts because i have to believe the regular forum host is on vacation when she gets back you146re all gonna be crackin146 rocks on a chain gain i lobbied for subie inclusion and got sent to the gulag this has been like a major revolt and breakout yeehaaaaaaa let 145errrrrrrrrrip be nice now\\x85 nice  yes but the in the prior post it indicates where the top of the line should compete is the sclass 7 series and a8 and not 5 a6  e class read the 142 pages then get back to me i mentioned the 5 and e i wrote 5e or 7a try again with your nitpicking entry level luxury the entry point to a luxury line subuaru is not a luxury line btw we live in a republic not a democracy the m3 has been named the best gt ever they are different cars one is a pocket rocket the other is interstellar spaceship with luxury you cant say a pocket rocket is better than an interstellar spaceship with luxury different purposes but if you believe the sti is a better car than the m3 i respect your opinion the sti is in no way better than an m3 and blueguy not nitpicking just stating the facts jack alot of bang for your buck but thats it it falls short everywhere else but performance yes fellow comrade i will try to get you reinstated into the politburo blueguy i understand where youre coming fromif timex comes out with a 100k watch is it a luxury brandprobably not is it a luxurious watch of course does it matter to the purchaser depends on the purchaser or the ultimate userwould a rolex afficionado look at a timex no ill admit even if hyundai comes out with a car that meets all the above criteria i would still never buy one even if they are more reliableluxuriouseveryone has theyre biases towards certain brands correctly or incorrectly this is why the luxury brands have to tread carefully if they decide to move downmarket eg bmw 1 seriesseparating ford from volvojaguar\\nin canada we have the acura el which is a gussied up civicso if we rebadge a car and all the cars in the lineup meet a minimum luxury level then we have a luxury brand good or bad thats what we have i totally agree with you i wouldnt say the scoobie gt is less of a car than a bmw i intend to drive one when my lease is nearing its end i want some measure of luxury matched with performance the badge is not too important to me when buying the car no american brands or mitsubishi neither is the market segment fun luxury and performance reliability would be nice tooespecially if i buy the next one heck the prospect of a mazdaspeed3 hatch with 270 hp awd and the space of that car has me drooling you can compare much more over at comparison of sedans priced 25000 to 45000 thread theres no reazson to take the exclusion of a brand as an affront it doesnt mean that the car might not be as good it just means it isnt the entry level of a luxury brand andor wasnt named by the moderator ive at least learned something in this topic i never even thought of volvos before but there was some interesting data on the s60r posted i had no idea it got to 60 in 55 an had such good performance numbers i will also look at the cts which i otherwise might not have really considered also the gt my cousin is lobbying for me to get a gto and i see no reason to not take a test drive but not every car i like has to be in every topic im interested in kd the m3 has been named the best gt ever what magazine came up with that tag i love the m3 dont get me wrong but when you say the m320k is ne to sti you are intimating that it would still be better than the sti that is an opinion i beleive to be false and hard to justify the sti can up the level of interior materials to the current legacy standard plus other extras like nav and still be under the optioned out price of a 330i it boggles my mind what subaru could do with an extra 20k on a sti not to mention what an sti legacy will be like my position is that if you add 20k to the sti despite its detriment in dimensions the m3 wouldnt be competitive as a small luxury compact gt and i mean it wouldnt be competitive in luxury and god knows it wouldnt in performance now do i beleive the current sti is better i beleive it is better fun for the purpose of all out driving however if i were single would i rather hit the town in a sti or a m3 convertible tops down on the m3 baby \\n  \\nbut if you believe the m3 is a better car than the sti i respect your opinion several pages dedicated to arguing about what it is were talking about thats really an argument that the discussion lost its focus and isnt going anywhere productive ya know as many of you know in order to stop the continuing debate about the debates i created a list of what is topical here  all of you had input but i made the decision the list pat mar 19 2004 634pm acura tsx and tl\\naudi a4\\nbmw 3series\\ncadillac cts\\ninfiniti g35 and maybe i35\\njaguar xtype\\nlexus is 300 and maybe es 330\\nmercedesbenz cclass\\nsaab 93 and 95\\nvolvo s60s60r and maybe s40 i see a couple of you have started other discussions to cover some of the bases not covered in that list thats great  maybe they will help us be able to talk about the cars themselves more often than we talk about which cars we are talking about do you really believe the m320ksti give me a break honestly drive both and then let us know  kd\\x85 i havent driven the sti but have driven the wrx m3 and 330i let me tell you something there are some people who are turned on by performance and dont need or want what is typically known as luxury it doesnt seem like this is your profile so i dont expect you to understand this when a performance driver gets going the only things that matter are go stop turn\\x85 the thrill of the roller coaster stereos fit n finish leather\\x85 all this stuff doesnt mean squat to this kind of driver these subies deliver some serious bang for the buck151performance for a helluva lot less to get the performance of both wrx and sti in a bmw you have to go to the 330 perf packm3 respectively and dish out the cash on the luxury aspect ive said this elsewhere some people classify luxury by way of buttpampering characteristics the thrill seeking driver sees naked performance as a luxury in itself this is why people are willing to pay ransoms for porsches that historically have had interiors on the level of military jeeps does this disqualify porsches as luxury cars not in my book do econobox characteristics detract from performance it merely puts it into the dubious entrylevel category keep denying this now kd i have to ask you have you driven the cars in question doesnt matter though\\x85 i think i know what you expect from a luxury performance car and i dont expect anyone who is thoroughly happy with a 330i to understand my points i understand your point but this topic is titled entry level performance sedans not value oriented performance cars i agree to some people its how fast to 60 how does it turn what is the traction and they dont care about any modicum of leather or wood others want the leather and trim i could have easily got the evo or sti as could all of us but that is not in our target frame of reference or else wed all be on the subie board telling everyone our lastest conquer with our sti there is no one better car car manufacturers design goals include a number compromises your purchasing goals want to minimize the compromises or tradeoffs and maximize the priorities aspects might include finances looks luxury reliability dealer service gas mileage etc\\nso you cant really say car a is better then car b in an absolute sense this is not about bmw vs the world its about saying an m3 and sti have as much in common as a lexus es and dodge srt4 anybody want to talk about the vehicles in the topic list this topic is titled entry level performance sedans not value oriented performance cars kd that really is the best way to describe it were talking about luxury and performance not luxury or performance there are differences between them subbies are about performance but not luxury honestly things got weird ever since subbie legacy got into this category in a place it shouldnt be why is there even a debate about this whether you agree with it or not the forum moderator has clearly stated an exclusive list of cars to discuss in this thread thematrixhasu please send me an email thanks cnn projects z convertible to have best resale value httpmoneycnncom20040823pfautoskbb_resale_valueindexh tm im rather surprised that class has some amazing german machines with everyone including porsche represented and is the z convertable a sport sedan what sport sedan in this group had the highest projected resale im making commodities future contracts due in 2010 based on those predictions i think someone had a diving rod out 2005 g35 rumor softer leather\\nauto sedan and coupe both with 280 hp\\n6mt sedan and coupe both with 298 hp not that the gs problem is power well i bet most people have been waiting forever for the softer leather since imo the current leather is darn stiffhard and the harsh ride just makes it worse any of you guys spent time behind the wheel of an s60r i sat in one at the autoshow and thought nice interior too bad its a boat i didnt think it was a 060 in 54 and 65mpg slalom car dave s60r is a boat it may go fast but it doesnt like it the turbo lag is impressive the brakes felt mushy it is very quiet good but it makes it hard to shift bad i actually got quite sea sick driving it the radio designer should be shot still it is pretty you wife with like it it is safe and resell is good you just will hate it until you resell it save 10 grand and look at the subaru legacy gt if you want performance or the acura tl if you want comfort both are good balanced players in power verses comfort a boat i havent heard that one yet it is fast handles well and is more comfortable than the legacy or tl both are very good but to call the s60r a boat is crazy minnehaha the legacy gt is a fine car especially going in a straight line on the highway where it reaches extralegal speeds in no time and feels good doing it significant body roll and understeer greatly reduces the fun factor for me but it is a car i might recommend as a comfortable family hauler the volvo s60rv70r however is in a different class altogether faster way more stable feels lighter much more agile very fun to drive in addition the exterior and interior aesthetic design as well as the quality of the interior materials particularly the leather are in another league enjoy the banter and wouldnt want to take you folks off the track of approved vehicles but the s60r is a very nice package indeed i bought an 04 xc70 in july a dog by comparison but drove the r series many times for comparison it flies and has a nicer interior vs the legacy to boot if it hadnt been for the narrow seats my problem with a cracked spine i would have plumped for it for the record we also owned a 325 and currently have a c320 both are different from the s60r but i sure wouldnt describe the latter as a boat john not a boat i say though the extremely complicated audio controls really turn me off kinda like volvo version of idrive\\nits a decent handler though no match to beemers or audi if you are gonna call these boats then they are nice speed boats  the interiors are great for these 2 models they are equal to the a4  a6 audis and better than the corresponding bmw and mb sedans i like these cars and the xc90 although i will probably never buy a volvo due to the crappy treatment i got from a dealer in santa monica a few years back i might eat my words when the xc90 with v8 comes out i do question the lighter feel and nimbler handling perception versus the legacy the legacy is lighter by 300 lbs they are way stable though and track turns well but nimble is not in volvo dna the steering feel in a legacy is more precise imho good brakes are standard for volvo though comparing to the benz or bmw in the price range for snow duty i would get the volvo comparing it to the legacy gt if you got the extra dough the volvo is awesome i think volvo did something good to have s60r and the new s40 esp t5 for the other swedan car maker saab they need to work harder many people think that their technology is outdated and the 93 interior not not good well i looked at the 2006 a4 report in edmunds yesterday it mentioned that audi added twin balance shafts that spin at twice the engine speed to a4 to minimize vibration balance shafts  sounds familiar i checked both my 2001 93  95 owners manuals and found that both cars were equipped with 2 balance shafts at that time i am not sure when saab put those in their cars i remembered i asked an audi salesperson whether the auto tranny of an a4 can learn the drivers driving style adaptive transmission  and he told me no i think saab has some nice and unique features that they didnt mention to people not that many people know saab came up the idea of headlight wipers heated seats etc the marketing dept should be responsible for that now 93 is more mainsteam maybe most people like it better than the old one i missed the hatch it needs something more than 210hp saab should create something like the viggen with awd for the 93 i heard there will be a 93 sport hatch but awd may not be an option hmmthat was how i felt about the 900 i used to have that car had lots of great features with a few glaring oversightsshortcomings i also had the bmw then which had fewer gee neat features and less utility  hatch interior room  but no real shortcomings i cared about for example the bmw engine didnt have that hammeryouinto the seat torque blast with that cool motorcycle sound but it didnt have the turbo lag either the saab was sort of a headache and i chose to keep the bmw but i miss that car in general i recently seriously considered getting either a 93 or a 95 i really like them both but each had something that made me say wait although i was contemplating pulling the trigger in each case once with a 95 aero  used 3000 miles  and the other time with a new arc both manual transmission the 95s bane was handlingturbo lag and the 93s was the el cheapo gm interior both could be fixed of course i think simply sticking the ecotec in the 95 would improve it a lot its a lighter smaller engine  for better weight distribution with less turbo lag the ecotec is also smoother another thing that irked me is the nature of the turbo with stick you have to shift really fast or boost is largely lost between shifts its find if youre driving all out but not so great for maneuvers in traffic sort of the opposite of the gto my cousin wants me to get even with my bmw i can start moving without using the gas just easing in the clutch while i felt quite choppy in both the saabs when starting off the lack of the hatch also miffed me still id rather have a car i really like with a few bugs than a car that is mostly reliable kind of like dating the awesome girl with a few issues vs miss boring and theres something about the saab that i at least want to like the new s40 really intrigues me it seems to have impressive environmental credentials which i know a lot of you probably dont care about that much so ill shut up about that dave saab 93 isnt bad actually ive driven one and id say its equal to volvos in handling im not a fan of hatchbacks so i surely wont miss it the only problem is im kinda concerned about the reliability\\nthe new s40 is a great handler better than any other volvos seems like its time for them to start competing w the germans\\nbut the problem is its unusually shaped its skinnynarrow and tall and the leather seats are overly firm for my taste i always thought that by seating in the car in the showroom you can only say how comfortable the interior is you on the other hand managed to get how the car performs that is impressive as for me i think that s60r has the most comfortable seats of any vehicles i had a chance to drive im not to crazy about the looks in and out but this car has so much to offer that i will consider buying it anyway it performs just as good and in many cases better than cars discussed on this board handling on the same page as 330 with performance package and at the same time if you switch suspension to comfort its as soft as a lexus not only it handles grate it also give you grate acceleration 060 in 55 and almost no turbo lag i always thought that by seating in the car in the showroom you can only say how comfortable the interior is you on the other hand managed to get how the car performs that is impressive where did i do that i sat in one at the autoshow and thought nice interior too bad its a boat i didnt think it was a 060 in 54 and 65mpg slalom car  did not you call it a boat its not a full size vehicle and you did like the interior so i guess boat would refer to the way the car feel on the road i thought i made it clear that i guessed that but learned otherwise from sources id quoted you know like how i might assume a ferrari is fast although ive never driven one volvo has a rep and a lot of reviews i didnt say anything that implied in any way that i could tell how it drives by sitting it it it might be a language issue if youre not a native speaker anyhow no reason to get upset i wasnt insulting the car dave why dont you go back to post and see what was quoted ill give you a hint nice interior too bad its a boat anyway i dont own the car and sertanly dont get insulted that easily it just looked funny the way you wrought it dont you get upset either its just a car forum not a wrighting class hi all i am getting close to making a decision on the above cars i had the 325i for a test drive of 2 days and must say it is very nice i found its over all ride and handling superb i will test drive the 240 elegance here in winnipeg canada next i would like your thoughts and feed back on a few things what are you impressions of the upgrades to the 05 240 i think they are great and long over due esp in the case of the cd player to me they really enhance the qualityappearance of the interior what options have you purchased and would purchase again and which would you not get again i intend to keep my options esp electronic to a minimum as i find the models well equipped and the less electronics imo the better i have found the stereo on my 14 year old toyota very good i am not an audiophile so would i notice or appreciate an upgraded sound system on either of these cars i dont expect the standard system to be excellent but is is at least good i have to say i find the exterior of the bmw very appealing over that of the mb but the interior of the mb has the bmw beat i love the comfortable sumptuousness of the mb interior my travel needs are modest i will only put low city miles on it will get the extended warranty will baby it and hope to keep it for 8  10 years while i think and feel both cars are excellent  i find both engines more that adequate for my driving needs i am inclined towards the 240 however my biggest reservation comes from concerns over mb quality i understand it is not what it has been i also understand that they are intentional about addressing this issue i also read the the c class was early on plagued with bugs this was esp true in the 2001 and possible 2002 model years can i assume that most of these c class bugs have been addressed what has been the experience of those who own 20020304 vehicles i dont expect a mb to be a good as a japanese car but i do expect it to be reasonably good and to hold its value over the long term i appreciate your thoughtsthanks b if youre gonna take good care of it both cars should last quite long with only minor problems\\nreliability like you said will never beat japanese brands but quite good overall with mb being a bit more reliable in my case 2005 mbs have new interior and seats since a lot of people complained about the seats hurting their back on long trips\\nsound systems in both cars are quite good if youre not an audiophile it has decent sound quality\\noptions id choose will always include xenon headlights a must wood trim now std in bmws and leather i usually opt for premium package but since you choose to skip the electronics you might not need it afterall\\nhope it helps if i were still living in winnipeg and consider getting a rwd car i would first consider the ground clearance the more the better i think the 240 has more clearance than the 325 then the next factor is winter tires options for the cars considered all season tires are not very safe for winter driving in a city like winnipeg and especially if you are going to baby it i would consider looking at the 4matic and the xi too just my 2 cents i146ve had my 14604 325i for about 5 months now so i feel qualified to evaluate it and compare it to my previous car a 14698 audi a4 18t these cars are similarly equipped manual trans nonsport package with allseasons about the same size and performance category so a comparison seems fair at this point engine 150 well the 325 is rated at 35hp over the a4 so it146s pretty much no contest the engine is also smoother and really begs to be revved the audi would spool up pretty well too but i always felt like i was straining it a bit i am also not sorry to lose the turbo as i have always felt they add complexity under the hood that could be a longterm problem in fact the only major repair that i had to pay for on the a4 was a 500 turborelated issue transmission 150 pretty even here with both being 5speeds the audi had a bit softer of a clutch vs the bmw146s abruptness i am only now at the point where i can consistently make a really smooth 12 shift handling 150 this is my first rwd car in many years and i forgot how different it feels the crisp turnin is especially noticeable and the steering overall has better feel than the a4 ridewise the cars are pretty comparable well controlled firm but never harsh over rough pavement typically german the one thing the a4 had going for it was of course the quattro awd one of my favorite things to do you146re never too old to be immature was to outdrag someone at a stoplight on wet pavement i could pretty well mash the pedal to the floor coming out and the car would just go leaving the other guy spinning his front or rear wheels even with traction control on a rwd or fwd you146re not going to beat awd in slippery conditions interior 150 audi is known for interior design and the a4 did have very nice styling and controls layout the bmw is not as well coordinated but is a bit more businesslike in its appearance however i like my particular color combination better than the a4146s the sand leatherette along with black floormats and dash set off by the premium wood trim makes for a nice look as opposed to the a4 that was all gray with some silver trim pieces the leatherette in the bmw is also a bit nicerappearing than the a4146s the automatic climate control on the bmw is not quite as good at regulating temperature and air movement as the audi146s the fan seems to blow too high in some conditions and not fast enough in others the audi definitely had the best autotemp control that i have experienced exterior 150 at the time that i picked out my a4 it was the e36 that i compared it against and i thought the a4 was better looking but ever since the e46 came out the next year my eye was always drawn to them when i spied one i still think though that the a4 has classic good looks that i prefer to the newer model that was released in 14601 likewise i expect that i will still prefer the e46 after the e90 comes out radio 150 no contest here the audi had a much superior standard radio on a few occasions i146ve wondered if the cds that i146m playing in the bmw are the same ones that i used to play in the a4 intangibles 150 i am not a status seeker but from the reaction of many people that i know i can see that the bmw nameplate carries a lot more prestige than most others everyone knows what a bmw is whereas i think that audi is less known and tends to get lumped with other secondtier european cars there is something about seeing that roundel on the steering wheel that makes me feel extra good about my choice sumup 150 the 325i feels like a small performance sedan with luxury appointments and options the a4 is more of a small luxury sedan that performs well and there you have it my opinion of course does the engine use in this car is designed by gm or is it a join design from gm and toyota\\ni know toyota have the vvt technology and this car use a 36l vvt engine which make me wonder did i bought a gm design or a toyota design i mean the engine use in the cadillac cts does it design by gm or by totoya its a gm engine if a slightly unusual onea large ohc job its a world engine and is supposedly going to power the saabs soon bumped down to 28l and turbocharged saab 93 earns double best pick four of eight midsize cars earned good ratings in side impact crash tests recently conducted by the insurance institute for highway safety none of the cars received a poor rating the 2004 saab 93 2004 acura tl 2004 lexus es 330 and 2005 mitsubishi galant are rated good for side impact protection the 2004 saab 95 2005 mercedes c class and 2005 volvo s40 earned acceptable ratings the 2004 jaguar xtype is rated marginal the better performers among vehicles that earn good ratings are designated best picks the saab 93 which also earned a best pick designation in the institutes frontal offset crash test is the first car to earn this designation in both front and side crash tests its a double best pick earning a double best pick is a rare achievement says institute chief operating officer adrian lund the only other vehicle to have done this is the toyota rav4 a small suv and then only when it was equipped with optional side airbags first off hats off to lexus for such a high class event and willingness to set up their 9 cars and 2 competitors in each category for the public to drive on a closed course i went saturday morning to fedex fields redskin stadium parking lot there was a quick registration orientation lexus autoshow display cooking demo kids corner a great buffet lunch and golf pros to work with your swing but the main event was driving on three different courses luxury performance and suv i drove 10 of 27 different cars in 3 hours all were automatics traction control was required to remain engaged and the rule was do not exceed the cars or your ability my notes on the cars of interest to this forum lexus is300 underpowered six compared to the bmw and g35 with a transmission that had longer shift delays competent handling and decent brakes but tended to understeer at the limit leading me to plow one hard corner racy interior with easy to use controls a good value choice if price and reliability are your top concerns in this segment the car for my younger brother infiniti g35 power oh baby this one has an engine the interior was not as bad to drive as others would lead you to believe but the handling is beneath the balance of the bmw and the lexus this is a car that makes the average driver me look bad saved by abs and the traction control system from a potentially scary rear end spin g35 owners have a reasonably priced familysized car with v8like power but you can only put it down on the track if you really know what you are doing the car for a coworker who drag races on the weekends and takes four to lunch during the week acura tl if i were picking a car for my wife sister real estate agent etc this would be the one beautiful jewellike interior with stateoftheart sound and all the features at a decent price plenty of power for the street it just doesnt handle like a sport sedan with front wheel drive mercedes c320 softer ride lesspowerful engine smooth transmission nice interior others do different parts better at lower price points nice car but nothing special for the money pass if you got the bucks and want the star think amg bmw 330i ok im biased but this car makes the average driver look good with an ideal balance of engine transmission handling and braking in a driveroriented interior drove a premium packaged car with steptronic moving the shifter inboard to sport and touching the dsc once i didnt turn it off iaw the rules and the car performs powerful acceleration outmatched only by the g35 quick redline shifts that were the best great brakes and incredibly balanced handling i was foot to the floor threshold braking hands spinnning the wheel and having the time of my life much faster car for me because of the control available the standard 330i is under tired get the sport package for the performance tires sport seats and steering wheel the steptronic evaluated in s mode was much better than i expected give me a little more power more tire and a manual  oh thats my zhp i was still amazed at what a standard 330i can do driven much harder than ive ever driven my car which i have yet to track jamesspot what were the msrps for the respective vehicles too bad they were all automatics amazes me that lexus didnt use the 325ia 325i outsells the 330i by about a factor of 3to1 325i prices out with similar options like an is300 a decently optioned 330i can quickly push 40000 did the is300 have optional lsd and vsc we just went from car to car they had info posters highlighting the specs of each of the automobiles lexus was amazingly fair in their presentation of all the cars\\nthe class groupings had the is300 with the g35 and the 330i the es330 which i didnt drive was grouped with the c320 and the tl\\nthe g35 and is300 are low 30s cars while a 330i step with premium package and the c320 are pushing 40k\\nthe is300 did have traction control i didnt know whether it had lsd or not\\ni agree  the 325i is an even match for the is300 price wise the 330i is a much more expensive and capable car\\nsince the event was for the general public invited by lexus marketing automatics were the only game in town for every car there i think i was invited as i went to the lexus web site and a dealership when i was looking at cars in the spring it did make me want to drive my car on the course i was recently at the autoshow in motion run by gm it was pretty similar in luxury cars there were all the saabs929395 the cts c320 tl 325i and the 530 i thought the tl really plowed dissapointingly much in turns even my buddy whos a huge honda fan didnt like it i think the tsx is significantly more fun otoh the tl compares quite well with the c320 the cts is allright i just think the interior needs to be upgraded and it definitely needs the sport package same with the 93 i may be biased but even my hondaloving gm mechanic buddy liked the 2 bmws the best the 530 with the sport package was simply phenomenal but thats offtopic i also had a chance to drive the s40 t5 awd i really like the design cabin and volvos environmental focus i think its a pretty good car aside from fairly significant turbo lag oddly it seems to me to have more lag with its 25l than saabs almostaspowerful 20l it also still feels like a fwd car even with awd so pretty nice but not quite as sporty as i like i like that you can get a high end car without leather and wood neither of which i really care for i think ill end up waiting to test the new 3series before i order anything and by then saab will have the 270hp turbo v6 well driving different cars is fun dave quotei mean the engine use in the cadillac cts does it design by gm or by totoya unquote the 36 l engine used in the cts is pure gm designed and built its a great engine too with plenty of hp and torque nice and smooth running too gm is planning on using that same basic engine in lots of variations of size and power as premium engines in their up market cars i owned an 04 cts with that engine and never had anything but good feelings about it there were other aspects of my cadillac buying experience that were far less satisfactory but the engine and 5 speed auto transmision were world class i own an 04 tl with 6 speed but have driven the tsx auto only my thought is that the tl is a japanese implementation of an american concept whereas the tsx is a japanese implementation of a european concept the tsx is great fun to drive but the tl has deep down power is seriously fast and is as relaxing on a long drive as a large volvo albeit not quite as comfortable a couple of hundred miles passes with ease which despite their many supposed faults is true of larger american vehicles the tsx is more alive in your hands less relaxed ultimately not as fast the tls clutch is fierce but the shift is nice once you get used to it drive something else for a while and i guarantee youll engage 1st with a bang when you next drive the tl the tls bridgestones aquaplane too easily  makes me wish for my gtis excellent continentals october sales acura tl 6717\\nlexus es300

add to the above post that bmw reports best october ever as far as the 3 series 8714 in total were sold heres the link to the information httpwwwprnewswirecomcgibinstoriesplacct109story  wwwstory110320040002353664edate almost every luxury brand is reporting best ever salesinfiniti acura lexus and bmw we like our luxury cars and suvs i guess including nissan infiniti honda acura toyota lexus hyundai volvo and bmw suprisingly neither audi nor mercedes had record october sales my bmw 3 series figures above are accurate for sedan sales this being a sedan board i left out that infiniti sold 2258 g35 coupes while bmw sold 1105 3series coupes the rest of bmw nonsedan sales were m3s wagons and convertibles perhaps my presentation was not biased enough for your strong bmw affliation kd enjoy cybersol not that its especially relevant to this discussion but how did the lincoln ls do in october several of us bought literally into the ls concept when it was first introduced had lincoln done everything they said they were going to do much like cadillac actually did two years later the ls would belong here well they didnt and it doesnt and 99 of the people driving an ls and 95 of the dealer staff havent a clue regarding the weight balance suspension vented rear brakes or all the rest oh well   anyway tia an edmundscom reporter wants your opinion 147what are the coolest cars for soccer moms148 please email jhelperinedmundscom with which vehicles you like and why please respond by this monday 118 with 147soccer moms148 in the subject line hey cyber not a matter of biased but bmw themselves lumps a number of different configurations under 3series i would think if you are telling a story the whole story needs to be told having said that the different g35 configurations coupes sedans xs should be included etc combining marque salesoctober sales acura tltsx 8587\\nlexus es330is300 6553 bmw 3 series sedan 325i330i 5602\\nmercedesbenz cclass 4748 cadillac cts 3798\\naudi a4 3359\\ninfiniti g35 sedan 3188 having multiple platforms benefits acura and lexus sales interestingly the more luxuryoriented less driveroriented largerheavier car wins es over is and tl over tsx riez  disagree combined 3 series is 8714 see above link bmw has a number of configs under the moniker 3 series tltsx two totally separate vehicles interestingly the more luxuryoriented less driveroriented largerheavier car wins es over is and tl over tsx i too noticed that luxury seems to trump performance when it comes to total sales look at the es300 for example its sad but true that enthusiasts are a minority to the appliance drivers enjoy cybersol kd\\nthat 8714 number includes more than b3 sedans incl also coups convertibles although i am not sure whatd be the  for sedans only its arguable whether tltsx or esis should be combined comparing to 325330 tl is not the same car as tsx but 325 does not have the same engine as 330s either maybe you can compare tl with 330 and tsx with 325 but the smaller 325 actually sells a lot more than the more powerful 330 opposite to tl vs tsx or es vs is theres no easy way to really match up i hope this is resolved really soon i need to know what car sold best in september so i can go out and get one lol good old kd dont forget the wagon\\nyou still amazes me take the sales figures and divide by the number of dealers that marque has thinking a small marque like infiniti has around 175200 dealers so they are selling a good number of cars per dealer per month not so much so for a large marque like cadillac which has a lot more dealers their average dealer moves few ctss each month acura dealers are moving a ton of cars per month same for lexus and cars comprise only about half of lexus sales other half are suvs if you could have a franchise which one would you want its called attention to detail the month were discussing is october youre welcome true what you say but one can also say except for price and engine output the m3 330i and 325i can be almost i did say almost identically configured additionally each vehicle has almost the same engine and has the same vehicle chassis same leg room same cup holders same radio etc that is not true with tltsx two totally separate vehicles i know youre discussing october i am making fun of how stupid the whole discussion is its called comprehension well thats just how asian cars and euro cars are made audibmwmb all do that make the same chassislook for a model but then equip them with a wide range of engines in terms of power and config lexusacurainfinity on the other hand go by one modelone engine approach theres nothing wrong either way but they do present a matching difficulty in comparison i think people do cross shop 325330 against tsx and tl or is and es both igiban not sure i agree too much with you when you write i think people do cross shop 325330 against tsx and tl or is and es both i can see reasonably informed rational buyers comparing fwders like tl tsx the euroaccord and es to each other but find it hard to see them comparing a rwd car say a 330i or is300 to a fwd car like the es330 or tsx one drive in each will tell you how dramatically different are the two cars marques that use one platform to compete across a broad market segment or many segments usually rely on lots of options including engines and available awd the 3 series is somewhat unique in that it also includes station wagon convertible coupe and m lexus chooses to use two entirely different platforms infiniti used to until they dropped the i35 now relying on the g35 with its awd and coupe versions to compete broadly but it does cost more to develop and market two entirely different platforms esp when one the es handily outsells the other the is people cross shop anything what they cross shop has no bearing on how sales numbers are presented sure you can say acura sells more tls than bmw sells 330is but that doesnt tell any picture even the sales numbers dont say anything by the sales numbers bmw should have canned the 330i a long time ago to some people this is very important to some people that fact that macdonalds sells billions and billions is more important than the fact christys steak haus sells hundreds and hundreds sales number doesnt make people buy a car infact sales number is just a result of a popular vote just like an election you may be the new president but you may not win the popular vote mcdonalds5 timex 3\\nsteak 14 rolex 1k\\nof course burgerstimex win cheapest win tsx 26k 325i  28k  330i35k msrp\\ntl  35k\\ni try to be fair by comparing 4 door sedan only not wagon\\nit tells you a different story i can see reasonably informed rational buyers comparing fwders like tl tsx the euroaccord and es to each other but find it hard to see them comparing a rwd car say a 330i or is300 to a fwd car like the es330 or tsx one drive in each will tell you how dramatically different are the two cars i didnt realize that i am uninformed and irrational thanks for enlightening me for instance are a4 sales dwindling what was the sales of the current a4 at their peak looks like is is on its last legs tsx looks like people are just paying more to get the tl fedlawman the driving dynamic difference between fwders and rwders is pretty obvious have you driven these cars back to back seriously on a decent test drive i had an es330 loaner a few weeks ago didnt drive anything like my is300 didnt take me 5 minutes to figure out they were entirely two different cars with two different missions when i looked at infiniti a few years ago i drove a g35 and an i35 difference between night and day of course i do realize that most buyers worry more about things like stereo systems cupholders and wood trim than they do driving dynamics my focus on this board is on performance not luxury if you reverse the importance you can readily come up with different results and as the sales demonstrate more buyers are interested in luxury over performance is just well sales  i never said it should necessarily mean anything i merely pointed out that one should compare sedans to sedans at least and between different approaches to package a models size power and powertrain etc from various makes its not easy to draw a me better than you conclusion drawing anything more from the above out of my words then you might be reading too sensitively relax as to whether people cross shop rwd cars to fwd cars i think so i am not saying everyone does that or its right or wrong either way from what i know many admittedly perhaps mass average drivers are flexible in terms of getting a fwd or rwd car esp in cal its one of the factors but often not the most important one unless climate dictates even people who buy rwd cars like many of my bimmer friends admit they dont tell much difference on their day to day driving between their bimmers and say their old hondas well maybe theyd not spend the extra to get a bimmer as they cant fully appreciate the extra capability but then they might have gotten a bimmer for reasons other than just rwd the driving dynamic difference between fwders and rwders is pretty obvious it is obvious to you and me but to 95 of the buying public including the kind of people that buy upscale cars such as acuras and bmws they dont know the difference i researched and planned our bmw purchase for over a year with many discussions with my wife etc and one month after we bought it my wife asked me if it was rwd or fwd and its her car the others are correct all of these cars get crossshopped those major differences to me and you are just minor things to the vast majority regards\\nkyfdx folks looking for a car here is the decision tree 1 should i go preowned certified with a late model audi a6 \\n2 should i go for a new entry level luxury sedan  i am trying to keep the price in the mid 30s for the new entry level i have really not narrowed it down much i have read some of the posts and heard great things about the new acura tl the infiniti gx 35 the bmw 325ix and the saab 95 i think based on the posts i have eliminated the lexus 330 and the subie i need to drive the car in the winter so i would probably go with a awd if it is available ill keep piling thru the posts but anyone who has anythoughts please let me know thanks\\ncdost1 i dont think there is a question about differences between rwd fwd and awd driving dynamics however there is a fine balance of performance and luxury specially in this car segment i think mane people do cross shop all three three of them one can say i got my is for its performance and not luxury but i dont think it would be true statement because is is a lexus and if you buying one you must care a grate deal about luxury as for me if tl was rwd i would already be driving one it does not mean i would not buy one i like g as well but driving dynamics of rwd and slightly better performance did not win over much better looking tlin my mind quality of the interior and slick mt at the end of the day i do want to enjoy rwd even if i can only do it once a month but on the other hand i think i will enjoy tl more as my every day car all i can say i wish i would have money for two cars but on the other hand i would not buy neither one if you want mt try s60rit starts at 37k and you can get good discounts on volvo s60r is way superior than any on your list the driving dynamic difference between fwders and rwders is pretty obviousi had an es330 loaner a few weeks ago didnt drive anything like my is300 really what a suprise next time try to get a mini cooper s i do realize that most buyers worry more about things like stereo systems cupholders and wood trim than they do driving dynamics but youre more enlightened than all of them arent you your lexus has a limitedslip my focus on this board is on performance not luxury i can and do hustle my tsx around a race track as quickly and adeptly as any nonpro driving a 325i or is300 they qualify as performanceminded enthusiasts yet because i chose a fwd sport sedan i am relegated to wood trim seeking poseur status whos uninformed and irrational these are just my 2 cents why i picked my c230k sedan 2 days ago\\n1 love the 2005 style amg style kit standard 17 rims and the big oval exhaust\\n2 rwd\\n3 too many 325i on the road and the 2006 3series will be out sometime next year dont want to drive an old car in a couple months\\n4 dealer offered 4000 off msrp that makes it around 30k w auto sunroof xenon and cd changer\\n5 i can see the little star on the hood when i am driving people are getting realistic nowadays\\n6 its somewhat underpowered but i am ok w that coz i dont top my car more than 5 of the time 7 its well balanced in terms of pricing comfort and performance about the 04 325i my close friend got one and i have borrowed it over a weekend engine is smooth steering is responsive hers doesnt have sport pkg another friend got a 03 is300 torque is great gear is long especially 1st and 2nd gear fun to drive but not worth the 33k i paid my 05 c230k sedan for under 30k audi 18t quattro some turbo lag great style price bumped up a lot with all that options if you are considering the audi wait till next years 20l direct injection engine that had 200horses and faster response only spend about 3 miles in the tl its fast some torque steering interior is great comfortable tons of standard features but it depreciates more than a bmw and mbz and its still a japanese car if they make it rwd it will replace my mbz in my garage i think if acura make the tl rwd it will cost at least 3000 more fedlawman ill take fwd seriously when f1 champ irl nascar etc have fwders competing and winning of course you had the knowledge to bring up the mini cooper s almost a dedicated track gocart the mini is very specialty model but the underpowered base model isnt anything to write home about in europe there are even a mini one and i believe a diesel the tsx euroaccord is a nice car reasonably priced excellent value great size but to be serious you have to have the 6speed manual in order to wring the most out of the highreving enging id love to know what percentage of tsxs sold in usa are coming with the automatic i couldnt imagine driving a 4cyl auto tsx hondaacura has indicated that the shawd system presently found in the new 2005 rl will become a distinguishing characteristic of the acura brand obviously the 2006 tl would be a great candidate for that john pretty fair review one quibble the tl has higher residual values than the c230 or the 325 still a japanese car im not sure why its this is used in a pejorative sense the reliability reputation of japanese cars is much better than european cars perhaps youre referring to the generaly looser steering of japanese cars the tl is not getting the rwd any time soon but it will probably get the shawd from the rl itll add 2000 to the price in all likelihood people cross shop anything what they cross shop has no bearing on how sales numbers are presented                      bingo           some may spend months researching bimmers or benzs and in the final minutes go home in a tl or a 300c they might like the name mercedes but perhaps they leave in a audi  it depends on a potpourri of things prices their own personal taste payments the way the vehicle handles or sounds  that said most make their final decision when they actually feeltouch and drive the vehicles  its a never a perfect science                            terry i can see reasonably informed rational buyers comparing fwders like tl tsx the euroaccord and es to each other but find it hard to see them comparing a rwd car say a 330i or is300 to a fwd car like the es330 or tsx one drive in each will tell you how dramatically different are the two cars wait so someone who compares a tl to lets say a 330i is irrational lets face it the majority of people buying cars dont buy a car based on fwd or rwd but rather on which car they like better to most buyers driving dynamics dont even matter in the sense you talk about because the majority of buyers dont take offramps 80mph and basically dont drive aggressively typically safety ride comfort and features are on most buyers minds i dont think when a buyer doesnt care about their car being fwd or rwd they are being irrational and in the real car buying world buyers compare cars more in terms of price then size or what wheels are being driven by the engine  the one thing about all this rwd discussion forgets is geographics               most buyers in denver chicago and richmond probably havent forgotten that 2030 inches of snow they will be seeing  soon                                   terry 1 well how about a series thats actually based on cars that regular folks like you and i own  the speed world challenge touring car championship the tsxs driven by kleinubing and plumb won just as many races as the bmw 3series the mazda 6 protege and nissan altima are also very competitive\\nhttpwwwspeedarenacomnewspublishtouring_carsarticle_5249 shtml 2 of course when discussing fwd performance the mini immediately comes to mind still even the underpowered base model will outhandle any car in this forums segment and is a blast to drive also the volvo v40 t5 saab 93 mazda 6 and tsx all offer performance thats comparable to any car in this forums segment now ill concede that perhaps a professional driver on a closed course could extract a 10 or 20 sec advantage out of the rwd cars but not you or meespecially on public roads 3 you claim to be a performanceminded enthusiast yet when you said you have to have the 6speed manual in order to wring the most out of the highreving engine you make it sound like getting a root canal i didnt enjoy my root canal but the slick 6speed mt and sewingmachine smooth 7500 rpm rev limit is what sold me on the tsx fedlawman i prefer 6 and 8 cyl engines more useable torque esp at lower rpms the tsx would be a blast to drive hard on the track though youd be shifting a lot and running very high rpms i dont do too much of that i tend to stay in 3rd and 4th gears when playing with my car on the twisties in the real world what are the rpms for a tsx 6speed in 3rd gear at 60 mph 4th at 80 mph i do miss my old 98 540i6 great engine and transmission despite all the attempts no one yet has repealed the laws of physics for frontheavy powerful fwders ugly things like torque steer that is why acura audi and subaru use awd rroyce10 geographics can have a huge impact on sales friend of mine lives in a metro area that has about 100000 people say within 50 miles radius but that area does not have a single audi bmw mb acura infiniti or lexus dealer she is forced to consider cars like cts or ls because she doesnt want to drive 75100 miles for sales and service there really arent that many dealers for some marques eg infiniti or lexus esp when compared to cadillac or lincoln if all we care about is the average driver going about their normal routine then why dont all you luxury fwd advocates push decent cars like kia amati and hyundai xg350 just compare room ride and luxury equipment youd save a fortune compared to es330 i35 loaded tl you could buy the bigger more luxurious car for about same as the smallish 4cyl acura tsx euroaccord id love to hear why the es330 is so much better car than the xg or amati ive put 60000 nearly troublefree miles on my 00 hyundai sonata gls v6 5speed manual tcabs leather sunroof etc id take that for 20000 over an es330 for 35000 any day well how about a series thats actually based on cars that regular folks like you and i own  the  the tsxs driven by kleinubing and plumb won just as many races as the bmw 3series as has been pointed out here numerous times the cars are specifically handicapped to make the races compeitive you win a few races you are given ballast scca rules are designed to produce competitve races not discover which car is faster httpwwwspeedvisionwccommedia200404sebpkitpdf  page 7  why do you keep ignoring this fact dave you are comparing a es330 tl i35 to xg350s and amantis do you forget about something called luxury safety  features lets not forget the biggest advantage to the luxury cars as compared to the hyundais and kiasquality id love to hear why the es330 is so much better car than the xg or amati huh the es330 doesnt have chevy corsica rear ends from like a decade and a half ago\\nthe es330 has more features hids vsc side curtain airbags mark levinson stereo rear sunshade auto dimming mirrors memory seats dual front power windows\\nthe es330 is safer hey its got one of the best safety ratings around\\nits higher qualitymuch better leather real wood quieter better fit  finish\\nits got prestige who wants to ride around in a kia or hyundai im sure even most buyers of those cars would rather be in something else\\ndealer service then why dont all you luxury fwd advocates push decent cars like kia amati and hyundai xg350 simple the kia and hyundai arent luxury fwd cars i always get a kick out of people who say a real performance car cannot have fwd unless you are taking your car to the track nobody can realistically get significant benefits from a rwd car vs fwd and even then its questionable i think the whole thing is for bragging rights kinda like the whole horsepower war that is going on right now how many people are going to use more than 250 hp to merit the additional 25 cost that a 300 hp v8 allows in fact i just got back from the lexus event in houston i test drove about 15 cars on the test track i thought the fwd drive acura tl handled vastly better on the course than the mercedes 320 and the lexus gs 300 i could feel the difference in the spring rates very soft on the 320 and 300 but as far as fwd vs rwd i did not experience any significant understeer on the acura vs others riez  i prefer 6 and 8 cyl engines more useable torque esp at lower rpms i say toemaytoe and you say toematoe dhanley  the cars are specifically handicapped to make the races compeitive you win a few races you are given ballast im not ignoring this fact i just think its irrelevant given that the rewards system applies to all competitors it doesnt change the fact that in this series the rwd cars dont seem to hold an advantage over the fwd cars and thats my whole point when i was shopping for a car last year i had 330i 325i s60 es330 g35 gs tl and tsx on my list i almost ended up with the 330325 or tsx and actually already began negotiating it i didnt know why the is300 never came across my mind since none of my friends had ever mentioned it a 4 cylinder car is more than enough for a smallmedium size sedan nowadays 6 isnt a plus or minus it lowers your gas mileage and raise the maintainance fee a bit if you look at tsx gas mileage its very impressive 2231 vs 1824 unless the 6 produces 50 more of hptorque but again you wont be needing them in the real world i dont choose a car based on how many cylinder it has but on many other things has anybody ever complained driving an es330 bcuz its a fwd why es sells more than is a rwder its more expensive and a fwder well i think you know the answer maxhonda99 methinks youve completely forgotten that the lexus es330 is a gussied up toyota camry the camry is not the be all or end all of automotive excellence you should check out the standard safety and luxury equipment on both the xg350 and amati and look at the price forgive me if im wrong but the last time i looked at the es330 standard equipment list tons of things were optional is leather now standard used to be optional that mark levinson stereo standard have you driven either the quality of my 00 sonata has been better than either of the two bmws i used to own or my old lincoln ls noticed your first point was one of style another point is prestige noticed no mention of performance or driving fun appears you are more worried about being seen in the right car than driving the right car i dont care what others think about the cars i buy and drive i buy and drive them for me for my driving pleasure noticed your first point was one of style another point is prestige noticed no mention of performance or driving fun appears you are more worried about being seen in the right car than driving the right car i dont care what others think about the cars i buy and drive i buy and drive them for me for my driving pleasure \\namen the badge is meaningless i dont know if you spend any time in any of the two carses330 and xg350 but they from two different worlds es is a luxury car and xg is just working its way up camry has better leather than gx as for fwr vs rwd if i remember correctly you drive 200hp is300 i dont think any modern fwd car with 200hp has any torque steer tsx is very close if not better on the track than is i think it is pretty hard to argue against the assertion that the typical 325i or tl buyer is not concerned in the least about the difference between fwd and rwd handling dynamics and i bet that typical covers at least 90 of those purchasing either car full disclosure liked the 325i legacy gt the tsx and the cts didnt care for the tl s40 passat or the g35 your mileage will of course vary criteria was funtodrivefour doorsmanual transmission john did someone say the camry is the be all end all of automotive excellence did someone say the same about the lexus es i dont think so oh yeah the amanti and xg350 have excellent low prices and great feature content but guess what to get the great feature content at a great price something has to give sure hyundais quality has improved greatly but it aint up to toyota standards hyundai may be making strides in the iqs study but tell me when it gets there in long term dependability and it consistently ranks at the top i have driven a 03 possibly es300 loaner about a year ago and i have driven the xg350not sonata sorry but the xg350 is not comparable in anyway to the es not in terms of feature quality ride performance fit  finish nothing nadda the leather in the xg350 is low quality the plastics are cheap the overall interior feel is cheap although it is a lot better than hyundais from just 5 years ago performance or driving fun whats your point neither car is about driving fun so do i need to mention it i will say the es300 was a better driver than the xg350 the xg350 was ridiculous softly sprung almost like a town car appears you are more worried about being seen in the right car than driving the right car funny i dont own a lexus also as you can see i said most buyers how does that translate to me its funny how the es330 is always at or near the top of just about every quality category as well as safety and resale value yet you are trying to lower it to the class of a hyundai maxhonda99 im no automotive snob i currently own a lexus and a hyundai i love them both my first brand new car way back when was a geo suzuki ive owned buick ford vw chevy x3 chrysler suzuki x2 mercury bmw x2 lincoln infiniti x2 hyundai and lexus x2 for the money id much rather have to pay for an xg than an es the es330 does nothing for me from a driving standpoint nor does xg es was just plain dull and isolating but then luxury isnt near the top of my list of desired attributes pg48477 torque steer isnt only tied to hp the small displacement 4cyl in the tsx has little torque esp down low and has to be wrapped to very high rpms in order to generate hp fwders can reduce torque steer using lsd equallength halfshafts and good tires thanks much i will definitely try the s60r hi jrock65 thank you for your response data i got from other forum\\n05 c230k sport sedan 36month 12kyr residual 60\\n04 325i 36month 12kyr residual 61\\n05 tl 36month 12yr residual 58 when we lease car the residual is calculated based on the msrp for bmw its already a good deal if u can get 500 over invoice for tl its hard to even knock off 500 from the msrp however i am getting close to 4000 off msrp for the mbz in conclusion the larger the gap between the msrp and the selling price the less depreciation you will have to pay\\nassume that the residual are the same ive done some research when i lease my c230k i can get 399 plus tax 0 down on a c230k w msrp of 34000 while i have to pay around 20 more 0 down per month for a tl w msrp of around 32900 not to mention that the mbcc charge more on the interest its a given that the reliability of german car is always a  thats why i lease the mbz so that i dont need to worry about reliability issue and i did have 4 toyotas before still having a 03 4runner and i have to admit that japanese cars are problem free i am sorry but i shouldnt have made the still a japanese car comment yes you can feel it when u r sitting inside a mbz or bmw or even a vw did own a 1999 vw golf before may be its my personal bias shawd will be an awesome car and its well worth the extra 2k a 270hp fwd just doesnt sound right to me but i think it would be great if you can get it at msrp when it first came out httpwwwcarscomcarsappnationalsrvleaseactrvmk nmacuramdnmtlyr2004x2y17 according to the american leasing guide tl is 52 at 36 months 325i is 51 and c230 is 46 in any case the differences are minor and all three hold value well im surprised that you could only get 500 off a tl maybe its bc the 2005 just came out in a couple months they should be close to invoice i know what youre talking about with the germanjapan distinction although personally i prefer the feel of japanese cars in general the leathers in german cars are firmer japanese leathers are softer and german steering is heavier and japanese steering is lighter in any case the mb is a fine car and hope you enjoy it im surprised that you could only get 500 off a tl maybe its bc the 2005 just came out in a couple months they should be close to invoice how did you get the idea that tld be at invoice price in a few months 04 tl never got to that point the whole year what made you think 05 will get there suddenly how did you get the idea that tld be at invoice price in a few months 04 tl never got to that point the whole year what made you think 05 will get there suddenly bc in my area dc you could get a base auto 2004 tl for 500 to 800 over invoice about 5 months ago the navis were much harder to discount got you well thats more close to the end of 04 model but even then its not at invoice yet maybe when 06 comes out it will be i think 05 has more nav tl made now still a 2500 or so premium over nonnav is expected in most metropolitan areas traffic keeps getting worse so performance driving just isnt that possible on urban and suburban streets but definitely having a performance car lends it cachet even in crowded rushhour traffic especialy if the car looks muscular 147but definitely having a performance car lends it cachet\\x85148 heaven help us now we146ll have to listen to lectures from blueguy and riez for the next week just kiddin146 dudes\\x85 looove you guys personally i choose my cars based on how chicks with multiple body piercings like them  the key in every purchase for me is one question will a 19 year old sdsu student from a raisin farm in fresno think this is cool if the purchase doesnt meet that criteria its not getting made if ya believe that ive got a seaside san diego home to sell you for 100k you cant underestimate the py magnet factor btw the new bmw 3series will be in gran turismo 4 for the playstation 2 people can see the cars in the game well before theyre available for sale in the us thank you jrock65 for the valuable information from the information i can tell why most people would lease a bmw or a mbz because both company are offering programs to support customers in leasing i am glad that mbz offered me 60 residual on my 39months lease term if ive bought the car and sell it in 3 years i will get a bigger hit ive never heard of any acura going close to invoice you must have good negotiation skills to do that good job i can see why the 325i is so much more popular over the 330i a wellequipped 325i is 36000 while the 330i equipped in the exact same way is 42000 thats an increase of 6000 for some more horses the 325i does feel quite underpowered though for more horses at that price point and similar features i guess you could go with the 35000 g35 by the time you put everything on the 325i that comes standard on the 330i the difference is more like 4000 but still substantial if you can live without some of the extras of course the difference is 6k a new 05 325i with no options has an msrp of 30k jrock  kyfdx it was for those reasons i went with an lexus is300 5speed manual cost less than a similarly equipped 325i is has better standard equipment plus better warranty and had some other features i wanted which you cant get on a 325i or 330i eg lsd the 325i is rather expensive for what you get cant argue with that but almost any new bmw is expensive for what you get that is included kind of like a mandatory option i like the is300 and almost bought one but i decided to get a slightly used 3series instead since my wife drives it it really wouldnt have mattered that much but when the blue moon comes around and i get to drive im glad i did anyone seriously considering a car in this segment cannot make a fully informed decision without at least testdriving the 325i first its the benchmark  the 5050 sportluxury mix i believe that to purchase another car in this segment is300 g35 etc is to basically choose something that is 6040 3575 etc as compared to the 325i btw i saw the 05 g35 at the auto show last weekend and its the one id choose if was shopping this segment today with 298 hp 6speed mt and nicelyupdated interior quality how can any other 30000ish car compete as for the price difference between the 325i and 330i i think the 325i is the better choice you can order it with fewer options and if you dont think its quick enough you can add a conforti chip and cai for a few hundred dollars and make it perform within a hair of a 330i brian\\nstill searching for that perfect 89 325is im waffling 91 318is is way up there but my tenyearold just loves the 318ti i personally think it is kind of homely but looks rank very low on my list on bmwusacom i equipped the cars in the following way using the base tl as the features benchmark 325i metallic paint premium package auto heated seats xenon premium sound 35920 330i metallic paint premium package auto transmission heated seats xenon 41545 difference of about 5600 equipped in that way what does the 330i have over the 325i other than horses and different rims maybe im missing something leather in the 330i included in premium package still 1450 extra in the 325i that is the first thing that pops up but that knocks it down to about 4k i might have missed something small other than that but that is the main thing edit also if you add the sport package price gets closer by a few more hundred as the sport suspension is standard in the 330i good catch thought leather was part of the premium package for the 325i if you include leather the 325i price becomes 37370 about 4000 less than the 330i as you pointed out yeah i only obsessed about buying one for over a year you wouldnt believe the crap that is floating around in my head even a year later i cant let it go that is why i am still herelol another thing that comes to mind is that the 330i has a larger more substantial transmission at least in three pedal form and larger more substantial brakes best regards\\nshipo yeah yeah and the aerokit on the sport package and those cool m68 wheels wsport pkg 225 hp that is mostly what you are paying 4k for it makes a big difference but if you dont have the money you can live without it it is a great car either way regards\\nkyfdx finally saw a 530i sport with those type 42 wheels i am really glad they wont fit my car amazing yeah the 318is is a terrific lightweight tossable sedan it just doesnt have the performance potential of a lightly modded chip ihe 25l the ti is ugly enough to me to be a dealbreaker i own a 2004 tl and test drove a 2005 g35x i would like to give my opinions of the two cars the new g is a rocket blows the doors off the tl at low end accel the g is i believe a little nicer inside with more creature comforts in the premium package tilt and telescoping steering electric is very nice to have the ease of use of the nonkey is great the wood trim is interesting inside i am a huge wood guy but this wood is not as shiny or good looking as others looks cheap i hope m does better    on the tl we are missing a few creature comforts like the electric steering wheel and automatic lights the tl looks in my opinion nicer on the outside the tl has again in my opinion the worthless voice activation system which gets the request right about 50 percent of time all in all these 2 cars are very close the awd of the g would probably make me buy it if i was in the market at this time price however will certainly be higher on the g                      bill btw i saw the 05 g35 at the auto show last weekend and its the one id choose if was shopping this segment today with 298 hp 6speed mt and nicelyupdated interior quality did they fix the overly firm leather seats as well i heard they upgraded the interior materials as well though im guessing not by much is there much discounting on either of the 3 series these days or are people even paying over msrp how likely is it to get the car exactly configured as you want or like other imports do people tend to end up with whatever is on hand and what kind of deal they can get on it hi all my a4 just got totalled so now im scrambling to find a replacement car ive pretty much narrowed down to the g35 and tl id personally love a g35 coupe 6speed that would be too perfect but this car also has to be my commuter and i drive  75 milesday also i live around dc so i cant get by for a couple weeks with rwd only so this makes the tl my first choice trust me id love to have awd or even rwd but its just not really a suitable choice fwd does have its drawbacks but i think itll serve my purposes well im going to go ahead and check out the 2005 g35 toothey supposedly improved the leather among other things otherwise i cant really think of any other choices at this point and the wife said i can have a 6speed if i get the tl sounds fair you might want to take a glance at the bmw 3series prices paid  buying experience board to see what kind of discounts are currently available i believe 1k  15k off msrp is reasonable as for configuration you can order your car exactly as you want it when i was looking for my car i couldnt find what i wanted so i ordered mine the order process was very easy it took 7 weeks from order to delivery also i live around dc so i cant get by for a couple weeks with rwd only ummm why not i live in new hampshire and drive a 530i all winter in fact its snowing right now  and im about to head out to run some errands i simply invested 1000 in a set of winter wheels shod with michelin arctic alpin tires and even though we had just shy of ten feet of snow two winters ago my car did not miss a single day of driving and easily a match for any fwd or even awd car that didnt have winter tires on it too yeah i know that its kind of a pain to have to swap rubber twice a year but that way you dont have to compromise on the car that you want to drive best regards\\nshipo having owned an m3 rip and 325 through two dc and a handful of utah winters i will whole heatedly agree with shipo not once has the 325 all seasons w lsd let me down and only once have i not been able to get where i wanted to go in the m3 and that was my fault  car was wearing zrated tires at the time if fwd makes you feel more comfortable then dont let us stop you but dismissing a modern traction controlled lsd equipped rwd vehicle because of some snow in february is hooey i understand that tires make a large difference in performance during snowy times my main concern is just the sheer distance i have to drive in the snow im still under the impression that rwd even with snow tires and traction control is still not good on snow my neighbors all have 325is g35s m3s and eclasses the majority have advised not driving on snow in rwd even with snowsmostly because they couldnt make it up the hill to get out of my hood its a big one oh well ill make the wife stay home and just take the 4runner yeeee ha nightmare  any car with summer tires  snow im not sure what you mean by sheer distance but i dont think distance has any relevance to the discussion i have over 20 years of fwd driving under my belt in addition to my 15 years of rwd driving most of it in snow country and of our current three cars 2fwd  1rwd ill choose the bmw over the other two when it comes to any trip in the snow short or long in my case i live 40 miles or so north of boston however i have clients down in the nyc area and make the trip at least once a month some months are more like 4 trips and unless i have some specific reason like taking the kids who like to watch movies while on long trips itll be the 530i every time fwiw i used to be a fwdawd bigot that is until i put winter tires on my car in 2002 prior to that i was convinced that rwd simply required too much work to drive safely in the slippery stuff when i did finally break down and get the winter tires i was simply astounded at the difference that car is now by far the easiest car to drive in the snow that i have ever driven best regards\\nshipo im not sure what you mean by sheer distance but i dont think distance has any relevance to the discussion sure it does by sheer distance i am calculating risk based on law of averages  risk and variable road conditions for example i could make it one mile up the road in my audi with zrated summer tires however i would never drive any further since odds dictate that my minimal traction would eventually cause me to lose control and crash anyways im way off topic now just glad to hear rwd is usable in snow since im currently an awdfwd bigot now that you mention that i might be heading to the infiniti dealer to get a nice g35 coupe 6speed that car is amazing just have to convice the wife that the g35c is better than the tl thatll be harder than driving uphill with rwd and summer tires just have to convice the wife that the g35c is better than the tl thatll be harder than driving uphill with rwd and summer tires yikes been there done that got the tee shirt in my experience a car with rwd and summer performance tires becomes practically undrivable with something like 00001 of snow on the road if there is anything more than a 5 degree incline oh well enjoy your tl  best regards\\nshipo i didnt notice any problem with the seats though i only sat in it for a few minutes several people have complained about the seats being uncomfortable on the drivers right side due to the seat controls being on top of the seat edge on long drives this apparently can make your right thigh sore does anybody know if this problem has been corrected in the 2005 g 35 sedan had no problem on unsalted hilly wisconsin roads rwd  snows   fwd  awd   all_seasons no matter what you drive awd 4wd fwd rwd your car will benefit from using dedicated snow tires one reason the more drivingserious europeans drive about 75 summerwinter tires vs only 25 allseason tires percentages reversed in usa is fascinating that so many americans will spend 3050k on a sport sedan but then drive on mediocre allseason tires all that separates you and the road is a small contact patch of rubber buy the best tires that means dedicated summer really 3season tires and dedicated winter tires key to safe winter driving is driving skill traction is reduced modify your driving habits select the right gear apply the throttle differently take things slower nothing used to bring a bigger smile to my face more in winter than driving my rwd 97 camaro with snow tires and seeing all the suvs in the ditch during a snow storm because their foolish driver thought they were invulnerable to winter conditions they would barrel past me on interstate at 70 mph while im doing 55 mph then down road i pass em while they dig out of a snow bank what do you guys do keep a set of wheels with summer and winter tires then have them swapped out between season man im glad i live in ca yes i have a set of inexpensive winter wheels borbet type e with a set of michelin arctic alpin tires mounted on them i put them on in november and usually take them off in march or april man im glad i live in ca hmmm the cost of my winter set is less than a fifth of the extra taxes that id be paying per year if i lived in california that and my 1500 square foot basement has lots of space to store a set if tires man im glad i live in new hampshire  best regards\\nshipo last weekend i put a set of bridgestone blizzak ws50 20555r16 91q tires on my wifes is300 sportcross wagon bought em thru the tire rack part of their is300 package 800 for tires 105t  alloy wheels 95w plus 7740 for freight and then a final 20 at installation grand total of 89940 had the four tireswheels shipped directly to one of the participating tire rack installers in omaha ne to haas very easy to order no problems with installation worked like a charm im going to put on a set of snow tires for my 04 is300 sedan im still deciding looking at dunlop snow sport m3s or michelin arctic alpin ill likely make my mind up this week dont forget that taller narrower winter tires work best so for me that means going from 17 inch to 16 inch tires i really like the arctic alpin tires lots of grip in the slippery stuff quiet on dry pavement that said given their 100 mph limit im probably inclined to spend an extra 20 or so per tire next time and buy something like the michelin pilot alpin pa2 tires yeah yeah i know i live in new england and cannot really use a tire with a higher speed rating all that often that said last winter on one of my trips to nyc i was on the mass pike tooling along with a group of about 6 cars at about 100 when another group of about 10 cars caught us and passed us the cars in my group accelerated and joined the larger group that is except me  best regards\\nshipo hmmm the cost of my winter set is less than a fifth of the extra taxes that id be paying per year if i lived in california that and my 1500 square foot basement has lots of space to store a set if tires man im glad i live in new hampshire  lol you got me on that one shipo of course im originally from nh so i may find that a little more amusing than most people also my wife is from ca  hence why i have to buy her an awd car xi and equip it with blizzaks\\ni have read previously that a rwd car is easier to drive up a hill than a fwd car equipped with comparable tires due to the weight shift to the rear\\nyou may want to consider that in your decision oddly enough my wife is from california as well this whole winter thing is still a little new to her even after living in the nyc metro area for over a dozen years and now our third winter in nh me i originally hail from michigan although i too lived in ca for several years in the end i had to move back up north i missed winter too much and weekend visits up to mammoth just didnt give me enough of a fix  regarding up hill in a rwd car yes i believe that depending upon the situation it is easier assuming you can maintain enough momentum to keep the front wheels rolling fast enough to allow you enough steerage to correct for the resultant fishtailing yikes what a sentence my mom was an english teacher  that said of all the cars that ive ever owned my hill climbing champ was indeed a car setup in the fwd configuration my 1982 audi 4000 talk about lowtech fwd how on earth could that have been my best climber simple in reverse  i was on my way to an assignation which included an almost empty rental ski condo a hot fire and good food and wine up in boyne city mi and all that stood between me and valhalla was a very steep slippery snow and ice covered dirt road after several attempts to climb the hill nose first i sat at the bottom for a few minutes and thought about the situation logically i popped it in reverse and climbed that hill with absolutely no problem when i pulled up in front of the condo she came out and asked how in the hell did you get your car up here i needed to park in town and bum a ride from somebody with a jeep i dont think i ever actually confessed to her that i did it in reverse  best regards\\nshipo hmm have you considered g35x its got awd for sure\\nand no belive me you dont want summer tires in heavy snow it almost got me killed once though i dont know how much it snows in dc but it cant be worse than minneapolis right as sonny elliot sp the old weatherman from detroit used to say the folks in the dc area get lots of frizzle freezing rain and drizzle slice slush that then freezes to ice and slow sleet and snow mixture speaking stictly for myself id rather drive in a good old fashioned minneapolis snow storm anyday compared to a dc slow storm  best regards\\nshipo alright i have to throw in two cents to keep this place honest i used to live in 10000 feet up in the colorado rockies at first i was intimidated by the thought of snow storms and compromises with mobility then i quickly realized that the snow crews are nothing like nyc areas where you sometimes have to wait a day to have roads cleared in dem dere mountains snow barely had a chance to touch the ground before they would clear the roads the more populated areas anyway my brother lived in montreal and it146s pretty much the same way so it seems to me that one146s daily conditions play a role when considering winter driving equipment if you can whisk your way onto clear roads and highway the risk of getting marooned is considerably lower i often find myself on lots of hills with plenty of deep stuff andor ice i know a thing or two about getting by with two wheels but nothing beats awd in snow151nothing never even came close to having a snag you have to use more skill and savvy with the others like taking circuitous routes home maintaining momentum into a hill or driving uphill backwards not many people would think of these things i agree that allseason tires are not the way to go with rwd and fwd they have mostly summertire characteristics and i would only use them with awd even then they compromise traction braking and handling in snow bottom line here driving in snow with rwd and fwd is like jogging with florsheim wingtips sure you can do it but a g35x 325xi or anything else like this is a great choice shipo your mom should be proud of you151i see nothing wrong with that sentence i would imagine however that she wouldn146t approve of your 100 mph jaunts  you ca people must me totally bored with this stuff question\\x85does santa claus go to places like san diego indeed i envy you i have them on my wifes car the handling is incredible im sure you give up some snow traction to a qrated tire but she never came close to getting stuck last year if we drove in heavy snow frequently i might have a different opinion but i recommend the vrated enthusiastically we have goodyears regards\\nkyfdx traction\\n \\n1 awd wallseasons\\n2 fwd wwinter tires\\n3 rwd wwinter tires\\n4 fwd wallseasons\\n5 rwd wallseasons handlingstopping any car with winter tires over any other car even awd with allseasons no twowheel drive car has the traction of an awd even with winter tires but if you want to do it all regards\\nkyfdx hmmm i gotta disagree with you about some if this i regularly drive two fwd cars and one rwd car shod with winter tires and i think that there is little comparison the rwd car seems to have significantly better traction in all driving regimens so based upon that i would suggest a slight change to your chart for traction i assume we are only talking about acceleration here 1 awd wwinter tires\\n2 awd wallseason tires\\n3 rwd wwinter tires\\n4 fwd wwinter tires\\n5 fwd wallseason tires\\n6 rwd wallseason tires  im not completely convinced that the awd car with allseasons would be of any advantage over the rwd car with winter tires then again there are the issues of handling and braking and if i remember the results of the sidebyside test performed by an auto magazine several years ago using cars as nearly matched as possible mb e320 4matic mb e320 rwd audi a6 quattro audi a6 fwd the results shifted more in favor of the winter tire shod rwd car in fact if im not mistaken in the braking department the rwd car easily won due to its inherently more neutral frontrear weight distribution especially compared to the fwd a6 combined with its relatively lighter weight compared to the two awd cars personally i am willing to give up some go power to gain some stop power hence my comment that i believe that a rwd car especially one with a near neutral weight distribution shod with winter tires offers the best driving experience for winter driving that said if i lived in a mountainous area such as the rockies i would certainly opt for the awd car simply because on a steep enough hill the fwdrwd car simply aint gonna start moving from a standing stop while the awd car will move away from the stop with relative aplomb  best regards\\nshipo why do you have 5  6 flipflopped in comparison to 3  4 is this what the magazine test indicated it seems to suggest this in your manner of reference but its not quite clear and at the same time curious i never really expected this would stray so far off topic but i guess you can expect this discussion this time of year anyways i now believe it is possible to drive uphill on snow in summer tires because the wife actually likes the g35 family not so much the sedan its looks arent the best imo but the coupe i will admit that driving a rwd coupesedan is just a completely different experience from a fwd in this case different is much better the handling acceleration and braking are all a world better i am aware of the g35x but i was really hoping to get the 6speed of course the wife wandered over to the fx35 and i knew it was all over fortunately this is my car so theres a chance that i will win this battle the dealer had some 05 g35xs in stock but i didnt get a chance to see one or drive one the interior is supposed to be up in quality now vs the 04s unfortunately the 6speed wont be around until late january or februaryand i need a car now since mine is totalled thanks for all the comments on winter tires and such im paying cash for the car anyways so i might as well just take 1000 and get a quality set of winter tires then i can run summerwinters and have it all geeze having your cake and eat it toosay it aint so tim i have two sets of winter tires also for both cars i dont mind the trouble of switching them and spending 1k for a set of spare wheels n winter tires well it keeps you out of trouble eventhough they still spin a little bit but not as often i have to stay with my the onlylast insurance company some accidents before and i also put some heavy stuff in the trunk so if the fwder has an engine on top of their front wheels i got my small loaded fridge on the top of my rear wheels well it works it does help traction and a happy 2035 mph on snow lol i just came back from the dealer they had 2005g35x did not get a chance to drive it but spend some time in the car i do find that seat controls are in the wrong spot but the seat is very comfortable both driver and passenger even though interior design is pretty much the same as 04 materials used are much better gages are still orange but way better looking than 04 and does not look at all like the one in altima before interior was the only thing in the way of buying a car and i was leaning more towards tl but now i think g is the one have to convince my wife to get a 6mt and the deal is done well i was trying to show there is a big difference between go power and stopturn power ive had four awds with three different awd4wd systems and everyone of them had better traction go power with allseasons than any 2wd car ive driven with winter tires including my current one and although i would rather have rwdwinters than fwdwinters for the overall handling experience stopturngo power if i am considering only traction go power i still have to go with the fwd i will grant that the type of car makes a difference though a large car with a long wheelbase loses some of the traction advantage that fwd provides by moving more of the weight off the front wheels my old 82 accord hatchback with 6364 of the weight over the front wheels would leave any rwd car spinning its wheels a new tl or es300 would have much less advantage over a 5series or gs300 regards\\nkyfdx everything ive heard so far says that the interior of the g35 is much improved for 2005but the sticky issue is that the 6speeds wont be coming out until late january or early february since my car is totalled i am in need of a car very very soon puts me in quite the pickle i dont really want to settle for an 04 but i cant think of any other choicebesides renting a car until that time ouch  i do agree the placement for the seat adjustment is wrong but the seats are quite comfortable if you are not tooo wide in the backside i suppose i could settle with the automatic 05 or even an 04 6speed but something tells me ill regret it on the other hand arent the 04s going for well under invoice now theres quite a few things i can spend 34k on vegas dealer did mention that 2005 6mt has to be ordered but he sounded like it can be done much sooner than january interesting result i expected volvo and saab among the best but i didnt expect audi  bmw among the worst httpwwwcnncom2004us1114vehicleswhiplashapindexhtml interesting considering i know someone who has the same car as me who got rearended by a truck on the turnpike car was totalled he walked out without injury no whiplash while im sure the study has a basis for the endresults in this one case i would have expected some more injury to my friend considering it was a classic textbook rearending for more horses at that price point and similar features i guess you could go with the 35000 g35 35k for a g35 who pays msrp for a g35 all my figures were just msrp not saying that anyone pays msrp for a g35 no one pays msrp for a 3 series either at least i hope not the discounting makes the g35 even a better deal since one can generally discount a g35 more off msrp than a 3 series you do get free maintenance and better gas mileage with the 3 both 30 and 25 however what is the present day worth of the free maintenance anyway the discounting makes the g35 even a better deal since one can generally discount a g35 more off msrp than a 3 series \\nuntil november there was a 3k rebate on the 330i so figuring subtract that from 400 over invoice and youre talking about over 5k off the msrp sticker on a 330i are people getting g35s for 5k off sticker if so thats awesome hello if you are in vegas as your post said i bought an 04 g35 sedan in late sept for 500 under invoice at the dealership here both are owned by the sale company and if it is of interest to you i bought my car at the sahara dealership best regards i didnt know that you could get 5000 off msrp on a 330i that is awesome historically my impression is that the 3 series was harder to discount than the g35 sedan historically nope theoretically yes\\nin reality its easier to get 330is for 5k under msrp than getting a 325i for 5k under msrp due to the fact that 325i sells a whole lot better and it holds better value when youre reselling it that nissan 35 is a beast though i rented a maxima over the weekend and though the car was a tin can that engine made the tires squeal really easy i test drove the cts with high hopes as i love the way the bigger caddies handle and like the looks of the cts i was disappointed for me it was draggy bumpy and the steeringhandling wasnt at all like the larger models just my opinion i know others love theirs but if youre looking for a caddie drive in a less expensive smaller body the cts is a nonstarter i understand they are coming out with a v8 very soon folks i am kind of stuck and could use some help i am trying to do the pros and cons of a 325xi g35x and a tl i live in the northeast so the awd would be nice but not a necessity i drove all 3 cars was leaning toward the bmw but it seems a bit underpowered vs the other 2 in the decision set am i making a mountain out of a mole hill or is should this be a concern also i heard from some folks that the tl tends to develop some rattles reasonable quickly after purchase thanks for any counsel rattles as far as i heard its true w the previous tl but i never heard of such complaint with the new tl the 325xi might seem a bit underpowered but its all about your preferences with g35x youll get the power but sacrifice the comfort and luxury due to its harsh ride and low quality materials th tl has both power and comfort for 33k quite a decent offer if power is on top of your list the g is worthy but if you want luxury along w it you might wanna consider the bmw or the tl hope this helps i was in the same situation except i was looking at the 330i and tl and i chose the g35x and every day i drive this car it just lets me know i made the right decision the best part of this car is at the bottom of my feet the pedals its like an extention of my body it just does what i want it to do velostic with all due respect youre missing the point of the cts this car was never designed to look drive or handle like the larger models especially the deville or the old outgoing seville i for one am very happy that this car is nowhere near the handling road feel or performance or my old deville also the cts already has a v8 modelthe hot rod ctsv there is no indication that there will be any other kind of v8 version of this car in nonhot rod form thanks for the reply right before i saw your response i punched up the 330xi looks like that would be a more fair compartor vs the tl and g35x it looks though like it will be north of what i am willing to spend i am going to go back and drive all 3 again and try to decide thanks for your help thanks for your response i am curious about your comment on the low quality materials on the g35x would you be able to elaborate a bit  this car for me is about being fun to drive our other car is a 2004 acura mdx which acts as family wagon i need the practicality of a sedan but beyond that i want something that will perform well and be a fun ride and age well my boss has a 325 and says it drives with 100k miles like it was new i have had great luck with 3 nissans so just when i was about to eliminate the g35x i decided to keep it in the mix thanks again for your insight i went through a similar decision last year and ended up with the tl not sure how much snow you get where you are but the front wheel drive of the tl handles the white stuff quite well the car is definitely fun to drive and the at version does not have any real torque steer to be concerned with i reaaly liked the performance characteristics of the g35 but could not warm up to the interior the 330 was a little out of my price range and the general small interior size of the 3 series also did not work for me all 3 are great vehicles however enjoy the decision making process brew thanks much just when i think i am leaning in one direction i get a note like yours and i am back to undecided i think the 330 is going to be out of my range also but i figured i would at least check it out as far as the snow goes i am in northern nj so some winters are real bad some not so much need the fwd or awd for piece of mind though i have rwd suv now and i buying this car because the suv is a tobaggan in the snow one question i have read in another forum about a problem with vibration on the tl at highway speeds 55  60 mph have you had any experience with this  again thanks for the counsel cdost1 i am curious about your comment on the low quality materials on the g35x would you be able to elaborate a bit  well compared to the other 2 the g35 just feels a lot cheaper inside the plastic feels and looks cheap and imo the leather seats are overly firm and many people said the seats hurts their backs on long rides\\non the positive side i wont deny that the g is fun to drive while id say the tl is the least fun to drive since it doesnt handle as nicely as the other 2 fwiw  ive made it through the last 3 winters with allseasons on my 3 series traction control does wonders the only

maintenance costs sounds a lot like peoples criteria in a significant other 0 httpwwwtheautochannelcomfnews20041203294261html isnt reason 3 and 8 part and parcel of one another thats a great list but isnt 13678910 very subjective putting it another way why would anyone buy an overpriced unreliable poor performing low quality expensive to maintain car the size of a matchbox are there any new models that actually meet that criteria i dunno im not sure how jd power conducted the study some of it do sound redundant i guess it makes sense that most of that stuff is subjective since if people bought based just on objective criteria wed all be driving the same thing 1 did surprise me though didnt think styling was that important since we spend most of our time inside the car not looking at it no wonder car makers spend so much time agonizing over the design im also surprised that safety didnt make it on the list maybe americans are just superficial and care only about the here and now blueguy lmao what the only one that is subjective is 1 and if number 1 is so important i guess if toyota made better looking cars theyd own the world dont get me started with bmw i agree with your question about safety dont we car about how safe a car is i can understand the styling aspect the car has got to fit inside and out even for those that buy car appliances i would think the styling has got to matter considering how much time most of us spends in a car blueguy lol designman styling is subjective but most people i know love the looks of the new 357 including me bmw makes handsome timeless vehicles dont get me started now ok kd we wont start each other up which reminds me think ill put on some stones is mb dropping free maintenance if so anyone seen what they are now recommending for maintenance what are the pre and post intervals technical editor mike miller has some fascinating comments in the february 2005 issue of bimmer magazine as mike points out in his article on manual transmission and differential fluid changes prefree recommended maintenance intervals\\n 1200 mile breakin service\\n oil changes every 3000 miles\\n automatic transmission fluid and filter change every 15000 miles\\n manual transmission fluid change every 30000 miles\\n differential fluid changed every 30000 miles\\n brake fluid chance annually\\n coolant fluid changed every 2 years postfree recommended maintenance intervals\\n no initial break in service except m\\n oil and filter change around 15000 miles\\n no automatic transmission fluid or filter changes\\n no manual transmisison fluid changes\\n no differential fluid changes\\n brake fluid changed every 2 years\\n coolant fluid changed every 3 years he also points out bmw dealership technicians no long open up gearboxes and differentials for repairs instead the factory fix is to buy a bmw remanufactured gearbox or differentialor automatic transmissioninstead no one knows exactly what bmws proprietary atf is so no one knows if there are viable alternatives we do know that bmw dealerships charge about 500 for an atf and filter service mainly due to the price of the atf thats assuming you can get them to do the job which is often not the case yes there has been some conversation a while back in the mb discussions about the issues of dropping the free maintenance you should be able to find it with a search  greetings i just picked up my g35x and have only driven about 50 miles so far but am liking it more and more\\n  this is my first new car and i agonizedobsessed for months over decision of which to buy as we have an eleven year old and drive to ohio two or three times a year a sedan with a somewhat roomy interior was mandated i was loving the saab 95 aero but only with large incentives would i go for a car that stickered for 43k i liked the saab mpg but turbo lag bites saab also had no rear or curtain airbags volvo s80 was also expensive had the airbags but the interior and trunk seemed smallish and was down on power mb audi  bmw 3 were too expensive a friend has the 330 xi and wonders if her thirteen year old will fit much longer\\ni hated the bmw 5 anyway\\n  so here i am awd is fine with me i may be able to finally forego winter tires im across the river in westchester btw coming from a 94 accord lx the inf seems plenty lux for me the mpg should even be better for you coming from an suv i probably paid a little more than i should have but the buying experience was ok ramsey inf had some good quotes try the website good luck and let us know what happens hi\\ni am also across the river in westchester did you buy the car from pepe or in nj how was the buying experience i have looked at the same cars as you have had volvos for years some of the cars you looked at have excellent safety records what do you know about the g35x crash tests are mixedbtw i continue to obsess about which car to buy i am even toying with buying a volvo with osd program to save some money and make a mini vacation out of it i must say the g35x seems like it would be an enjoyable car to drive\\nthanks for your input if youre planning on keeping your car forever you really should do more than the extended intervals on my 3er i do 2 seasonal oil changes a year flush coolantbrake fluid every 3 years and mtfdiff fluid every inspection 2 now all this will be for nought if i trade the car i think this is a lot of the point of the extended intervals we have it in the back of our mind that we ought to trade our car for a bright shiny one that hasnt had 4 oil changes in 60k miles dave howdy aeg i bought from pepe they have some leftovers but they are not going to lose money as there will always be another customer along in the future and they have something that we want i was afraid that dealer servicing would be difficult if i bought from say ramsey and had to go to pepe for service as jersey would be really inconvenient\\n  the salesman did his job as a salesman despite my best efforts to do mine as a consumer but he was a gentleman as was the business manager they both did me a couple of favors that saved me a few bucks i feel that i was not taken advantage of short of a direct plug the big irish fella whose desk is right next to the pumpkin colored fx sold me the car remember though theyre not really about the price dickering at least they still know my name four days later\\n  i havent really flogged the car as i am breaking it in but that gas gauge isnt afraid to move\\n  i happened to catch a discovery channel program about auto safety recently that showed an offset front crash test of a g35 ugly green from 03 and the engineers demonstrated that the results were satisfactory i dont know why nhtsa hasnt posted the results or maybe it was the insurance company people testing the car\\n  saabs policy of glacial changes turned me offwhy cant they do curtain airbags in the 95 the 93 has them but its smaller\\n  the s60 is too small the s80 had everything i wanted but it had less power and felt tighter inside big dee had one awd in nov and seemed willing to deal but the volvo was primarily fwd which im kinda sick of\\n  plus there are the perceived factors correct or not of swedish unreliability and weirdness associated with the saab\\n  id love to visit scandinavia but i wonder if the dollars weakness make the edp economical\\n  every owner and professional review of the g35  g35x that i read was overwhelmingly positive the most prevalent negative from the owners was the gas mileage the fact that ive got a car that is comparable to a 3series with more room japanese reliability and lesser insurance costs for about 10 large less tickles me\\n  i think roadtrack did a multicar comparo of nearluxury sedans a couple of years ago and the g35 won that article really made me investigate the g35 and here i am now\\n  btw i think that pepe has copies of that test available in the showroom\\n  happy shopping thought it interesting that in the december 2004 issue of roundel bmw cca magazine they have a full report on the recent jd powers apeal survey results entry luxury chrysler 3002005 acura tl and tie lexus is300 sedansportcross  cadillac cts the 3 series doesnt make the top 3 in its segment hard to believe it doesnt esp when the 5  7 series  z4 did go figure apeal is based on owner delight with design content layout and the performance of their new vehicle done after 90 days of ownership after 6 years it dropped out of the top 3 lets see what the new e90 has to offer the g35 claimed the top spot for resale value in the near luxury category this car really is doing wonders for infinitis image in many different ways httpmoneycnncom20041208pfautosresidual_valueindexhtm cnnyes btw i think these are the final months for the i35 although no one talks about this car it was probably the most important vehicle in infinitis history without its steady sales for the last 10 years the infiniti brand most definitely would have folded as bmw was the best luxury brand overall alg also said this as bmw was the best luxury brand overall   best when it comes to combining luxury aspects w funtodrive factor something most japanese cars dont have joeshan   hey thanks for all the information still agonizing so i think i am going to have my wife drive the cars as well and come up with a consensus although i will have veto power  my car  she just got her car a 2004 acura mdx   my understanding there is a seperate forum to discuss price and buying experience if you would not mind it would be great to know what you paid also i got the impression you bought a 2004 is that the case  i have some price information from edmunds on the 2005 but not the 2004 i suspect i will probably buy the car in nj at one of the 2 local dealers down by me summit and denville unless somebody knocked me out with a deal based on your comments that seems unlikely   thanks for all of your comments i may go out today and narrow it down some more probably down to the bmw and gx with a slight chance on the tl i think i am now leaning to the gx though ill post details when i finally decide   regards cdost1 paid maybe a little too much3300000 for an 04 g35x with premium full size spare wood trim which looks really nice with willowits grown on me and splash guards oh well were happy   is the tl a lot smaller wow no wonder acura is concerned about sales what with 12 in the whole city there are actually 13 in the city   unfortunately 13 never shows up at our meets because hes always busy taking his bmw to the shop on the weekends unfortunately 13 never shows up at our meets because hes always busy taking his bmw to the shop on the weekends    what youre really saying is the bmw is the gopher to and from the acura shop the only reason i ever visit my acura shop is for a free car wash while i have a free muffin and latte isnt this special   in five years time itll be interesting to see where the two brands are relative to where they are today   given how the euro vs the  vs the asian currencies are trending combined with the longterm and initial for that matter reliability numbers are headed im not sure id want to be holding european   as often happens im almost as happy to be wrong heck  i never have to visit my bmw dealer for the muffin latte and car wash they send over the car wash crew muffins and latte right to my house other than that i have near zero contact with bmw or any other service center they send over the car wash crew muffins and latte right to my house   oh yeah the entire acura service department came to my house last week and remodeled my bathroom put up all my xmas lights and then baked lemon pound cakes for the whole culdesac  no waitmy wife made the pound cakes oh yeah  well can you top this that acura infiniti and lexus have historically superior customer service and vehicle reliability you can argue with the methodology and results but them has been the apples for about 15 years in a row or more going back to the 1980s these three built their dealer network from scratch in brand new facilities audi bmw and mb were stuck with the dealers theyve had for decades these three built their dealer network from scratch in brand new facilities   does that really matter lincoln and cadillac have also been near the top in these surveys and theyve been around a lot longer than the germans lincoln set a new record in the last csi survey   plus you can get a basic service on a northstar cadillac thats 8 quarts of oil for 13 at my dealership the latte and muffins better be pretty darn good to make up for that its not necessarily true that all lexus dealers were built from scratch when lexus started in late 1989 i know several nj area lexus dealers that started in buildings that previously sold  serviced other brands one lexus dealer that opened in 4th qtr 89 was a volvo dealer before eaton53 would be interesting to compare market share sales reliability and customer satisfaction date for both cadillac and lincoln in 1985 before a i  l and then in the postail era ie say 1990 1995 2000 and 2004 c  l like a bmw  mb learned some hard lessons   maxhonda99 did they renovate the building significantly a i  l had completely new franchise agreements when they came on line and they deliberately started off with small networks in an attempt to better manage customer service issues visavis dealers the only changes were the addition of the lexus dealership look you know the beigebrown stucco exterior interior stayed pretty much the same except with the obvious furniture change   a new franchise agreement doesnt necessarily mean the new franchisee has to build totally new buildings ultimately any car showroom can be used to sell any other cars with slight modifications like a window where customers can look into the service bays breakfast area for customers etc would be interesting to compare market share sales reliability and customer satisfaction date for both cadillac and lincoln in 1985   i dont think most of the surveys existed before about 1990 i believe mb was at the top early on and have been on the downslide for a long time   id guess that cadillac and lincoln were pretty bad at the beginning but are near the top now cadillacs one of the few in the top 5 in iqs vdi and csi for 2004 only 3 brands have managed to pull off this trifecta  lexus and buick are the others cdost   im near you i tried the gx awd i was not impressed with the way it handled on the highway lots of road noise and the brakes were really really touchy common complaint the summit infinit dealer is very nice   denville dealer is nice just wont go down on their prices   have you considered the fx by infiniti thats really nice and you might be able to scoop up a really good deal on a 2004   snagged a 325xi wagon elsewhere c 12000 miles certified but havent been impressed with the gas mileage yet if i had known might have picked the fx if presented with a really good deal but this summer was cringing at gas prices   i read somewhere that the acura is kind of junkybut thats only gossip to be checked out on that board   hope that helps good luck road noise is a common thing in a g35 brakes arent that touchy imo try merc eclass now thats touchy while i like the way g35 rwd handles the awd version is less impressive somehow maybe its just me but the gxs handling isnt as responsive as its rwd version cargal   thanks for the headsup i am actually heading out the door in about 30 minutes with my wife to drive both the 325xi and the g35x i have quotes on both and i can honestly say i am not sure what i will do the acura is off the list i am not crazy about the look   ill let you all know what we do   cdost in regards to the g35 touchy brakes when i testdrove a 2004 g35 that was a big concern of mine when i went back for another drive i drove a 2005 and the touchyness was gone i since learned that the 2005s have larger brake rotors than the 2004s btw i was also not crazy about the 2004 interior but they improved that too can you share the quote on the g35x  in addition to the quote if you got one please share your opinion on the 325ix vs g35x in their performance and drivability i just drove the 325ix havent driven the infiniti yet hi cdost cargal and everyone   im currently looking for a new car i have the 300c 3s g35 es and tl in my list 300c is off the list because i wasnt impressed by its handling front grill and interior but boy the car was really flying i guess its time to move up to a real entry luxury performance class   test drove the es everything is perfect except for acceleration speed and handling and i guess this one is also off my list   now im leaning towards the last 3 cars i would have taken the tl off my list after reading some comments but i decided not to not yet i havent test driven the car no so crazy about it too many of them on the street   having said that i did some research on the new tl on all car related websites nhtsa and many others im quite surprised that es04 has more trans failures than all those 3s followed by 3s g35 and tl04 i couldnt find any about trans failure on tl04 is this for real but more on bmw304 g3504 and especially the es04   im going to test drive the g35 this afternoon and 330325 later on im hoping that g35 is the one i love that sexy looking car   one question though i read some post that the g35x is not as fast as the g35 and i also heard the 6mt has problems with its transmission according to some infiniti just hasnt issued a recall unless more people complain is there any other things that i should look at i understand that the interior is probably the cheapest among the other 3 but i can live with that   thanks darren trans failure was common on tls pre 04 models but i rarely heard of such problem happening to newer models while imo the tl is the fastest it doesnt handle as nicely as the other 2 particularly the torque steer and sometimes floaty ride at high speeds   the gx is slower true and somehow its handling isnt as impressive as the rwd model as well i never drove the 6mt so i cant say anything about it also if ridecomfort is on your list you really should try before buying since many people including me think the rides harsh and uncomfy on longer rides one more thing try the seats for a while to make sure youre comfortable w it the seats controls are awkwardly placed and might hurt you on longer rides   3ers are ok quite underpowered and overpriced though i say comfort is better than the g but still second to the tl oh and prepare yourself for minor electrical problems common w any bmw models   hope it helps goodluck darrenw if you are looking at bmw 325i or 330i and you looked at the lexus es330 you should consider the lexus is300 both 325i and is300 are rwd and similar in size   the is300 has consistently scored well with consumer reports jd powers and intellichoice and its crash test results for nhtsa and iihs have been very good lexus has better standard warranty though bmw has free maintenance believe lexus extended warranty is much less expensive than bmws folks   saw all the posts i will try to answer them as succintly as possible   i eliminated the the tl pretty quickly liked the drive not that crazy about the look i just bought an mdx two months ago   first on my quotes the best i could do on the 325xi in nj was 36299 on the 330xi 40299 these quotes included premium pkg leather upgraded stereo auto transmission wood trim the quotes came from 2 different dealers jmk 325xi flemington 330xi i dont think the mats are typically included in the bmw pricing but i did not really haggle here since i ended up purchasing a g35x   after driving all 3 cars i decided on the infiniti i think i liked the tighter handling of the bmw but the 325xi just seemed way underpowered compared to a g35x this just was my feel i am sure a bmw loyalist would argue i dont know what i am talking about but that is what it felt like to me the 330xi would have been great more power than the 325xi and tighter than the g35x but i could not rationalize the additional 6500 in price for a car with less backseat and room with a 3 year old   i saw the posts on the rwd and really cannot comment since i wanted an awd and only drove them again speed and power seemed relative and a rwd was not in the decision set   the g35x felt nice to me my last 2 cars were maximas it handled nicely and had plenty of pep believe it or not it seemed to run quieter than the 325xi as well   the last thing is i have had 3 nissans and none of them owed me anything when i gave them up all with 8  10 years and 150k miles that was the final factor   i am picking it up tomorrow and assuming i do not jerked around at the last minute my 2005 g35x will cost 34250 with premium c pkg full size spare and wood trim the only thing not in here is ttl splash guards are not available at the moment on the 2005 g35x   i hopes this helps everyone   if i have any surprises i will chime back in   regards craig thanks for the replies guys   i test drove the g35 yesterday after i started the car i ve noticed some rattle noises chattering gear noise when launching from a stop it seemed coming from the drivetrain i asked the salesman he said its normal because the engine was cold i couldnt help looking at the rim there was a lot of brake dust how long do they lastbrakes is there any way to improve the ride on the car road and engine noise vibration and stiff suspension   but everything else was perfect except for interior and audio which i dont really care so much i loved its handling and imo its one of the best looking cars i told my wife that i didnt want to go to any other place but she insisted to go to a bmw dealership apparently she didnt like the ride welltough luck charlie i just didnt want to upset her   went to a bimmer dealership and test drove a 325i the car was too small for us and wasnt powerful enough compared to the g35 although it rode slightly better than the g tighter handling and better interioraudio i guess 325 is out of the picture anyway i decided to test drive the 330i it felt more powerful than the 325 but not the g35 has anyone noticed the wind noise tougher ridevibration slightly better than the g and somehow weak power steering or was it just that car the car was smaller and a lot more expensive   i understand that sporty ride means stiffer suspension i just wish my wife does too   i wanted to go back to the infiniti dealership again a funny thing happened the salesman was upset when i asked about his opinion on acura tl have to admit it made me curious   riez thanks for the suggestion but i think the is is too small for us but im sure its a good car   tommorow i need to go to another g35 and acura dealership hope i can get it before the year end some said its the best time to buy a car   thanks for the info cdost1 greatly appreciated i might go with the rwd is it true that the cars mpg is not that good how bad can it be anyway have a good time and enjoy your new car buddy   m4d_cow eventhough im almost convinced that ill go with the g35 but it doesnt hurt to test drive the tl have to buy it by friday unless the tl has less vibration wind noise engine noise handle as good as the g3s faster than 330 better mpg and softer ride  thanks for your help my opinion of the tl is that using your references it handles significantly better than the es330 but its not as sharp as the g35   on the other hand the tl rides significantly better than the g35 but its not as creamy as the es330   it may turn out to be the perfect sportcomfort mix youre looking for  plus its interior materials and layout are a couple notches above the g35 just in case anyone was wondering heres an update on my tsx relationship   yes i still enjoy the car very much however in spite of the fact that its made car and drivers ten best list for two straight years now my initial impressions are proving to be true   after 18 months of ownership the thrill is starting to fade yes i know  it has a gorgeous cockpit peppy acceleration and nimble handling but like all hondasits lack of soul is beginning to take its toll on me   i might start modding it summer tires rear sway bar coilovers ihe to make it sportier and add some personality or i may finally get serious about leaving this segment behind do i really want to be here and replace it with something more sporting and less luxurious   a 95ish porsche 911 a 98ish bmw m3 or perhaps a brandnew mitsubishi evo rs  theyre all on my mind any thoughtsopinions one could get this instead   httpwwwcarscomgosearchdetailjsptracktypeusedccse

doesnt this is a ctsv with 851 miles on it under 40k yeah but you dont know how those 851 miles were really spent the link works but i would think long and hard about getting a 57 hemi in this era of 2gallon prices   a friend of mine bought a 50k used porsche online after his experience i would never do something like that within two weeks the car was literally falling apart and the seller wouldnt give him money back since it was sold asis he is now suing curious did your friend have a thorough ppi done by a credible source before he bought the porsche you can get beat on any car thats bought out of warranty doesnt matter whether its online newspaper or brickandmortar the buying process should be no different youre getting that soul call aye since you have an eye out for those other cars i dont think the mods you mention are going to do anything for you just start reading about and driving the cars that are beckoning you may want to throw the sti into the mix and if you can forsake utility drive the miata s2000 and boxster roadster sales are horrendous and you can come up with great deals nothing beats roadsters and 911s for pure driving fun also evo and sti are bangforbuck cool be careful about catching the porsche disease because there may be no turning back and it could be an expensive proposition 99 m3 01 porsche boxster   911 is a great idea absurdly expensive to buy used   if you dont want a convertible the e36 m3 is a good choice   regards kyfdx but i would think long and hard about getting a 57 hemi in this era of 2gallon prices   ctsvs are rated at 1625 only a couple of mpg less than a g35 plus you dont have to get on it to go really fast the vette engine has always been noted for getting excellent gas mileage for such a powerful engine   ive seen plenty of reports on th of g35s getting bad gas mileage but i havent seen that argument as much of a reason not to buy it   plus the performance difference between a g35 and a ctsv is significant to put it mildly   a friend of mine bought a 50k used porsche online after his experience i would never do something like that   this is a dealer not some guy selling online i bought my miata by finding it online then going to the dealer who was a couple of hundred miles away full factory warranty 4 years50k mileswould be in effect as well   i certainly wouldnt be fearful of a car with 851 miles on it not to voice an opinion to the contrary but gas mileage estimates mean nothing a friend of mine drives a vette in the same traffic pattern i do 15mpg average mileage yeah they get good mileage going downhill with a tailwind in the right traffic conditions   but otoh its only 1 mpg less than the estimates however by nature i would not consummate this type of sale for a used car thats why i dont buy demos but thats me however by nature i would not consummate this type of sale for a used car thats why i dont buy demos but thats me   when i bought my miata it was almost 3 years old but only had 11k miles on it ran a carfax and it turned out it had had 3 owners none of them private it had been a ford executive car and owned by 2 dealerships  driven by them but not sold no problem bought the car and other than it having a broken roof latch header when i got it fixed under warranty which still had a few months to go its been perfect   so ive got no problem with doing this kind of deal especially when you get 10k off before negotiations start and youre going to get almost all of the factory warranty unless the tl has less vibration wind noise engine noise handle as good as the g3s faster than 330 better mpg and softer ride   well the tl has all on your list except for the handling still quite a few notch below g3ers tls ride and comfort are practically the best among the 3 choices   id have chosen the tl when i bought my car if only it doesnt have that annoying torque steer and im not crazy about the looks for sure the 330s ride is harsher cos its equipped w sport suspension standard on all 330is though sadly the gs ride is still harsher compared to bmws w sport suspension   so if you can sacrifice a little handling the tl is totally worth it   designman 911 cabrio or targa is my dream car ive been working hard and was so close to getting one of those until my car crashed i know how that isthere are some cars i should love based on the spec sheet but just leave me saying bleh thats the main reason i never traded my e36 for an e46 i didnt feel as connected to the car   i think theres nothing wrong with using a subjective like as your main criteria after all most of us could be perfectly well served driving old saturns   dave i spent some significant time behind the wheel of an 85 911 i know that was a long time ago and was totally unimpressed the suspension was shockingly soft allowing major body roll dive and lift depending on which pedal you were pressing also had the bizarre floor mounted pedals this was still in the days of dropthrottle oversteer i was amazed that this was considered a premium enthusiasts car hmm i owned an 84 911 targa from 9094 definitely lacking in the clutchshifter department but i loved it   of course it was my dream car so i may be a bit biased   regards kyfdx of course we are all biased glad you enjoyed your 911 at the time i drove the porsche i actually owned a toyota corolla gts before you laugh this was the rwd coupe with the mr2 engine 18 liters 7500 redline with perfectly neutral handling it would never oversteer or understeer just develop a nice controlled four wheel drift as grip went away very reassuring handling taught me the value of neutral handling and rwd a friend of mine still owns one of those unfortunately it is an automatic and has seen better days   i still remember driving the gen i mr2 what a hoot that was to drive almost made the salesman quit his job on the test drive i am currently hot for a 6mt tsx as anyone whos looked knows they are very few and far between in the midwest the dealers would love to move me up to a tl which is doable but really exceeds what i want to spend also feel like i would have to go to at in the tl due to high power and torque steer i do appreciate that this is not a bad place to be sorry to hear about your crash hope no one was hurt you can probably get a lowmileage 85 911 for about 20 grand but this time make sure it has shocks on the front end  since you have an eye out for those other cars i dont think the mods you mention are going to do anything for you   my heart knows youre right on this point   you may want to throw the sti into the mix   i looked at the sti and evo briefly last weekend based on what ive read and seen the evo looks like the more funtodrive package with more bangforthebuck in rs form to boot   and if you can forsake utility drive the miata s2000 and boxster   dont want a 2 seater or a convertable since it needs to be able to haul the kids in a pinch and since i intend to track it i dont want to install roll protection and fivepoint harnesses   99 m3 01 porsche boxster 911 is a great idea absurdly expensive to buy used if you dont want a convertible the e36 m3 is a good choice   great list kyfdx the m3 is probably the best choice since it performs close to the porsche yet has real four person utility honestly though ive never warmed to the e36  which brings me fullcircle back to an e30which has a surprising amount in common with the tsx size stance attitude acceleration tossability etc   hell i should probably stop fooling myself im sure i wont be truly satisfied with anything but a 993 so many emotions to contend with yep youre showing symptoms of the disease  the cure is lower priced than manymost surgeries thanks noone was hurt although i have to get a new car now as the car was totalled and the other party was uninsured which means an almost 40k loss and now my sister starts begging me for a 350z which will be another 30k on shopping list means ill have to work hard another year or two to get my 911 ouch your insurance wouldnt cover the car   there are a lot of uninsured drivers in colorado so its almost mandatory to have some form of uninsuredunderinsured coverage   they even check to make sure you have insurance liability when you get pulled over for traffic violations or when you register your car of course there are ways of getting around that   my wife wrote a paper on automobile insurance and the economics of a faultno fault basis for insurance just out of curiosity what state are you in sadly uninsuredunderinsured coverage isnt mandatory here i dont have that coverage on my policy so oh well bad luck for me the other party turned out to be dui and uninsured i dont know whats happening to him probably in the slammer by now heck i wish he is he smashed a chevy s10 to an almost brand new 330i btw i live in wa and frankly i dont know much about the law regarding insurance stuffs here i decided not to go for a lawsuit as its more of a waste

obviously big hits and brilliant strategy by acura the tl is the volume leader being build in ohio and the tsx which was budgeted at 15000 units per year has doubled demand no wonder they are so hard to find is cts 36 the top selling single model of rwd sports sedan in the us sure looks that way   whoda thunk it just a few years ago try wwwprnewswirecom you can look at sales figures and spin the numbers anyway you want uglier than the aztek   in your opinion but then it wasnt meant to appeal to everyone   its a lot better than some blandmobile that no one really cares about and from the sales figures it seems a whole lot of people really like it plus it hasnt gotten tired sales have increased every year since it came out i looked at all the caddys at the autoshow and was not impressed first thing is the 42000 sticker for a heavy underpowered lux over sport vehicle then you have to look at it 300c beats caddy at their own game for 57k less and if you prefer a little sporting character with your lux all three japanese premium brands had superior styling quality content and value euros have the hardware if you want to pay a 510k premium what is even more surprising is looking down market for a mainstream 4door sedan it is incredible how outtolunch the domestics are ford 500 are you kidding me first thing is the 42000 sticker for a heavy underpowered lux over sport vehicle   very high end of the scale there most cts arent anywhere near that much and there are obviously a large number of people like their sports sedans not to beat them up   its also a bigger car many people also appreciate the space it offers   the 36 is underpowered only in some alternate universe 255 hp and 252 lbft of torque on regular gas   then you have to look at it 300c beats caddy at their own game for 57k less   have you driven one i have the 300c is not nearly as good as an all around vehicle fast in a straight line sure but throw in some corners and theres lots of body roll and tire squeal caddys dont do any of that   300c lacks the chassis composure to be a sports sedan its a fast cruiser   and if you prefer a little sporting character with your lux all three japanese premium brands had superior styling   in your opinion imo except for the g35 theyre bland too small or have wrong wheel drive    quality   cadillac is one of only 3 manufacturers in the top 5 of all 3 power surveys only one of the others is japanese sorry but the surveys dont back up these superior quality claims   content and value   theyre all loaded and cost similar amounts nothing there   euros have the hardware if you want to pay a 510k premium   for a less reliable product not that i like getting caught up in the useless sales numbers but i had to ask why there is a discrepancy between shapiros numbers and dannys numbers   if i add up all of dannys 3series numbers i get less than 69k i didnt do exact just a rough addup in my head but shaps obviously shows almost 40k more than that whats missing coupes and convertibles did they really sell almost 40k coupes and convertibles thats a huge number for niche styles like that coupes convertibles and wagons i think that would do it but the original post says 325i and 330i i would think that would include wagons since wagons also have those same designations the only things missing are the ci but maybe youre right and wagons arent in there i dont know too lazy to look but i think it said sedans only   that makes lexus sales look better in comparison dontchaknow since they dont offer coupes in those models oops yer right it was right there in the title of the post no wagons   yeah the es looks to be popular but the is and gs numbers are downright pitiful qbrozen cant say i agree with your statement yeah the es looks to be popular but the is and gs numbers are downright pitiful   i would agree that lexus should be ashamed of how little they advertisemarket both the is and gs given that lexus does next to nothing to promote either and that both are in the last my of their current platform id say sales are absolutely amazingly good   is300 sedan holding up compared to bmw 330i sedan   and the gs competes against a different class of cars eclass a6 and 5 series   if you add up all the lexus sedan saleses gs and islexus dealers are happy plus about 50 of all lexus sales are suvs suvs are where lexus action has been for about 5 years now well comparing just the 330i to the is300 is not quite kosher just because lexus doesnt offer 2 engine choices in their car or the option of awd does not justify limiting 3series sales to one option   less than 7k cars is quite pitiful imho toyota decided to kill the celica after it sold more than double that number in 2003 so why kill a car with 15k sales and keep one with 7k   im not arguing as to why it suffers in sales just that it does i looked at all the caddys at the autoshow and was not impressed   hm i drove the cts at gms autoshow in motion back to back with the tl i think the only way the tl was better is that its interior quality was somewhat better aside from that the cts handled better was more spacious and the engine felt better  quieter smoother less peaky    the cts stickers for a smidge less than the tl and you can surely get a bigger discount on it unfortunately that smidge cheaper cts is lacking in content compared to the tl add in the 8k 1sc package and youve just blown the tls price out of the water you can get a cts anyway you want it if you want to pay more you can if you want it stripped you can get that too two different engines auto or manual with either one and they all drive the rear wheels   just because you want that stuff doesnt mean everyone does i just got my g35 am happy and very excited   md4cow was right the tl had all the stuff that we all wanted better ride powerful yet quiet smooth engine good handling good mpg interior tons of features although im not a techy person but boy the navigation and its voice command over temperatureradio etc really impressed me a lot   but too bad they wouldnt budge for more discount   im quite happy with the g especially when the car will only be driven by me my family just cant handle the ride   imo the tl is more like a handsome muscular looking car while the g is more to the sweet and exotic type eventhough the tl rode  turned as flat as the g but i do believe theres a hair difference somewhere the salesman was with me so i didnt have a chance to feel the torque steer did go fast into a corner but i guess it was not fast enough   thanks for all the info guys really happy with this experience darrenw   curious on what you decided i have had my g35x for about 10 days now and so far know regrets even had it out in some wet snow tonight and it was fine   i found that all of the cars in the mix you were looking at did not have such great mpg if you are talking about these high powered engines i suspect this has something to do with it it looks to me that i will be getting somewhere around 325 to 350 miles on a tank with all the city driving i do not much different than explorer my infiniti replaced   the only reason i nixed the tl was just looks it drove nice and actually had a few more features for less money since it was fwd vs awd   hope you found the car you wanted   regards cdost well it has little to do with what i want it has to do with comparing comparable cars dont get me wrong i think its great that someone can buy a stripped cts if they want but that doesnt mean its comparable to the tl but that doesnt mean its comparable to the tl   sorry but because of its inherently flawed fwd design no tl is superior to a cts no matter how many gadgets you pile onto it   proper sports sedans are driven by the rear wheels or with rwd based awd for some reason acura hasnt figured this out when everyone else has groan yeah lets dig up that horse again yeah lets dig up that horse again   well youre right theres no point to digging it up until someone builds a fwd sports sedan that can run with the really big dogs of the sports sedan universe then you can come on and proclaim its superiority congrats on both your purchases   darren to add the info tls nav system is considered one of the most userfriendly system in the market nowadays   cdost the mpg stuff makes me wonder some people claim the tl have better mpg than g35 while others claim the opposite and until now i still have no clue which one is right then you can come on and proclaim its superiority   by you i presume you mean any person in general and not me because you wont see me doing it id rather proclaim one cars advantages over another and not argue in generalized terms since it does very little to further a discussion someone a while back posted the sales  for 2004 and it seems that the best selling entry luxo sedans in us last year were the inferior fwders es and tl how the heck could that happen the universe must be educated more by the rwdwing not really buying into the whole sales equals capability thing   if that were the case id get me an f150 and head down to the track to race for titles actually again to correct some wording to avoid confusion and possible useless debate i think you mean to say not buying the whole sales equals performance thing because the f150 is quite capable of doing many things a sports sedan is not   and i only say this because i know it will turn into fwd is capable of xyz better than rwd or whatever   isnt there a topic for fwd vs rwd vs awd by the way good thing you are not running a car co   capability for what tr fine go with rwd but is that what everyones only need to be based on far from it dont overgeneralize whats the best even for those in this segment some go all the way to performance some lean more on luxury some take a blend of both whos to say whats the best not you or me but each one for their own good thing you are not running a car co   tell that to bmw then they obviously dont know what theyre doing even though what i advocate is basically what they make sedans with the emphasis on sport   when the top luxury sports sedans are named no fwd cars or plushmobiles are on that list those lists are filled with mcars and those capable of challenging them and to challenge them youd better have a chassis thats up to the task of providing supercar performance 4 doors and a pretty good level of luxury   sorry but nothing of the tls and ess ilk is going to be up to that challenge you think bmws goal is really to make capable cars no its simply make money which is directly from sales anything else is just a means to get there if you want to run bmw or any co you got to get that straight thats why i said good thing you are not running one   i was not arguing tl being a supercar its not i was just saying lots of people 2nd to es for entry luxo but ok es is not a performance sedan last year voted their wallet on tl for its blend of sportiness and luxury anything wrong with these people i think not sup folks   just saw the new a6 on the street in dc and i must say i was impressed i had read comments from posters in this and other forums including auto rag reviews which did not sound too promising especially in reference to the new grillschnoze some call itbut after seeing the vehicle up close the grill appears to be well integrated with the overall design subjectively of course however i think the previous models tail lenses look better that the new ones good looking car though any comments i dont really know much about the a6 since ive never driven one but looks great i didnt like the new grille at 1st as well but grew to like it like you said its well integrated to the whole design the old rear end design is nice but wont look good on the new one imo you think bmws goal is really to make capable cars no its simply make money   and one isnt one used as a means get you the other also using your logic they should just quit building the m cars cadillac should dump v etc they dont make enough of them to turn much if any of a profit so the aura these great cars create really doesnt have any value   i was not arguing tl being a supercar   im seeing people in here proclaiming the tls superiority to other vehicles that are not only capable of reaching the supercar level but have actually done it when the top luxury sports sedans are named   named by who what list are you talking about are you maybe referring to cds recent 10 best you mean that list of one car in each category they dont say who else is on the list competing against it in that particular segment but im sure the tl was in that group then again maybe not since the tsx won best sports sedan indicating they feel acura is not luxurious enough but this does bring up an interesting point if you feel this list is indicative of what they consider sporty and that it is restricted to rwd for this purpose then why did the tsx win the same award as bmw except simply lacking the luxury pigeonhole im seeing people in here proclaiming the tls superiority to other vehicles that are not only capable of reaching the supercar level but have actually done it   please point out where this has happened thats absurd if anyone really thinks that just as its absurd to think that any car in this category has reached the supercar level i bought my 05 tl for all reasons you listed as tl assets i really liked the g35x power and flat handling but more important to me than 1010ths handling i was looking for a smoother quiter ride with good handling and as a new englanderskier rwd was not that attractive hence i looked at the g35x fwd has always served me well so even with the improved tractionsafety of awd the added weight and complexity were not appealing to me   as far as deals go for either the g or the tl boston area seems the place to be i had no trouble negotiating the tl at invoice from two different dealers   ive never driven a cts but was so turned off by exteriorinterior style and interior materials that i knew it wasnt the car for me while the styling may be overboard at least like chrysler with the new 300 they took a chance unlike ford which will still probably sell a lot of 500s to noncar people   g35 or tl whichever you buy you win or whatever car you buy because if you bought it its the best it just doesnt matter what car mags sales figures or edmunds message board experts say fwiw dept i think the a6 looks fine even with the schnozz i saw one in a sort of copperpumpkin color that was beautiful

on_id15page_number1   hey the 1st and 3rd place cars are none other than cadillac cts the very car that the tl is supposedly superior to   just as its absurd to think that any car in this category has reached the supercar level   heh heh lets change that to its absurd to think that a car in this category with such pedestrian underpinnings as the tl can reach anywhere near the the supercar level   ill now repeat those that have actually done it those would be the cts and 3series lol i think everybody thinks that supercars are like lamborighini porche ferrari viper etc that is the common conception and no such a thing like vw and mitsubishia company who struggle to survive are being competed as the supercar unless its a super car   this contest is like the beauty contest that i saw in thailand when i was on vacation in 2000 everyone thinks theres gonna be a lot of pretty girls common conception about supercarsuper beauty but super actually meant a contest with a heavy really heavy modification i asked one of the girl named ferrari in the audience  you are very attractive why dont you go and compete she said no very quickly real girl wont compete with these queens why because we cant keep up with the demand   will you marry the prettiest girl of that contest why the sales was not good   guess who turned out to be a winner a drag queen but he was really pretty and acutally much prettier than that girl he just doesnt sell much in his ordinary life why they used the word beauty because they wanted to improve the nonselling queen and also beer salesbeer  mod partsgadgets   a low grade civic volkswagon vw mitsubishi can be modded to achieve supercar level but thats not the point only a few vehicle were being competed so there is no loser among those who didnt competeor didnt want to unless the lexusacurainfiniti was in and lost but one thing for sure nothing can beat the natural beauty   ill now repeat those that have actually done it those would be the cts and 3series  nobody is saying that tl is the supercar but cts ers why you didnt say that earlier thank god well isnt this special   does anyone answer direct questions or is that considered somehow inappropriate eaton53  proper sports sedans are driven by the rear wheels   well since you respect car and driver enough to provide a link why not explain why they picked the fwd acura tsx as their best sports sedan two years in a row   eaton53  im seeing people in here proclaiming the tls superiority to other vehicles that are not only capable of reaching the supercar level but have actually done it   thanks i enjoyed your link someone spent 70000 to modify a ctsv and it came in 1st place im not sure how this answers gbrozens question but im sure that with a 70000 budget someone could build a tl thats a competitive supercar   btw when are you going to answer gbrozens question and show us where people proclaimed the tls superiority an acura tl finished 1st in class and 3rd overall at the 25 hours of thunderhill race in willows ca   httpwwwnasaproracingcomenduro25hour2004_recaphtml   some notable quotes   the main surprise of the early hours was the strong showing of hondapowered sedans near the top of the order   the honda research acura tl proved that four door luxury racecars are plenty competitive by blowing the doors off the e0 field and taking the final spot on the overall podium can fit on the head of a pin lets argue about that for a while makes about as much sense as arguing which is the best entrylevel luxury performance sedan   if you parse out this forums title youll probably get agreement on sedan and perhaps on entry level there will be no consensus on best luxury or performance   so instead of trying to convince people which sedan is best period which is impossible tell us which sedan was best for you that may help people determine what is best for them   carry on  an acura tl finished 1st in class and 3rd overall at the 25 hours of thunderhill race in willows ca   did they let them drive those cars home anyone with the cash can buy the supercars i posted and legally drive them wherever they want or they can go buy the autotrader car i linked to and get pretty darn close for less than 40k   car and driver enough to provide a link why not explain why they picked the fwd acura tsx as their best sports sedan two years in a row   if you got no money its fine but the tsx couldnt make this list any more than the subarus could the ctsv is 1 at both road  track and automobile   im not sure how this answers gbrozens question but im sure that with a 70000 budget someone could build a tl thats a competitive supercar   if ifs and buts were candy and nuts every day would be christmas wheres the car   btw when are you going to answer gbrozens question and show us where people proclaimed the tls superiority   no ones arguing it then great that its settled i dont have to argue it any more either yeah thats great but you really daned around that one were you really trying to prove that a heavily modified vehicle is better than a tl hey congrats on that win bud   did you forget the title of the topic apparently you did how bout taking another look at the top of the board to remind yourself the ctsv modified or not is not an entry level luxo sports sedan and once again nothing in this class is a supercar can it be made to perform like one with enough money of course i can make a toaster beat the heck out of an m3 with enough money but neither would fall into this category how bout taking another look at the top of the board to remind yourself the ctsv modified or not is not an entry level luxo sports sedan   just looked and now youre telling me a ctsv is not a cts now thats absurd i suppose a 330i is also not a 3series different motor sports packages are there also   the barrier here has been price but ive also shown how to get a ctsv for less than many of the cars in this topic even provided the link so thats out the window but hey when you cant compete you deny and say it doesnt fall into the category utter nonsense   can it be made to perform like one with enough money i can make a toaster beat the heck out of an m3 with enough money but neither would fall into this category   again at the top of this category it says cts the ctsv is a cts you can get one for less than 40k and to top it off now you claim you can make a toaster perform like one with enough money yet you produced neither the toaster or the mythical car   fish or cut bait wheres the car did they let them drive those cars home   wheres the car   quote from a website that townhall rules prohibit me from linking    the team had only ninety days to prepare a stock tl to nasa honda challenge specifications while the engine drivetrain and brake system remained stock the team augmented the tls 32 liter v6 with a cold air intake and a custom exhaust header from prototype racing a large diameter exhaust a lightweight flywheel and a performance clutch were provided by comptech usa the suspension was modified with custom hr coilovers a progress adjustable rear sway bar and adjustable spc camber ball joints and links lightweight enkei racing wheels and toyo ra1 race compound tires were used for increased grip   thats a fwd luxury sedan with stock engine drivetrain and brakes  and it finished 3rd in a 25hour endurance race against porsches bmws and cobras   the ctsv is 1 at both road  track and automobile   so whats that got to do with the 33000 cts 36l were talking about in this forum the saleen cobra is an awesome car but does that make the v6 mustang your sister drives a topnotch sport coupe   seriously lets just leave the ctsv and that ridiculous 120000 mallet out of this discussion ok   in my opinion the tl is a fine choice in this segment for someone who wants solid 810ths handling a great enginepowertrain and top quality materials and amenities the cts again in my opinion may offer 910ths handling but in a package that is larger it has the wheelbase of a range rover short on amenities and has subpar material quality and polarizing styling   the bottom line is  both the acura tl and cadillac cts are fine 33000 choices the better car is simply the one that possesses the characteristics that each of us value on an individual basis   to dismiss the tl because of its fwd layout is just as absurd as dismissing the cts because of its unconventioanl styling if its not your cup of tea fine but that doesnt make it inferior weve been around and around about this and as your host i defined the vehicles that belong in this topic in this message pat entrylevel luxury performance sedans 1446 19 mar 2004 534 pm   the ctsv is not one of them and it generally is more expensive and of a different class than the cars we are talking about as i noted in that message i just linked anyone is free to find or start another comparo if this one does not suit your purposes   note that there is only room for six vehicles in the categories you are seeing above thats why they dont all appear there   things are getting a little too personal here  we can disagree with each other without getting ugly about it lets reel in the emotion a bit please thats a fwd luxury sedan with stock engine drivetrain and brakes  and it finished 3rd in a 25hour endurance race against porsches bmws and cobras   thats far different than passing all federal standards sorry your example doesnt pass muster   seriously lets just leave the ctsv out of this discussion ok   from every criteria i see here its in i provided the under 40k price link  in fact the last new 04 at my local lealer had a 42k sticker in the windshield certainly not out of this subjects price range   can i help it if the others have too little performance for too much money  from every criteria i see here its in   no it is not i assume you were composing as i was posting   lets move on now thank you can i help it if the others have too little performance for too much money   a 36l engine that can only produce a 255hp is too little performance yes especially if the car cant go under 6 in 060   too much money try to equip all features that tl has cts 36s prices will shoot to the roof that is why less people vote with their wallet on that car hate to burst your bubble but these tuner cars have nothing in common with their factory brethren other than body stampings and some interior bits that a mallet caddy with 700 hp finished 1st has absolutely no relevance to the tl 3series or its own cousin the cts   please brush up on your automotive perspective kinda like comparing the chevy monte carlo with its nascar 4thcousin twice removed raced on sundays   back to reality the tl is certainly competitive to the g 3series cts etc it just offers its own distinct interpretation of the automotive experience to suit drivers that find those characteristics to be valuable good thing that variation exists to please all of us competition also helps to improve the lot sup folks   just finished reading the bmw writeup in the wall st journal today and to me it seems they have just placed what has been known for a while in the public domain issues like styling idrive reliability and competition namely g35 and ctspricewas discussed in this article i guess bimmer fans and passive fans like myself and of course detractors have always known this to be the case weve certainly debated those same issues in these forums quite a bit    i certainly did not get the impression the article was mean to inflame it pointed out bmw sales were up worldwide and in 2003 it made 35billion in profit more than gm ford volkswagen and renault combined however its us market share had dropped due to these same issues and also changing demographics   while i am passively in the marketi just paid off my 2000 mazda millennia sif i decide to pull the trigger m35sport g35 tl and jaguar would be my order of preference as i pointed out earlier while i am a passive fan the price of the 3series and its size simply dont do it for me   by the by did anyone see the car and driver marathon this weekend on spike tv just got around to reading my january issue of roundel   nice letter i lsd was wondering lsd if that was him lsd  fedlawman  kominsky ya know what they say everyone has a doppleganger somewhere in the world luckily mine appears capable of trenchant automotive commentary do you guys by any chance know how much im supposed to pay for an 05 x5 30 black on beige premium auto xenon coldweather      one more thing is the pastel green interior available for usspec x5   ive been checking the x5 forums but no answers so far has anyone here purchased a 36 cts lately i am looking and have been for quite some time now the perfect midsize car the cts just entered the equation and it has my interest after reading the road and track comparison i obviously am also looking at the g35 too small for me i think the tl really like it and it is leading at this time but the exterior bores me and the s60 25t nice car good looks but a bit small i think   i dont want to pay the 38k or so that i configured it for and i know that there are deals out there on gm vehicles i read somewhere that somebody got 7500 or so in rebates  incentives   also what do yall think about that comparison of the tl and the cts i know the fwd vs rwd will be the major factor for some but if you can try to rule that out please do   thanks if you disregard rwdfwd the acura tl wins on all fronts   of course that is just my opinionlol   the big one resale if you think you will sell that car anytime within 5 years you will be many thousands ahead with the acura have you driven the cts and tl back to back but thats just on the aesthetic level have you checked out the interior of a cts does the c stand for chevy cavalier and the exterior while differnt is just plain overdone imho of course i havent driven the cts which is probably its saving grace but even if it outdrives the tl which i find to be very handome in and out i could not look at nor sit in the cts every day and be happy   drive em both figure out your priorities and buy whichever you buy is the best car   ymmv i always say what part of your car do you see the most of well its the interior  not the exterior styling and that has always been very important to me thats one reason why my last two cars have been a 98 a4 and a 04 325i both look and feel very nice from the drivers seat   that is also one thing that turned me off when i testdrove a saab 93 before deciding on the 325 the instrument panel of the saab was very complexlooking  dozens of buttons  and with the display for the radio and that other display up under the windshield it definitely didnt do it for me i really like the external styling and the car drove  performed well but i couldnt see myself enjoying the view from the business seat i have driven the tl but not the cts those really are the only 2 i can think of the g is too small 325 is too small the a4 is too small the 93 has gotten terrible reviews   it appears that the cts is just as big as the tl i understand that the fit and finish is not as good in the cts i like the exterior styling of the cts one problem is that the acura dealer is 60 miles away and the cadillac dealer is 2 miles away that is a big deal to me i also am feeling pretty patriotic these days and am leaning to the cts a car i would of never looked at a year ago   it really is tough on paper the acura wins and on the interior the acura wins i prefer the caddy exterior to the tl exterior   the acura is cheaper on msrp as well but i am wondering if the street price of the cts is probably much less than the msrp it has to be so a 38k cts probably costs you 32k or so is what i am thinking does anyone here know   i am looking to lease not buy so that changes things a little bit 1 if you like the cts exterior that counts for something   2 2 miles vs 60 miles to the dealer is another real benefit   3 the lease deals on tls right now are just standard rates no manufacturer support so maybe not that great   4 not sure of the lease deals on the cts but something tells me that the price difference will pretty much disappear if you are leasing maybe even lower on the cts   regards kyfdx another thought billy if winter driving is a consideration for you then fwd vs rwd may take on additional importance theoretically fwd is better in the snow however the nonnavi tl is equipped with bridgestone turanza el42 tires which imo are terrible in the snow too bad i found this out after buying my tl which other than the tires is a great car smooth quiet powerful and handsome inside and out   ive not been stranded were getting another 810 on top of the 30 of snow we got in boston this weekend nor spun but i think that is a combination of my snow driving experience and the tls traction electronics tc vsa abs im somewhat upset with these tires i think they flatspot also i had a chance to drive the tl and cts back to back on a track and in that environment the cts did much better and you can get a lot off the msrp i recall seeing ads in the paper offering 6k off to begin with   now as a daily driver thats not the 1 criteria but im not interested in a car that doesnt make me smile thats just my own personal preference otoh this is a sport sedan topic i drove the cts today for the first time love the exterior the trunk the size the seats and the drive characteristics cannot stand the interior i cannot believe it is on the inside of a 43k car that i looked at i thought that the dimmer switch next to the sunroof opener was going to fall off when i touched it the doors are plastic the dash is plastic the console is plastic the knobs are plastic the middle console is plastic for as much as i love the exterior i cant believe the inside is that bad i am really dissapointed i really thought that the reviews were exaggerating how bad it is i am sorry to those cts owners that i am offending but i truly am surprised and disappointed   i am the only that was that shocked by the interior how on earth did the cts beat the 530 a6 jag e320 in the road and track comparison of the 6 cylinders i do not own any of these vehicle but imo 3xl cts is not likely to be my choice of vehicles tl wins the look interior power reliability  comfort  well almost everything if only tl comes with rwd but it handles pretty well too imo   the g otoh has better handling imo based on its rwd setup but it comes with tougher ride well it depends on your priorities thou but if you choose a rwder dont forget to get winter tires if you live in snow area believe me you wont regret it   good luck the only incentives on the cts is 1500 gm loyalty the biggest discount weve given is 5000 off and that was a demo w 4000 miles on it gm has left the incentives off the cts resale has been excellent re the interior i had the same reaction when i first sat in a cts at the new england auto show a few years back i really felt like i was in a 20k chevy not a gasp 40k caddy   as i said earlier the actual driving is probably since i havent driven one the cts saving grace the exterior while it has grown on me and isnt aztekugly still is too overdone for my tastes how long does it take to settle a lemon law case   thanks have you sat in the g35 back to back with the tl if you do i dont see how you could come to the conclusion the g35 is small but the tl is not they are virtually identical except i hit my head in the rear of the tl and not the g imo with the updated 05 g35 interior you should definitely test drive it with your choices it is fun to test or own any of the cars in this class so enjoy i think a g25 priced about 2500 less than the g35 would be a good idea get more younger buyers in the door who will later upgrade to more expensive infinitis   all the other import luxury brands offer or will offer a base version offering about 200 hp i see no reason why infiniti should not   audi a4 18 bmw 325i mercedes c240 lexus is250 coming soon acura tsx   they could use the v6 vq25de used in the japanese fuga us m 250gt making 210hp at 6000rpm and 197 torque at 4400rpm   obviously it wont feel as powerful as the g35 but it will have a lighter steering feel better balance and be more gas efficient as well   itll probably do 060 in about 70 seconds with auto trans which wont be that bad i did sit in the g35 and the tl back to back maybe i mistyped but i think that the headroom in the tl is probably an inch or so more than the g35 i dont necessarily think that the interior is that much different i am only 61 but i do prefer the upright position and my headhair was rubbing on the roof of the g35 but not on the roof of the tl or the s60 for that matter they are all fun you are right i have paralysis by analysis done too much research i should just not look at any stats and get the one that makes me feel good i guess try real snow tires 4 of them narrow is better of course keeping same overall diameter and fitting over brake package use smaller wheel minus 1 sizing i cant believe people dont use snow tires all season are stated as for occassional light snow by tire specialist such as tire rack a set of snows on different wheels are the way to go and stop better period i agree that full snows are the ultimate solution but tirerack is in business to sell tires and would like to convince you that your allseasons will not do the job so far this year my area near detroit has had much more snow than in the previous 5 or 6 years and i have been doing just fine in my 325i rwd with allseasons and thats with my local govt having a budget problem so that it takes them several days to get around to plowing my subdivisions streets the traction and stability controls help a lot but in general i am very pleased with the way this car gets through the snow not quite as good as my previous a4 quattro of course but certainly adequate for this area good point what some people who are not from the midwest dont realize is the topography changes dramatically once you get north of i70 basically an eastwest line that goes through indianapolis and columbus   south of that line the topography is very hilly and even though this area gets less snow it is much more difficult to navigate slick areas north of that line most of the area is flat as a billiard table and unless the snow is drifting it really isnt that hard to navigate   there are lots of exceptions but i hope this helps explain why people in detroit or chicago might not need snows but people in cincinnati might require them   regards kyfdx i grew up and learned to drive in oakland county just north of detroit and lived in chicago for 13 years after a 5 year stint in socal and i would have to say that i dont think i would opt for winter tires if my car already had allseason rubber on it if i lived in the midwest the issue gets a little murkier if the car has summer tires for me id get the snows   ive spent the last dozen years on the east coast and given the hilly nature of the local topology winter tires become even more important i survived with allseason rubber in the nyc metro area however there were a number of days where i needed to be on the roads and those tires made for a serious white knuckle trip the winter tires im currently running have made such a dramatic transformation in the drivability of my car that i doubt seriously if ill ever not opt for winter tires again   best regards shipo greetings from the land of the newest dynasty new england   ultimately you are correct however as a lifelong new englander and skier vermont primarily but now that im in boston maine and new hampster too ive always done just fine with frontwheel drive allseason tires and a bit of winter driving common sense this is one reason ive stuck with fwd and never felt the need for awd thats why im so disappointed with the bridgestones performance in the snow i may need to buy snow tires if i knew i was going to need snows i may have gone rwd   the tcsvsa  abs have kept me going in the desired direction so im not going to spring for snows or better rated in the snow all seasons yet see how i do the rest of this winter 02 from the big apple i was actually out in columbus oh just after christmas and had no problems with the rsas even in water on top of ice g35x back here in nyc i had no real problems in our recent blizzard the only time i was wishing for winter tires was when i was trying to park or leave my parking space i just turned on snow mode and turned off the vdc a lot of rocking back and forth was required   i realize that allseason tires are at best a compromise the awd is best for getting going and helps in turns but awd doesnt do anything for stopping in the snow   i wish that the infiniti wheels were not so expensive as i would have a dedicated set of winter tires in the original size id prefer pirelli sotto zero or dunlops as i feel that they would last longer than blizzaks too bad nokkia or gislaved dont make winter tires in this size has anyone compared the cts to the lincoln ls or the pontiac gxp comments i was actually just mentioning this to my wife last night  that i need to go drive the cts and ls however id be looking at used since both of these depreciate harshly ive seen 03s and 04s with low miles of both cars for 25k to 28k and thats list price a reporter would like to interview someone who recently bought a large sedan such as a mercedes eclass lexus ls 430 mercury crown victoria or any large cadillac or lincoln   please send your daytime contact info to jfallonedmundscom by friday february 11 2005 im in the market for a new vehicle and am comparing these 3 vehicles because of their power and fun factor it seems the tl gets the best gas mileage while the g35 has an all wheel drive option not with a stick  and the subaru has awd with a stick all have tons of power and are in the 3033k range id love to hear from people who have these vehicles i test drove just about everything in this class 330ic230 lexus i  e etc but the subaru i have owned european cars in the past for me it came down to the tl and the g35 the tl has a nicer interior overall and a kick nonpermissible content removed stereo i found that the g35 had more lateral space in the back just for your info in my humble opinion the g35 is a superior performance car than the tl it corners better and has a higher pick up rate the big draw back of the tl for me was the fwd it just couldnt match the cornering of the g35 ohdid i mention the acceleration rate of the g35 if you want the overall luxury and some performance go with the tl if you want some luxury but alot of fun factor the g35 is the way to go i recommend the sports suspension pkg too make sure that when you test drive these cars that you max perform them good luck and have fun thanks for the insight the g35 is a great car the problem i have reading up on the g35 is gas mileage it seems to get aroud 1518 mpg versus 2528 mpg for the tl i wonder where the subaru would come in at gas mileage i have heard the turbo can get close to 25 mpg on the highway and thats a 250 hp engine the real world gas mileage difference between the g and the tl isnt nearly that much the tl gets about 22 mpg on average and the g gets about 20 mpg ive averaged 195 in my 03 g35 over 35k miles probably aroudn 70 city the subaru is worse than the g35 according to consumer reports by about 2 mpg i havent driven the subaru but i know that of those 3 the acura tl has a much nicer interior the g35 has a metal face covering the center controls radioacetc and it looks really tacky fake and cheap my inlaws have one and complain that the metal scratches pretty easily too id think the tl would be the slowest offtheline bc of the lowend torque but frankly its plentyfast for me with the manual the clutch engages really early so that might help not sure overall theyre all fast since i dont live near an autobahntype road the tl was the clear winner bc of the luxury features tl also got the best crashtest ratings and i think consumer reports ranks it higher than the others as an aside if you are even just considering navigation go with the acura and get it the system is amazing  totally integrated with ac and radio so you can do a lot wo taking your eyes off the road or hands off the wheel plus if you know the phone number of your destination you can program a route without your hands leaving the wheel you can also use it instead of calling info  type in the store you want and its name address and phone  come up so you can call them its fantastic one of those things you dont realize how neat it is until you have it this may sound like a weird question and i am not asking for myself but is there any car in this classification that does not require premium grade gasoline i dont think any of these car require premium gas they all have computer controlled timing and will run just fine on 87 youll simply lose some horsepower and economy in my opinion its just not worth sacrificing performance to save a mere 250 a tankfull pretty sure the answer is no unfortunately the 93 linear uses regular gas its not particularly potent either but still more\\nthan an a4 18t dave the cts runs on 87 octane dear sylvia with automobile magazine recently rating the subaru legacy gt as the best family sedan also road  track picking the legacy gt over the acura tsx can there be some reconsideration of adding the subaru legacy gt to this discussion the size is about equal to the tl or the g35 the performance of the legacy gt is equal or better safety measures  crash tests findings are equal quality fit  finish  interior materials are equal imho that is subjective i understand but they are much better than the last generation\\ni think it warrants new consideration the only thing missing is the nav and the new 2006 will have that stability control is not available on the legacy and i dont think the interior is quite equal to the other two on balance though its a good buy and a couple thou cheaper than the tl or g plus you get awd geez dude just let it die its not entry level luxury been discussed a billion times why do you care the legacy gt is not considered to be an entrylevel luxury sedan which is why it is not included here you are welcome to fire up another comparo of any set of vehicles that we arent already comparing and that you think is viable click on the comparisons  sedans vs sedans link at the top and bottom of the page to check out the comparos which are already underway thats also where you would create a new discussion if that seems to be the best thing to do by the way im the host not sylvia by the way im the host not sylvia  more like the hostess with the mostess  best regards\\nshipo from january to november 2004 i drove and owned a acura tl without a doubt it was the best car ive ever owned it comes standard with everything transmission and nav are your only options i have also owned bmw 330xi03 lexus is30001 infinity 3 maximas buick riviera and a number of other quality cars in 50 years of driving last week i test drove a 36 cts and was knocked outwhat a car far more punch than the tl with rwd more torque smaller turning radiuspowereful nimble and refined yesterday 22505 i took delivery of my new cts from a dealer about 25 miles from ny homei was grinning all the way home hopefully ill still be grinning a year from now we will see from january to november 2004 i drove and owned a acura tl why did you own a tl for only 11 months after driving a legacy gt limited the other day id expect around 18 mpg total and no more than 21 on the freeway why the gearing is not very conducive to getting decent mileage i was running near 4k rpm at only 75 mph the car needs an actual freeway gear  something bmw and acura do and thus they get high freeway mileage on another note drove the 2005 g35 manual sedan improvements to the interior are evident immediately wow nice aluminum trim everywhere electronic tilttelescope if it were bmw id expect that would break after 23 years seats are wide lazboy like shifter feels smoother and shorter than that 2003 manual i drove engines got crazy power  pulls like a damn rocket sled car still feels lumbering and not very agile even with optional 18s you sit far too high up so the feeling of speed is more apparent than in the bmw and it ends up making the car feel more like a souped up decent handling buick with that big interior and so much metal everywhere fun car for 32k or so but still think id opt for a used bimmer before getting a g35 it still doesnt feel like a legit sport sedan more a fast sporty sedan and that engine while powerful just is too rough when pushed it sounds like it might break above 5k rpm no redline on the tach but an annoying light starts to blink at 35004k telling me to shift dumb design and it makes it impossible to tell the cars real redline it was only 10 months i fully realize that i have a problem call it ncl some guys have a problem with gambling some with booze some with women i have nclnew car lust a lexus dealer told me that there are plenty of people with similiar problems ex buying a convertable in the spring and trading it in the fall for a sedan i am nowhere near that point hope to keep cts for 3 years i have a wife who goes along it is called ccb chronic car buying we even have a forum for it here in town hall would be interested to hear your take on the legacy gt i found it to have a sloppy suspension also since you put 147used148 and 147redline148 into your

sedans  subaru legacy gt vs others 35 1 mar 2005 1202 pm it got yanked yesterday because i used an acronym that is looked down upon here as for the s2000 intriguing but not really worth it as the performance from that engine is only marginally better than my 330i perf pack and the cars not really useful boxster  not to my liking in any way shape or form  basically its just heinous 911s sweet but not my bag either too much like a middle aged mans vette in my eyes pretty impractical too if i were to get a modder beater itd be a miata and then id turbo it hey see the new is bland but stylings pretty unimportant to me but the possibility of the 35 with 300 hp rwd lower driving position and lexus reliability gets my eyebrows up im hoping ive finally found something that can at least run with my e46 and not make pine for it chris nice to see you and no i dont hate the g35 far from it excellent car that isnt quite there regarding seating lowering the seat would only make me like im sitting in a hole and it wont change the fact the car is so damn high as for handling  please tell me youll drive the sport model next time no one complains in fact the 03 had 9 skidpad and 67 slalom or 665 maybe cant remember  not exactly lumbering drove a g35 manual 05 which comes with the 18s afaik the manuals come with the sport suspension automatically if im wrong please correct me i believe im right though remember i wanted to buy an 03 for a car the runs with  and not behind the 3 with zhp pack  sporty sedan is just plain wrong you must have been owned by a g some time ago and have a bad thing for them now youve been trshing them for over a year while the rest of the automotvie community respects that there is a new benchmark until 06 at least owned how i dont race people i was owned by a g35 03 on a test drive  the car lifted up in the rear on a turn unsettling to say the least imho and its just my opinion thought other seem to agree the g35 does not feel as centered or planted on the tarmac as the 330i zhp trust me i wanted to buy an 03 and i desperately wanted to love the 05 g35 but the cars handling and engine just didnt match my expectations for a car in this class i would love to be in a reliable fast competent japanese sports sedan not to mention cheap but i cant find one and the 06 330 swill seem sluggish compared to a 298hp g for sure and that crappy handling will be just enough to match anything the 3 haswith more legroom uh i havent touched the 06 3 so i wont comment on the performance though i will say i think the body is ugly interior bland and the size increase totally unwarranted the e46 was already too porky not just in weight but also size so the e90 will get a coutesy test drive when i replace my car but i have very low expectations for the car and for bmw in general btw my 330i with its measely 235 hp still pulls perfectly and with no fanfare compared to my experience in the 05 g35 the inline 6 in my zhp may not be my favorite engine but god its so smooth it makes me wonder how subaru and infiniti even try to compete with those engines the racket in the highend is insane actually the 06 is300 with 252 is on my shortlist i dont care for the exterior or interior but it may have the traits i desire  great handling rwd not a fan or awd or fwd low seating position no matter how low you make the seat in a g the car still rides high bulletproof reliability and of course a decent price im anything but brand loyal the guys at bimmerfest will atest to how i go rounds regarding my 330i and lousy bmw buid quality  also posted this on the infiniti g35 sedan and fx35 boards hi everyone this is my first post on this board to give you a little background i currently own a mazda mx6 and my wife drives an acura mdx we have a 14 month baby girl and it is getting very difficult for me to get her in and out of the car seat if i have to pick her up so im in the market for a new vehicle i had wanted to stay with a manual transmission  i dont have traffic in my commute and prefer the fun and feel of a manual transmission anyway i had narrowed the choice down to the acura tl 6mt and the infiniti g35 sedan with 6mt after weighing all of the pros and cons i decided to go with the g35 then came the baby car seat test in which the g35 did not do well the tl has a latch position in the center so you can place a rearfacing car seat in the middle and still have room for 2 adults on the outside positions the g35 does not have this i then tried to put the rearfacing car seat behind the drivers seat and the passengers seat even with the seats adjusted to my short 58 frame i found that i had to move the seats too far forward in the g35 the acura was a tiny bit better in this regard since my heart was set on the g35 i was very disappointed in this we only have one child now but hope to have a second one in the future meaning that we will probably have both a forward facing toddler seat and a rear facing infant seat in the back so i really need a vehicle that can accomodate both this brings me to small suvs i test drove both the infiniti fx35 and the lexus rx330 the lexus is more practical but i really prefer the looks and sporty feel of the fx35 i preferred the control and feel of the fx35 sport suspension with the 20 wheels even though the ride was a tad harsher i live in dallas and a rwd car with big wheels will rarely have weather issues to contend with i would appreciate any advice especially with regards to the baby car seats that would help me make my decision if there are any parents of young children out there that have faced a similar problem recently i would appreciate your input i have checked out the infiniti snugkids website but it does not say anything about how to put a car seat in the center position one thought is to go with the my first choice the g35 the problems with the infant car seat will only be for the first couple of years after which the baby will be in a forwardfacing car seat that the g35 can easily accomodate do i rule out my 1 choice just because of a car seat like i said i was very disappointed when the g35 did not do well with the car seats im beginning to think that all midsize sedans will have this problem sorry for the long email thanks seldom does this subject come up on these boardsits usually discussed in the minivan threads my 3 kids are now 8 6 and 3 so im just a few years beyond you we own an odyssey and just bought an 05 tl 6mt one key for us was enough width across the back seat for the 3 kids 2 of them in booster seats narrowed to nissan maxima slightly more room and tl because we felt most of the other contenders in this category would be too small so far were very pleased with our choice getting the kids in and out of the back is not as easy as in the van but still not a problem btw they love the dvd surround sound in the acura and fight over who gets next i didnt drive the infinity dt the perception it wasnt quite as big as the other 2 in the end my advice is to figure out the way to get the best combination of practical kids and fun mom and dad hope this helps 1st i agree with wisngamecock that the tl  nissan maxima would probably do better with car seats than the g35 or vw passat bc of size the maxima is bigger than the tl but you lose some handling more importantly though im concerned about your comment as follows the tl has a latch position in the center so you can place a rearfacing car seat in the middle and still have room for 2 adults on the outside positions i have an 04 tl and use a car seat as i did with my prior 20015 passat and i dont think there is a center latch set in the acura please please please count the number of latches i believe youll find 4 and even though it is possible to attach the seat in the middle youll be doing so using the inside passengerside latch and the inside driverside latch latches are not tested this way they are intended to have pressure applied to the same set of latches so please make sure you find a car with 6 latches in the back if you want to latch in the center ljwalters1  thanks for the comment about the number of latches i was looking at the 05 tl and i am pretty sure there are 3 pairs of latches in the back but i will reach in the back seat and count again i should find a total of 6 latch connections if not then there goes the idea of placing the car seat in the middle i was fortunate enough to drive a 2005 g35 6mt for a few days and it was so interesting to me how i walked away from it i was very strongly considering buying the car as a replacement to my 2003 330i as it is bigger and a little more family friendly here is my opinion 1 i know the g35 is faster on paper but it sure does not feel faster i guess it has to do with the overall size of the car but the bmw simply felt like it had more pop 2 i do admit the g has the bimmer beat in some areas back seat stereo and you can even argue it has a more modern look 3 but i am here to tell you that everything people say about bmws is absolutely correct the biggest difference for me was behind the wheel and the connection you have with your surroundings and the road it is truly amazing to me so in conclusion i decided to stay in my 2003 330i and wait to see the 06 3series the funniest thing to me was i walked away thinking that it is either a bmw or it is not and i will look again in time at the g35 and the new lexus is but in the end i believe that if i do not get a bmw i am going to load up a honda accord and be mr family guy really whats the difference because if you want the best get it sports sedanbmw family sedan  honda eom i know the g35 is faster on paper but it sure does not feel faster i guess it has to do with the overall size of the car but the bmw simply felt like it had more pop when i drove the two cars back to back auto the g definitely felt faster and that was with the 260hp 2003 g35 the 280hp 2005 g35 should be even faster the g is simply a bigger sedan than the 3 that alone works against it in terms of handling i am on the fence i live in chicago weather and all and am considering the rwd g35 could someone tell me how it truly performs on wetsnowy climates it would be appreciated the dealer told me its great in snow but i dont believe him i would consider the g35x but the mileage issue and that its just another thing to go wrong w the car has me concerned the acura tl is my other option but i am totally infatuated w the look and feel of the g35 thanks i have the same dilemma but have even more snow than you we got 12 tueswed in south bend when chicago got maybe 1 ive read opinions here varying from ok to lousy dont even think about summer tires in the winter seems to me that rwd with tcs shouldnt be any worse than fwd wo tcs which dealer are you working with an infiniti dealership in libertyville il my insurance agent has one and she said its very light in the back and recommended snow tires just not sure i want to spend that kind of money and deal w the hassle every year thanks for your comments otoh 20 years ago we were all driving rwd cars and seemed to manage even without traction control there was no such a thing as summer performance tires for the average sedan either if you live in the snow belt and buy a car with performance tires do yourself a favor buy a set of winter tires best regards\\nshipo if you can still find one and if youre willing to give up a sporty driving experience you could try the infiniti i35 i drive one and it seems more family friendly and cheaper than the g35 sure its a little dated and its essentially a maxima with a different badge but most dealers will be trying to unload their leftover 2004 inventory the i35 also seems to have the most space in the entire entry level luxury class and i feel that its a pretty good value warning you may have problems finding one equipped the way you liked i wanted the navigation system and the nearest dealer that had one was in atlanta and i wasnt willing to travel that far i compromised and bought a base model get winter tires all around and youll be fine  assuming you have a clue in the first place how to drive in snow ive driven a 65 mgb through two winters in edmonton followed by a 73 240z for three more winters tires  common sense trump frontwheel drive all day long awd is pretty hard to beat but the rest of the year you get to drag around more weight and all where you dont want it youre very welcome btw because of this stream i rechecked my 04 tl and theres definitely only 2 sets of latches itd be nice if their was a middle set but i dont know if the backseets wide enough for that ps  putting the carseat behind the passenger seat is better than the middle for ease of getting the baby inout and with rearfacing seats its easier for my hand to touch my baby  the middle position is actually too close for me i find the middle position is only nice 1 if therell be 2 small people sitting in the back too or 2 on long trips when the baby can better enjoy looking out the front window with a frontfacing seat or 3 therell be someone in the front passenger seat and the middle position is easier for them im just replying to 1 part of your post  seems to me that rwd with tcs shouldnt be any worse than fwd wo tcs i wouldnt be so sure of that a fwd car gets better traction bc the engine sits over the wheels that drive and that weight provides increased traction  probably due to increased friction with the road dont know if there are studies on that tcs does not increase traction  it just makes the best use of whatever traction is there by increasing the drive power of whichever wheel has traction it cant create traction which the fwd car does bc of the engine placement i would thing a fwd car would generally be better than rwd w tcs well are you talking about acceleration or handling eg not skidding in incliment conditions currently i have a rwd w tcs and stability a fwd wout tcs and an awd wout tcs the rwd is still the worst of all my cars in poor road conditions have you tried winter tires i would have agreed with you until i bought a set for my current rwd car those tires michelin arcticalpins have transformed my car from the worst winter driver to the best i have ever had would an awd equipped car shod with winter tires perform even better in acceleration almost certainly however given that my car is still more than capable until the snow rises above the door sills i dont see any advantage to awd considering the handling and braking disadvantages that come with the extra weight of the additional drivetrain hardware best regards\\nshipo kd i know you and i have had some heated discussions in the past about bmw and acura\\nbut in all honesty this car is the only car that has out right left me and my tls in the dust\\nso i crossed enemy lines on saturday just to get a taste of what this car feels like i went to the local bmw dealer and test the 545 with the sport package\\ni was blown away this car is fast and i mean fast on every aspect of the revband\\nit was surprising to me that the dealer let me go on the test drive all by myselfi went there back in 99 when i was cross shopping the 3 tl and the millennia and they wanted to put a traking device on the car anyway i think it is out of my price range but who knows in few years i might buy one used no argument from me i personally love acuras and think the tl is a lot of car for the money it just isnt for me i love the 545i also not even close to being an option for me due to finances fuel mileage desire to keep eating etc if i had 50k60k to spend though i think id still pick the 530i and eat at a five star restaurant once per month  im guessing for most people that buy the 545i that isnt an eitheror decision i dont know why that would matter traction is traction whether its off the line cruising or in a turn unless you want to work torque steer into the equation im not a physicist so im afraid weve reached the limits of my thinking traction is traction whether its off the line cruising or in a turn well no not really static weight distribution ie frontrear weight bias and driving dynamics play a substantial part in winter driving as well three examples assuming two otherwise identical fwd and rwd cars driving in snowy conditions acceleration under light acceleration ie very little front to rear weight transfer the fwd car with its 6040 weight distribution will have more traction than the rwd car with its 5050 weight distribution however under stronger acceleration since weight transfers to the rear in such a situation the front tires will lose traction whereas the rwd car will gain traction around a curve the lighter back end of the fwd car will come unglued before the heavier front end of the car under some circumstances while in others accelerating through a curve for instance since the front tires are being asked to do double duty accelerating and turning they will break loose and plow before the back end a rwd car with a good traction control system will be less prone to either of those two scenarios braking the fwd car which already has a significant front end bias will load up even more with the weight transfer of braking allowing the back end to become very light and lose traction and without the aid of tcs could very well find said back end leading the front end down the road the rwd car given its better balance will be less susceptible to that situation as well best regards\\nshipo no i havent tried winter tires but to answer your second question i have to extrapolate that since my rwd car has the worst traction while none of my cars have winter tires it would still have the worst traction if all of my cars had winter tires it may no longer be dangerous but it would still suffer by comparison regardless i just dont want to spend the money and time at this point to buy special tires and change them depending on the weather i kept my fwd car so that i can leave the rwd car at home when necessary now lets keep in mind that not all tractionstability systems are created equal i found the system in the benz to be far more capable and far more transparent than the system in my 350z im confident that good tires on the benz with that system would be much more suited to adverse weather than my z with even some of the best tires fair enough i must say that the tcs system on my 530i is quite impressive and coupled with the additional winter tires i ordered the sport package which includes summer tires my car has gone from completely undrivable in anything more than a dusting of snow to being able to easily plow through six inches as quickly as if not quicker than the ubiquitous suvs that many here in southern new hamster drive given that we are in the midst of our second one hundred inch or more winter in the last three seasons ive had ample opportunity to drive with four to six inches on the roads best regards\\nshipo regardless i just dont want to spend the money and time at this point to buy special tires and change them depending on the weather i kept my fwd car so that i can leave the rwd car at home when necessary winter tires are a marginal expense  your summer tires will last longer because they are resting 12 the year  its a lot cheaper than buyingmaintaininginsuring two cars i dont understand this incredible aversion so many people have to winter tires if you live in a snowy area its a better safety investment than fwd awd airbags stability control and all the other things car companies have convinced us to spend money on dave i agree with your assessment and suggest another alternative move to florida like me i agree with your assessment and suggest another alternative move to florida like me no thanks its way too hot and humid for my liking in previous lives ive domiciled in california texas georgia and virginia and i had to move back up north for my health and sanity  best regards\\nshipo i hear what youre saying but in my case i didnt buy another car i just didnt sell one besides not only am i saving the miles on my summer tires on the z but im saving miles off the entire car by driving a different one altogether maintenance costs nothing extra because the miles are split between the cars so im still doing maintenance at the same pace if you count performing it half as much on twice the cars insurance eh not enough to worry about 40 a month is worth it for me especially when you figure in the added bonus of being able to keep a 2seat sportscar on hand while still having the 4seat sedan for familial duties whereas many many people sacrifice the sportscar because they had a baby or whatever edit  oh and a whole other set of tires and wheels would cost me probably nearly the same as 2 years of insurance on that 2nd car notice i mentioned time and money obviously money isnt the big issue with me time and something else i forgot  garage storage space for those extra wheelstires is anyway  were really way off topic oh the car i wound up not selling when i got my z is my entry level performance sedan 40 a month for insurance  480 a year equal to a set of snows swapping takes maybe an hour a year depreciation and maintainance are partially time based as well now you dont have to justify wanting to have a extra 2 seat sports car to me though after all were not all driving 1000 old beaters i guess i cant post a link but its in the auto technology section they compared similar size fwd to rwd cars one was the g35 in wet and dry acceleration and slalomlane change with and without tcs on their conclusion was neither frontwheel drive nor rearwheel drive is really better than the other in my relatively snowy area 68 this season so far im leaning towards the tl or tsx over the g35 because of the fwd and arguably nicer interiors um theres no reason why you cant post a link to popular mechanics technology section unless it is a paid subscription area that would be okay too just explain that in your post are you concerned about our no links to other automotive message boards deal any article on popular mechanics  or anywhere as long as it is not directly into another automotive forum  should be fine take a look at our rules of the road linked at the top of the page they should answer any question you might have about what can be linked and what cannot but if you have further questions feel free to drop me an email that may cover the tires but what about the wheels they need to be mounted on i dont have a tire machine in my garage unfortunately so they need to be mounted on their own wheels yes winters steel wheels hubcaps 500 or so slightly more for alloys that will last you for a few seasons bmws are much more economical to lease because of 1 subsidized interest rates and 2 very high residuals since my rwd car has the worst traction while none of my cars have winter tires it would still have the worst traction if all of my cars had winter tires they would essentially be the same the part of the car that actually touches the road is the tire winter tires are better in the winter than all seasons or summer tires you would rather keep 2 cars than spend 500 for tires whatever bmws are much more economical to lease because of 1 subsidized interest rates hmmm that smacks of an urban legend as it has been repeated so often that most folks believe it without thinking about it as a counterpoint to that statement i have leased two bmws and in both cases i was quoted a lower monthly lease price from an non bmwfs leasing outfit the only reason i lease my second bmw through bmwfs is because i did the european delivery thing and it was just easier to arrange as for and 2 very high residuals im thinking that that statement is the truth of the matter best regards\\nshipo the last car i leased was a mazda millennia and i enjoyed every bit of it\\npersonally i dont want to go down that road again leasing i would rather buy a car like the 545\\ni am getting rid of my tls next summer so it depends on how i get for it when i sell it myself\\ni am just going to play the waitng game to see all the new goodies and upgrades next year im pretty happy with my 330i lease i pay 485 a month on a car with an msrp of 43k 15k miles3 years shrug no need to be a hater what kind of car guy doesnt want more than one car in their stable heck ive got 3 not including my wifes by the way my fwd has been absolutely unstoppable in the snow with a good set of allseasons on it no need for swapping on you lease of the 330i what did you put down i got the msds  which i get back at the end so in terms of cash that is gone forever from my pocket i think it was something like 750 or 1000 but that was titling and the first months payment too when i figured out the dollars i will be out to bmw in may of 06 it was 18k total 6k a year to play with a car isnt bad the residual on the car is 25k 59 residualas if it will be worth that much in 06 my mf factor was like 00007 the following is from a lexus dealer rep whos been reliable in the past in october 2005\\n06 is250 and is350 the is250 will have a 6 speed manual tranny or a automatic v6 engine the is250 will have 220 horsepower the is350 is a v6 automatic only but will have guarranteed minimum of 325 horsies the is350 will have an available sport package with 18 wheels pricing will remain competitive and the is will start around 32k33k same as what we have now but a top of the line will be about 45k in march 2006\\n07 es350 will have a 35 liter engine with a completely new body style the only thing they are keeping the same on the es will be the headlight design in april 2006\\n07 rx350 will have the same updated engine as the es in may 2006\\ngs450hybrid will have a v6 hybrid engine but be faster than the gs430 in september 2006\\nls460hybrid with 2 body styles one 6 inches longer will be added to the regular ls both will have 46 v8 engines in september 2006\\n07gs350 will have the updated engine but same body style in september 2006\\n07 gs460 will have an updated engine in 23 more years the is convertible with retractable hard top is coming for cetain and other car ideas that are being tossed around also are the super ls that will cost more than 100k and the supercoupe that will go 200 mph  also it seems that toyota is going to use the 35 gr v6 in much the same fashion that nissan uses the 35 vq v6 meaning that a lot toyotaslexuses will have it no doubt the next camry solara sienna and highlander will carry the 35 gr as well an automatic only is350 yuck regardless of its other fine attributes i wont even bother looking at it  best regards\\nshipo they got crucified for not having a manual when the is300 showed up theres no way they wouldnt learn their lesson sorry but i think the dealer is off if hes not lexus just blew its chance at dethroning the 330 god what a bummer have a great engine and the car would be utterly worthless to drive i leased a 330xi in jan 03 416 per month after putting 5 k down a great car in most respects last month i leased an 05 cts with 36 engine1 k down  322 per month both leases were 36 month term bmw was 10k miles percad 12k miles per\\ncts cost 7500 less to lease for 3 years\\ncts is much faster than 330  runs on regular gas cts lacks awd and heated seats i can do without before you respond to this post and point out that bmw is the gold standard of sports sedans and i am clearly an uninformed moron please test drive 36 cts it is smooth  powerful nimble  quicka blast to drive errr sorry been there done that got the teeshirt cts no thanks would i believe that a cts 36 can out drive a 330xi yup not a fair comparison does my butt dyno tell me that a cts 36 will out drive a 330i sp much less a zhp nope then there is the whole looks thing to my eye the cts has a face that only a mother could love 330i dethroned not yet best regards\\nshipo exactly hope this is incorrect information or if its not that toyota reconsiders they got crucified for not having a manual when the is300 showed up yes but once they finally released the 5speed it was a runaway success that would be an unforgivable mistake if they only offer the automatic version\\ni will definitely ignore the is wo a manual\\ngranny tranny on a sports sedan no thank you if lexus is serious about going after bmw crowd\\nthey need to offer a full range of manual transmissions on their cars gs is even sc need to have a manual optionhaving just one model measly 25l is unacceptable please test drive 36 cts it is smooth  powerful nimble  quicka blast to drive done it didnt like it didnt find it nimble in any sense found it flaccidv my zhp yes but once they finally released the 5speed it was a runaway success runaway success that term cannot be used with the is300 which was always a sales disappointment there should be some way for all of us to make it clear when were being sarcastic in text dave youre right dave maybe i should have used tfic tongue firmly in cheek my bad its hard to discern sarcasm sometimes from weird badge loving that said im getting rid of my 330i for a mitsu eclipse spyder with an auto mitsu may build the best cars in the world yikes i can hear the headlines now from zhp to mitsu spyder is blueguy going through a midlife crisis in reverse the world wants to know  best regards\\nshipo i try to assume people are being sarcastic when they say something i think is really dumb its more comforting sometimes i try to assume people are being sarcastic when they say something i think is really dumb its more comforting sometimes you made my day with that rofl i try to assume people are being sarcastic when they say something i think is really dumb its more comforting sometimes  i will have to try that\\nthanks\\n ray\\nsometimes reacting when should not    as someone who has spent his career in and around the auto industry i can tell you with a bit of authority that the future of manual transmissions as we know and love them may be limited and yes even the europeans will have to get used to it one big reason is that in search of better economy emissions and performance the trend is toward more gears even the latest automatics now have 6 speeds however the consensus is that 6 speeds is the practical limit for a manual levershifted transmission think about trying to negotiate the gates quickly with a theoretical 7speed shifter and youll see what i mean  but this does not mean a future of driving slushboxes there is already a trend toward the sequentialshift transmissions that bmw calls smg and i forget what audi calls theirs internally these are fully manual type gearboxes with mechanical clutches but theyre shifted electronically under servo control and dont have a clutch pedal to me these seem to be the worst of both worlds but unfortunately thats what were headed for a few years down the road so enjoy using your clutch pedal while you can i know i will gordon i agree with everything you said but i dont think the situation is all that critical just yet the days of pining for a stick are a long ways off in the long run you are correct but the good news is that were all dead in the long run so no problem as long as theres a demand therell be someone offering it i think the worstcase scenario is that the old fashioned manual will become an extra cost option as long as there are people willing to pay for it there will be people willing to sell it its up to us to keep the manual alive by evangelizing it to the point of annoyance its funny im a definite manual guy  just love shifting through the gears on my own i dont laim to be the best at it in fact id bet i could accelerate faster in a 4 spd automatic than a 5 or 6 spd manual just bc of my own limitations the manual is still just more fun and makes driving more interesting itd be a shame to see it go definitely bad ideajust read the review of a z4 smg in last month cardriver 100 of people testing it hated it the art yes art of driving a manualequipped car is disappearingand yes it is up to us to keep it alive thats why i admire bmw although i loathe their prices for offering manual trannies in most of their cars lexus needs to do the same as well as mercedes\\ni would gladly buy an e350 with a manual hi my name is shipo and im a manual transmission addict group hi shipo i came before you today to say that after ten consecutive manual transmission equipped cars spanning a period of 26 years i will be stick free in twelve days big burley construction worker to my right there there we are here to help you get through your period of adjustment remember just take it one day at a time thanks folks its going to be a rough time as due to factors beyond my control i wont be able to reacquire another car with three pedals until april of 2006 group moderator do you mean to say that youve come to us for help to just temporarily drive without a stick shift and that you are actively planning on getting another one yes that is correct group moderator you do realize that we here at automatics only anonymous are dedicated to helping you rid yourself of the stick shift habit forever trembling in my seat sweat pouring down my face ummm yes but i neeeeed it group moderator mr shipo please get control of your self you need to understand that we will only help you if you are truly committed to the extinction of the manual transmission but what about my 11 year old son he cant wait for me to teach him how to use a clutch group moderator what you are actually planning on passing that horrible addiction along to your son yes sir group moderator long sigh mr shipo im going to have to ask you to leave now group bye shipo goodbye gang and thanks i feel better already best regards\\nshipo hahaha love my

know what it would be like my suspicion though is that it would be a poor substitute for the real thing too much time on your hands shipo billherrmann if you had actually read my post you would see that i explained why it wasnt a fair comparison your former 330xi is a car that is running around with awd hardware and said hardware is both heavy and has a certain amount of mechanical drag associated with it that makes the 330xi significantly slower and less responsive than a like equipped 330i the cts 36 has a rwd drive train which like the 330i is much more efficient so no it wasnt a fair comparison to make it fair you would need to compare it to a rwd 330i as if the awd components werent enough of a handicap the 330xi only comes equipped with relatively skinny allseason tires which are not at all conducive to good handling imho it isn146t even fair to compare a 330i sp to a 330xi they just aint the same since the lease is up on my 530i sp in a couple of weeks and since i am going to hold off from getting a new car for a year or so ive been taking the time to test drive virtually every thing out there including a cts 36 automatic no dealership around here stocks cars with manual transmissions assuming of course that you can even order one these days it was quick however not as quick as my 530i 5speed which by the way is no match for a 330i 6speed as for handling sorry the cts felt like a land barge compared to my 530i which once again isnt in the same league as a 330i sp regarding trunk space who cares we are talking performance sedans here and like it or not trunk space is not something high on the priority list of most folks shopping for this type if car will the 330i hold three bags of golf clubs yes good enough regarding the pricing numbers youve been throwing around me thinks youre playing it a little loose i configured both cars as follows which is how i would order them were i going to do so today cadillac cts luxury sport 41385\\nbmw 330i pp sp xenon heated front seats 40995 the only option that the cts has that the 330i doesnt have is the ugo which is an after market accessory costing 145 in the end those two cars are as apples to apples as it gets and the bmw costs a whopping 245 less sorry i cannot get too excited about the price difference what i can get excited about is the difference in how they drive note not just how they accelerate and in that comparison the cadillac finished a very distant second enjoy your cts best regards\\nshipo lol made my day shipo if you need any support during your time in the wilderness were all here for you ive been driving for 25 years and ive only owned 5 cars i tend to be clingy i guess and yep everyone of them had a manual tranny im not sure id know how to drive an auto as an friend once told me i cant drive an auto id get bored and fall asleep at the wheel remember its not an addiction its a lifestyle choice shipo if you had actually read my last post you would realize that i

to the accuracy of the edmunds numbers best regards\\nshipo i wouldnt trust edmunds on any of their figures or go to carsdirect  they actually sell cars edmunds is always off in my experienceand ive helped about 5 people buy cars in the past 23 years i get my pricing from kbb they seem to be more accurate and their software will flag you if you try to add incompatible options i do the same i price cars there and waste my time here are edmunds s generally low or high are you talking about the msrp or list price what about theyre what people are paying s im not being a smartguy  i just usually rely on edmunds s and want some education tends to be wrong on the invoicemsrp pricing what people are paying is i believe data they assemble not sure about its veracity i personally dont care what theyre payingi want to buy the car for the lowest price not walk in hoping to match what everybody else gets if anything lets see the top ten best and top ten worst prices paid there is already a trend toward the sequentialshift transmissions that bmw calls smg in my book if it doesnt have three pedals its an automatic carsdirect shows 38423 with luxury sport package you could probably get 4000k off that later in the year i thought it drove pretty well but it wasnt in the same league as the 530 with the new sport package adaptive suspension dave i do the same i price cars there and waste my time here ha ha thats a good one ill be glad when i finally pull the trigger on a new car probably a month off ill get about 60 min a day of my life back when i back down to a single forum hmmm i tried carsdirect as well and it showed me 34566 for the 330i pp sp heated seats and xenons and 38871 for the cts luxury sport yikes that makes the bmw 4000 less expensive than a comparable cts i assume that this has to do with the fact that the e46 is something of a lame duck as it were with the e90 arriving on our shores in less than two months time best regards\\nshipo the 330 has a 4200 incenive on it now because the new 3series is almost here plus you can grab it near invoice for the same reason makes me sad when i think what i paid for my cpo 328i awhile ago with fewer featuresyuk ha wonderful shipo thanks i approached the topic of maybe the next car will have a manual trans with my wife this week didnt happen didnt even come close am i allowed to say d might try again but your post was perfect im with you brother\\ns blueguy would you purchase that 330i again im currently a tsx owner which i love btw but that darn bimmer intrigues me to no end in the seattle area the bmw is absolutely ubiquitous but i still want to drive and maybe buy one someday what are your thoughts regarding the tsx v 330i i thought id read some of your posts indicating youd driven the tsx thanks for any input in some cases i think i would use edmunds but when i bought my infiniti and yes it has an automatic i took the pricing information from the boards here and walked into the dealer and tried to shoot for the lowest possible price i also brought two ads from dealers in boston and cincinnati and told the dealers that other dealers were willing to sell the car to me for less and this strategy worked because i bought an i35 and many dealers are looking to get rid of their leftover cars from last year johnny i love the tsx i cant quite explain its appeal i love the clean style the nice simple legant cockpit but more importantly i go gaga for the silky smoth 6 speed in those things like buddah ive driven them a few times and i always dug the eager pull of the engine the delight of keeping the car over 4k rpm with plenty of room to play the 330i is a pretty different beast the driving dynamics matched with the power won me over if you feel like your tsx just isnt there for power and if youd like that special punch in corners of rwd then youll enjoy the 330i really the only way youll know go drive one and let the salesguy know its all about the handling in other words dont let him take you on some anemic on surface street then the freeway and back test drive you want twists turns hills switchbacks and plenty of opp to flog the car as god intended yes bmws on the west coast are everywhere you cant swing a dead cat in any west coast major city without hitting a bimmer unfortunate but true  one my reason the tsx attracts me if i hadnt run across a 330i with manual to drive in 03 im sure i woulda ended up in a tsx i woulda been fairly happy too just yearned for more power and awdrwd knowing what i know now about my 330i would i lease againhmmm most likely yes but i gotta say id dwell on it way more i would probably still lease i really wish i could own a bmw but i simply dont think theyre good cars all this talk about the 08 m3 4 door has me excited and conflicted you just cant lease an m3 its a car you buy and keep and the idea of buying a bmw troubles me the idea of owning a lexus infiniti mazda acura doesnt raise my eyebrow in the least autoweek had a preview article this week on the new is350 and compared it to the 06 330i e90 they thought that the is350s styling beat that of the e90 they said it pops while the 330i merely pings or something like that they also estimated a 060 time beating the 330i by a full second since the is350 will have 300hp under the hood in summary they really liked this car and it will be interesting when they get around to actually testing and comparing both in us spec form didnt even test the car so the article is pretty worthless we find out this week if lexus is going to make the same mistake twice  releasing a socalled sports sedan without a manual in the 350 at launch no manual  lexus fumbles again or do all of the latest sport sedansappear bulbous and heavy the tl g35 and cts weigh between 3500 and 3600 lbs the tl has a 108 wheelbase the g35 at 112 and cts at 1135 have some minivans beat in wheelbase imagine how tough a competitor the pontiac aztek would be with the buick rendezvous 36l vvt engine 108 wheelbase 3770 lbs curb weight 245 hp and it sleeps 4 i dont know how much they weigh but i hope the e90 and is250350 come in around 3200 lbs i guess ill keep the tsx and hope someone eventually gets it right how about a 2800 lb bmw 230i roundel this month has the e90 330i without extras at over 3400 lbs the european is250 weighs over 3400 pounds the is350 might be close to 3500 pounds 147is it me or do all of the latest sport sedansappear bulbous and heavy148 indeed they all have porcine characteristics i saw an e23 7series first generation this morning near a current 530 the 7 actually looked smaller and was certainly lower maybe the porsche panamera will bring everyone back to their senses you can bet it will be low slung the way a sport sedan should be however if the engine goes up front it may run into a problem\\x85 i think one of the problems is the new pedestrian safety regs which among other things require a certain amount of clearance between the hood and the engine when the hood height gets raised so does the rest of the car which may account for the slabsidedness we146ve been seeing it certainly appears as if the e90 and new is conform to these regs in addition to the other new generations on the topic of pricings id lilke to run a quote i got by you guys its on a pewter metallic 2005 c320 with the entertainment pkg heated front

httppressroomtoyotacomphoto_librarydisplay_releasehtmlid20050323c well it seems that lexus has gone and done it again no manual transmission in the is350 whats up with that youd think that they would have learned that lesson the last time around do they actually think that the only folks who buy cars with manual transmissions do so because they cannot afford an automatic hence offering it only on the cheapersmaller engined model yikes well i guess that bmw is still safe from this potential 3series beater since this is a car that has a loud bark just no bite best regards\\nshipo jeez its even worse that i thought it appears that the is250 will only be available in two pedal form as well assuming that i interpreted the press release correctly on the other hand i suppose that a new 6speed sequential manual transmission could be sort of like a motorcycle transmission a real clutch pedal and some kind of a simple updown gear shift arrangement hmmm nah that would be too wierd best regards\\nshipo just the awd the rwd 250 comes with sixspeed stick standard see my edited post above to my way of thinking the wording in the press release is kind of ambiguous and as such i dont know how to interpret it best regards\\nshipo yeah i didnt catch that something tells me that copy should have been proofread im guessing a regular old sixspeed i think the copy boy got his sequentials mixed up between the stick and the automatic it is confusing bc they use the qualifyer sequential manual the spec sheet at the bottom clearly indicates manual transmission but i guess there can be different interpretations or definitions of the word manual right mr clinton standard in the is 250 a new 6speed sequential manual transmission is designed to take full advantage of its freerevving v6 engine a new sequentialshift 6speed automatic will also be offered in the is 250 and will be standard in the is 350 and is 250 awd the press release is not clear it says 1476speed sequential manual transmission148 in the text above and 6 mt in the table to me the former means auto clutch sans torque converter such as smg and dsg what is it it is just a plain old manual i guess that wraps it up huh  what is the percentage of manuals sold compared to automatics with sedans i bet it is under 5 in the us 6speed sequential manual transmission is the same wording they use for the mr2 spyders smg like transmission my bet is that you wont be able to buy the new is with a clutch pedal guess they really did want the is to fit in more with the rest of the lexus line this time wouldnt that be a

since the enginetranny are still in good shape but at 190k it wont be long my priorities are manual transmission speed handling safety and decent gas mileage price range is 40k or less and am willing to buy late model used dh says no volvo mb or vw i am willing to give volvo another chance i test drove the 5 series 530 and the 3 series 330xi and 330 last week but there was no manual tranny available was not impressed  the slush box made my volvo at seem great and both cars were rather loud  the 3 series in a good exhaust way the 5 series in a bad road noise way the manual shift option was incredibly slow i will try to test drive again at another dealer for the manual ps idrive stinks was hopeful about the tl but having a hard time getting over the sheer craziness of the navivoice control system and the dash lights were very glaring at night i am not that old and am even some what of a computer geek but someone needs to tell these car companies to stop with all the  junk in the interior so whats left s70\\ntsx\\nmaxima\\ngs\\ncts  well i dont think dh will go for this either\\nwait for mazdaspeed 6\\nwait for new is\\npack the kids in the mini cooper s i did drive this whoa

real low it has two settings one for headlights off one for headlights on there is also a max button that quickly toggles it between the max setting and your setting the dealers set it to the max setting for some reason after reading your post it seems your first priority should be finding out what dh will go for  id look harder for a 3series with a stick big incentives on those right now that will bring the price way down other than that id go with the tsx in addition to the ones you are looking at or waiting for try these nissan altima maxima\\nsubaru legacy gt\\nvolvo s60 r t5\\nif there is an infiniti dealer nearby g35 6mt i dont think the gs has a manual if you would take a coupe in addition to a sedan then i could come up with more enjoy cybersol i agree that you should check out the g35 nissan maxima  is350 if it comes in stick i am also confused by your tl negatives ive got a tl and 1stly i think the voicenavigation is fantastic and love how its been integrated with the radio and cliamate control i really think its something everyone could appreciate 2nd you can get the car without it 3rd if you want navigation but have some sort of problem with voice controls you dont need to use them theres regular manual controls for everything too re dash lights as someone else posted theyre adjustable subaru legacy gt sedan or wagon is another option to look at the 2005 is more upscale interior than previous models performance is in par or greater than most of wat you have listed 250 hp250 ftlbs forge with turbo 25 liter and i forgotthe infinit g35 sedan with 6 speed  wow couldnt disagree more the 25 gt limited has you sit up high like a g35 the interiors very basic and very cheap feeling no auto window updown thats right one window has auto down cheapy leather clunky plastics and the engineayecarumba it pulls strongly but its load and sounds like it may break at any moment gas mileage is horrid even on the freeway at cruising speeds in 5th the engine is pulling high rpms if one runs 80 mph youre never gonna break 2222 mpg on a long trip you may as well look at the wrx sti and mitsubishi evo for that price range if youre looking for more space or less  junk in the interior but want to avoid the tl and cts theres always the g35 maxima se and altima ser for decent gas mileage go with the small simple japanese cars sentra ser spec v and corolla xrs they are fun and are more practical than the mini cooper s httpwwwautoreportnetindexhtmltm200501html well i guess this confirms that the 35 gr v6 will go in the next es the cx2535 must be an infiniti version of the actic concept httpmotortrendcomautoshowscovitindex18html the cx25 will probably get the 25 v6 vq used in the japanese skyline and fuga that engine makes about 210 hp 197 torque this bodes well for a g25 in the next model change it will battle the is250 325i and a4 18 acura csx what the hell is that when you google honda csx a lawn mower comes up yeah just what the es needs 300 hp through the front wheels and yet it will sell well i couldnt disagree more after making the rounds to many many dealers including subaru i understand why subaru owners are passionate about their cars their interiors may not be up to bmw quality but their drivetrain is every bit as good the forester xt premium for example cant hold a candle amenity wise to any car in this thread but it will go to 60 in 525 seconds and it costs 15k less than the 330 the 15k one could save could be invested in another car the market your houseetc so yes the compromise is in the interior but there is no compromise with the smoothness of the shifter engine or drivetrain while you might be right about the gas mileage running within legal limits will bump the gas mileage to about 30 show me any car that goes 0 to 60 in 525 seconds like the forester xtsee review in caranddrivercom  and gets 30 mpg going 80 on the freeway so yes the compromise is in the interior but there is no compromise with the smoothness of the shifter engine or drivetrain absolutely 100 disagree the engine shifter and tranny are rough unrefined loud and fill me with anything but confidence in the cars abilities while you might be right about the gas mileage running within legal limits will bump the gas mileage to about 30 show me any car that goes 0 to 60 in 525 seconds like the forester xtsee review in caranddrivercom  and gets 30 mpg going 80 on the freeway the scooby xt wont get 30 mpg running 80 mph according to edmunds the 2005 xt manual is rated at 2324 mpg for the freeway the engine runs to high in the rpm to approach that feat and at 90 mph i know it wont come even close to 24 turbo 4s are fun but not economical when matched to lousy gearing scoobies are fun but theyre not on the level of entry lux cars by any stretch \\x85that the legacy gt and forester xt have sloppy suspensions especially the latter which also has incredibly slow and numb steering even the outback configuration trumps them handily imo ironic since they raised the ride height the driver146s subies are the wrxs outback xt is the best compromise if you need utility actually i couldnt disagree more the shifter is snappy and crisp the suspension is taut and the car takes off like greased lightning faster than any other car in this thread it holds the road on par with the fx35x3 i agree it does not have the amenities and the vehicle does have a numb spot in the steering but it begs for more and you can give it more and it inspires the same confidence as the 3er and it cost 10k less than the other vehicles in this board i agree you give up some the interior of the scooby isnt up to the interior quality of these vehicles but you pay less get less amenities but more drive as for the gas mileage in this part of the country you dont fly around at 80 unless you want a big fat ticket so im not worried but people i know who have the car get 27 doing around 65 and thats just fine with me and did i mention it cost less than the other vehicles in this segment im not promoting the vehicle nor do i really believe it belongs in this thread imho it has the guts to compete with these other fine cars at a different level maybe less luxury and amenities but it will blow the doors off of them to some people thats important to others its not there is no right or wrong ymmv did i mention the scoobies all come standard with lsd ot remember the econ 101 concept of marginal utility thats where the entry level luxury sedans come up short in my opinion lets face it most of us do most of our driving in rather routine commuting those of us in the midwest dont have many exciting roads to drive unlike much of the west and east coast i started my search looking at tls tsxes and g35s then the scottish hertitage kicked in and i asked myself why should i pay 30k for my 8 mile city commute i just couldnt rationalize it i ended up with a camry sev6 not as luxurious as the the tl or es330 although same powertrain as the latter not as fast as the g35 not sporty as the bmw but for me the marginal utility of that extra 710000 just wasnt there its luxurious and fast enough for me though obviously for many of you it isnt im off to see the new 3series at soldier field chicago tuesday should be fun m designman  in terms of handling the only car that can be considered to be more poised is the bmw 330i driving the old gen legacy on twisty mountain roads was pure fun the new legacy gt with power can hold its own with any of the cars in this segment its known for having one of the most stable driving feel on bumpy roads bumpy roads and sport suspensions are like oil and water so if a legacy gt is good in that environment it is testament to its soft suspension151ability to absorb shock i will agree to disagree with you on this and i find that the reviews overrated it considerably bumpy roads and sport suspensions are like oil and water so if a legacy gt is good in that environment it is testament to its soft suspension my 330 was great in that environment does it have a soft suspension i havent test driven the legacy but test drove the forester and outback maybe they arent up to bmw standards but for many  less they are darn close 147my 330 was great in that environment does it have a soft suspension148 sorry to have to tell you this your 330 is not great in that environment bumpy roads and sport suspensions are like oil and water so if a legacy gt is good in that environment it is testament to its soft suspension151ability to absorb shock i will agree to disagree with you on this and i find that the reviews overrated it considerably totally agree with your last statement do you live in nj have you driven on our roads the foresteroutback330 had the same amount of teeth jarring which i found perfectly acceptable given the sporty nature of the cars conclusion the suspensions of these vehicles have the same tautness with the 330 naturally being the best tuned doesn146t matter where you drive the legacy gt handles like a boat whether it146s the atlantic or indian ocean outback has a much tighter suspension forget about the forester its not even on the map in the handling category leads me to believe that like the legacy you havent driven it hmm you may be right about the legacy i dont think i drove it i drove the outback my impression was it was more trucky like ive driven so many they all blend in but surely the forester xt will not outhandle a sedan but for what it is silky smooth shifter power galore with the turbo taut suspension spacious crossover 53 to 60 lsd and  less than an x3 its a perfect vehicle for some heck itll blow past an fx45 can you tell i had a blast driving it the cabin noise from the windup of the turbo is right on the money although it clearly does not belong in the entry level segment as the amenities are not up to others in the segment its a lot of bang for the buck and finally for those who dwell on such things its reliable and it got the iihs best pick comparing it against a 330 no its not all that but you know what its 15k less and subaru scrimped in the amenities not the engine handling or drivetrain i need to make a purchasing decision in the next few days i have narrowed the field down to two an infiniti g35 rwd sedan or a subaru legacy gt ltd wagon i can get either car for 500 over invoice via the costco program and the two cars are within a couple of hundred dollars of each other with the options i want for the g35 i opt for rwd because i live in the california where there is no real need for awd id go with the at because i feel the g35 accelarate more smoothly with the at while the 6mt is a bit notchy and also less practical for my daily commute for the subaru i opt for the wagon because i love the oversize sunroof and the wagon is a bit roomier and also looks a bit nice my personal opinion unfortunately the at does not work well with the 25 turbo in the subaru and the 5mt with sti short throw shifter and momo shift knob is so much fun to drive that it reminds me of a mazda miata so i think id go with the mt for the subaru now the questions 1 my wife is a bit concerned about the durability of turbo engine as we plan to keep our car for a long time we kept our last two cars for 1015 years is this a good enough reason to stay away from the subaru 2 how is the predicted reliability of subaru compared to infiniti this is our no 1 priority so far we only have experience with honda and toyota which have been pretty much trouble free can i expect the same level of quality and reliability from subaru or infinitinissan 3 is 500 over invoice a good price for these cars is it worth bargaining for a price that is significantly better than costcos your help is most appreciated thanks some thoughts 1 cars with turbos in the long run are probably less problem free than cars without in 15 years who can tell what the reliability of a turbo car is but in 15 years what will be the reliability of the g35 2 you can get a lot of reliability information from the annual car buyers issue of consumer reports you can read the subaru and infiniti forums for some insight as to the types of issues people are experiencing 3 i would starting negotiating under invoice and work my way up rather than to work my way down good luck in 7 years of ownership the only major outofpocket expense on my a4 18t was a turborelated repair that cost me about 600 so take that for what its worth but it is one reason why i downgraded the saab 93 as a replacement for the a4 i just didnt want another turbo for longterm ownership ended up with a 325i look under the hood and youll see a lot of extra plumbing sensors controls etc that are related to the turbo and the thought of something in there spinning at 20k rpm for years and years makes me cringe  back in the 1980s when chrysler was the largest producer of turbocharged engines in the world i had not one but two of their cars both were running strong at 100000 miles when i traded them in and i had no doubt that they would have continued to provide me with excellent service had i decided to keep them having said that within my immediate sphere of family and friends there were five other mopar turbos that i was aware of and each one of them required a turbo replacement within the first 75000 miles one needed two turbo replacements the only difference that i could figure was that while we all followed the standard maintenance plan i used mobil1 while the rest of them used whatever oil their dealership happened to use i switched to mobil1 from castrolgtx when i got my first turbo simply because id heard of bearing issues due to the oil being coked when the oil supply was abruptly cut off from the hothigh speed turbine bearings at engine shutdown i reasoned that the synthetic oil would be much more capable of resisting coking and while my sampling of two isnt definitive it was enough to cause me to use nothing but mobil1 in every car ive had since then best regards\\nshipo and on my a4 turbo they had a recommended oilchange interval of 5000 miles vs 7500 miles for the 30 v6 model of the same car even with that i heard that there were some issues with engine problems caused by the coking up of the oil if it was not changed on time or a substandard grade was used i got a letter from audi regarding this a few months after i had sold the car fortunately i sold it to a friend of mine down the street so was able to pass on the warning to him i havnt seen much input on the small mecedes sedan the c230 supercharged etc does any on have any input on this one especially compared to bmw 325 and audi a4 thanks heres my two cents i test drove two 05 c230s back in november one was a sport coupe with an automatic the other was a sport sedan w6 speed manual i drove the auto first and was dismayed by the noticeable lag on take off the 6 speed on the other hand had no noticeable lag and i couldnt tell the difference between it and a normally aspirated six as far as the shifter goes it was silky smooth quick and short the road holding was good but a little softer than im used to though not as soft as mbs reputation for a soft ride  i had no intention of buy an automatic its just that they didnt have any sticks on the lot when i went looking youre welcome ps for what its worth i wound up buying a 05 325i zsp in january never drove the a4  i have an aversion to fwd i just sold my 04 wrx and got an 05 g35x\\nthe wrx is something like 227hp the legacy is 250hp with half a litre more displacement\\n4cyl vs 6cyl you are going to be reving that subaru above 3k to keep it in the powerband the low end is real hard to find with the subaru\\nthe subaru manual transmission is like shifting a tractor i always felt like i was racing and working hard while driving the wrx i just push the pedal and cruise along with the g35 power is always there when you need it johni i understand and am not debating that point i was only pointing out that after a test drive or two i understand why there is almost a cult like following for the cars they are not entry level luxos but the drivetrain is beyond reproach and the shifter is silky smooth the forester for example was clocked at 53 to 60 by cd with only 210 hp like the bimmers these cars are sleepers but again i realize the luxury factor is not up to their bigger cousins thats the problem with getting into the luxury segment you get spoiled by all the features that you did quite well without when you didnt know about them  two cars ago i owned a sentra ser that i thought was a really great car  sort of the early 90s equivalent to the wrx in being a pocketrocket sleeper type of compact car when i got my a4 i suddenly woke up to all the features that i didnt have in the sentra power windows climate control great stereo and on and on now i dont think i can go back to what now seems like a strippeddown car like the sentra and in retrospect even my a4 seems like it was lacking compared to my 325i how did i ever get along without memory power seats  and i just read a road test the other day of a car in this segment and the reviewer knocked it down because it had heated seats but no heated steering wheel if you can believe that i agree 98 after living with a 3 series for a few years i got very spoiled i like the extra luxo stuff no doubt however i realized the loaded outback would be quite acceptable to me as would the forester xt premium i do want the power this power that heated this and automatic that and leather i found out dont need a premium brand and i can gracefully step down the luxo factor and still like the car with the additional requirement for more cars in the family im thinking through the difference between what is wanted and what is needed i too love the luxury features shades  and determine which car i get more by those features than the brand with my vw the coolest lux feature that i miss very much  is rainsensing windshield wipers certainly im fine with the regular hi low intermittent but its great having wipers that change automatically wo my having to adjust them speed sensing comes close but no cigar the most annoying lux feature on my vw was the redundant radio controls 1 they operated as a seek button as opposed to scrolling through the presents which was quite annoying 2 they were on the righthand side of the steering wheel for some reason i really like those controls on the left if i want to use my righthand the dash isnt much farther away with my current car 04 tl the top luxury feature is the voicerecognition nav system thats integrated to receive voice commands for the radio and the climate control system totally unnecessary as i can now change the radio stations by using the standard controls the controls on the steering wheel or my voice but totally fun for all you feature buffs out there with heated seats  theyre pretty good for keeping your takeout food warm on the drive home kind of like a builtin sternoflame anyone else have some favoritehated lux features to share our 3series has heated seats which i love and the rainsensing wipers i thought that was a totally overthetop feature but it is really nice even with adjustable intermittent wipers i was always changing the adjustment to match the current amount of rain the rainsensing wipers work so well they seem connected directly to my brain sometimes i dont even realize they are on memory power seats if your car has two drivers this is a great feature 10way power seats are a pain if you have to readjust them and find your spot with the memory i just push one button before i get in and it is right where i want it next car heated steering wheel regards\\nkyfdx but the drivetrain is beyond reproach and the shifter is silky smooth unless one likes smooth refined and buttery easy i like my engines to feel solid and not make any hustle or bustle when pressed  like a bmw inline 6 or an audivw turbo the engine should pull and i should not get a sense of nvh or that the engine will burst from the hood every turbo subaru is fun but its way too unrefined for my tastes the transmissions imo make bmw trannies seem good thats a major accomplishment considering how bad their manuals are anyone else have some favoritehated lux features to share not a lux only feature now as i can get it on the mazda 3  xenon headlights sorta a big fan of my bmws tilt down passenger mirror too and yes as others have said memory seating is huge thats kinda it i dont know what car you drive but one of the the cars i tested turbo had a drivetrain beyond reproach the engine never gave me a sense it would burst in fact it threw me against the seat on full acceleration and the engine was just as smooth as the i6 now people have been reporting picking up loaded models from anywhere between 25k and 26k so thats 15 grand less than my 3 series with 53 to 60 as reported by cd thats a 15 grand difference from a loaded 3 series so for 15 grand ill live with some of the shortcomings maybe ill put a down payment on a house memory power seats if your car has two drivers this is a great feature id insist on them even if i was the only driver why have you ever spent the time to get your 8 10 or even 12 way manual sport seats adjusted just so only to need to valet park your car ive done it entirely too many times like 23 times per week for nearly 12 years and it seems like three out of every four times when id reclaim my car the parking valets had somehow managed so mess with every single adjustment knob lever and handle forcing me to spend half of the trip home constantly focusing my attention on adjusting the amp seat instead of on the traffic surrounding me best regards\\nshipo i dont know what car you drive but one of the the cars i tested turbo had a drivetrain beyond reproach the engine never gave me a sense it would burst in fact it threw me against the seat on full acceleration and the engine was just as smooth as the i6 well so far about 5 wrxs two legacy gt 25s a couple forester xts not a single one felt smooth or refined all were exceedingly rough and the nvh was astounding fast economy carsbut still leaving no doubt about their origins now people have been reporting picking up loaded models from anywhere between 25k and 26k so thats 15 grand less than my 3 series with 53 to 60 as reported by cd thats a 15 grand difference from a loaded 3 series so i can buy a g35 mt6 for probably 10k less than a 330i perf pack but the engines still a loud balky unrefined nissan 35 matched to a notchy tranny and a weird tach that flashes lights savings and speed arent really important to me if the cars not as refined exactly different strokes for different folks there have been a never ending series of posts about the notchy bmw shifter shall i dig them up there are also varying opinions about bmw shall we discuss those as well subaru builds cars of a different focus than bmw and for those who like them the cars are on target here peruse this link at your leisure click here i now understand that when a bmw gets their doors blown off by a forester turbo the mindset of ahhh its only a subaru my 98 grand prix had a heads up display i do miss that even though i have had my tl for a year now i occasionally catch myself looking at the spot on the windshield for the hud information that and the supercharger are the only things on my grand prix i miss i agree shipo my last 2 cars had memory and even though i was the driver 99 of the time they were helpful after having to move my seat to reach something or vacuum or whatever what is a heads up display and hud info a hud heads up display projects information onto the windshield much like in a jet fighter the grand prix displayed the speed turn signals radio stations when you change them low fuel and check gauges the hud unit sits on top of the dashboard immediately in front of the driver its a lcd display with a mirror that reflects the display onto the windshield its been around for several years at first i thought it was a cute but useless feature but when you get used to it it really is nice to have i dont know why entrylevel luxury vehicles dont have them confuse kd so the doors are blown offand an sti will obliterate just about anything that isnt called vetteviperor stickers under 70k shrug weird that youre on the side of power at all costs i thought you appreciated the intangibles associated with a luxury sedanvehicle i think you do but youre smitten with scoobies and theyre awesome cars for the price and goal  crazy performance decent materials long term reliability and nearly unbreakable my silly broinlaw has tricked out a wrx to crazy levels the car is a monster and he treats it like a redheaded step child that broke his bottle of mad dog he seriously beats that poor car and it runs like a champ its amazing how it runs and runs so yeah his little 23k wrx with 56k in mods will out right spank the pants off a bmw maybe even an m3 but i wouldnt take a 500 mile trip at 120 mph in his car no way in hades day to day i couldnt live with his gnarly raspy exhaust and the osbcene handling abilitycoupled with rough ride i want the smoothness the composure the ability to get 30 mpg running 100 mph all day so the doors are blown offand an sti will obliterate just about anything that isnt called vetteviperor stickers under 70k shrug weird that youre on the side of power at all costs there 3er is the benchmark and it has the perfect combination luxury and performance all other luxo cars are a compromise in terms of one or the other however i acknowledge it does not have the luxo features of the bimmer or its sleek smooth sophistication but it flies like a bat out of you know where yes its uberfast ive considered an sti but fear id flat out kill myself not sure i could put up with the racket either wrt to a comment in an earlier post you might say the car needs to be driven the same way as an s2000 miata or rx8 none of these cars are much good keeping the revs below 2k need to move the little needle up a ways to extract some performance one could also make the assertion you get 120 the performance with 50 of the luxo value at 75 of the price i dont know if that averages out to better value than the bimmer or not blush  its just another direction one might want to go when shopping wrt to a comment in an earlier post you might say the car needs to be driven the same way as an s2000 miata or rx8 none of these cars are much good keeping the revs below 2k need to move the little needle up a ways to extract some performance uh thats true of bmws too and all the scoobies to get a bmw to move you better have the tach north of 3k rpm 4k in a zhp \\nits just another direction one might want to go when shopping true true im all over the place with what i want i want a hatch a convertible a sedan hmm thats why im seriously considering an a3 or mazdaspeed3 and then pick up a used miata or z4 a year or two down the road or if bmw will confirm a 130 then get a simple convertible for a year or two and the 130 will join it eventually about your new car considerations if you want an a3 you may have to wait like half a year for the 32 version which is the one that would really have you pick it over the mazda in performance the 20t just isnt powerful enough to compete with that also the 32 is supposed to have the dsg transmission from the tt 32 but neither a3s are supposed to have quattro until next year and bmw isnt giving us the 1 series the 1 series is the europe and asiaonly hatch america is getting the 2 series a tiny coupe and convertible model but youre not going to be able to get it until like 2008 its still developing about the a3 again if you want your car soon and have the  maybe you could spring for the s4 avant instead and have more performance luxury and equal style for a bigger price tag this is because that the 32 isnt coming soon or if you cant afford that look at the a4 avant or sedan 32 its supposed to really fly anyway bmw already did confirm a 130i and its already on sale in other parts of the world its the 230i you want also i dont know how long you can wait but the next tt is supposed to be a major rocket its going to have an audi alluminum space frame and its going to also have the next generation audivolkswagen v6 a 36 v6 first being used in the upcoming passat is going to generate some 280 horses and thats not all audi is going to make a tts supposedly with the 340 horsepower v8 from the s4 if it can fit and a tt rs but i dont know what that monster is gonna have it should give the porsche boxster s and the mercedes slk 55 amg a major headsup or theyll eat its dust if they dont put the 911 engine in the boxster and make an slk 63 amg the 20t just isnt powerful enough to compete with that also the 32 is supposed to have the dsg transmission uh the dsg is going in the 20 also dsg is already available in europe on the a3 and gti httpwwwtiscalicoukmotoringroadtestswhatcaraudia3hatchback210359fullhtml and bmw isnt giving us the 1 series the 1 series is the europe and asiaonly hatch the 1 series is in mexico right nowmexicos not in asia or europe last time i checked in fact last weekend a friend saw a 1 series at fashion valley mall here in san diego it had baja mex plates on it so you might want to amend that statement a3 again if you want your car soon and have the  maybe you could spring for the s4 avant instead and have more performance luxury and equal style for a bigger price tag s4 avant  big fat lazy pig that thing weighs nearly 2 tons 3957 to be exact if i wanted something fast id just keep my 330i zhp the 20 is under 30k nicely optioned and it gets 31 mpg v 21 mpg take the extra 20k and go buy a used miata and mod it to the high heavens  this is because that the 32 isnt coming soon or if you cant afford that look at the a4 avant or sedan 32 its supposed to really fly anyway bmw already did confirm a 130i and its already on sale in other parts of the world its the 230i you want \\nspend some time on bimmer boards the success of the mazda3 and possible success of the a3 will most likely mean the invasion of bavarias smallest soldier if the a3 flops bmw wont bother also i dont know how long you can wait but the next tt is supposed to be a major rocket its going to have an audi alluminum sic space frame and its going to also have the next generation audivolkswagen v6 a 36 v6 first being used in the upcoming passat bzzzzt im sorry thats not correct audi and vw are not using the same engine audi is wedded to a true v6 as it is shorter and is able to be mounted longitudinally and still allow for a nice installation for awd vw is reverting back to a vr6 design for the new passat with is a longer mill requiring a transverse installation and an awd system similar in nature to what the audi tt has sported for a few years given the numerous inaccuracies in you post i find myself wondering where you got your information could you kindly post references to your sources so that the rest of us can steer clear of them thanks best regards\\nshipo anyone choosing right now between these cars have an opinion on how the new 3 series fits into the mix anyone tempted by the last of the old 3 series thanks cybersol the new 3 is a little less driver focused than the old one but in most ways objectively a better car dave i have its a better car than my 330i performance package yes the interior is not as cockpit like and yes they moved the window controls to the wrong place left side door but otherwise the handling is unflappable the steering more precise the roadholding amazing road noise lowered engine is more responsive and the car is all around far more fun to drive yes i did i agree with blue about the window switches and while i agree that objectively its a much quicker car it still didnt feel as fun to drive for me maybe ill change my opinion if i drive it again dave i am coming off the lease of a 03 330i and i have been shopping a great deal in the recent months i like many on this board am in need of a family friendly sedan 4 doors that will serve primarily as a commuter for me i drive about 50 miles a day i thought for a while that i would like the g356mt but after driving one for almost a day i was not a fan with the way the car set up the interior had maxima written all over it to be honest it is the interior they shouldve put in the maxima the performance was strong and obviously fast but it did not possess the crisp feeling of my 330i so the g35 became an after thought i will speak more on it later so now it is going to come down to the tl v bmw i had the honor of taking out the new 06 325i 6mt yesterday and a tip of the hat to everyone waiting for one i know what the horsepower says and i can read the 060 times but i say without hesitation that the new 325i absolutely rips the g35 and tl apart it feels as fast as my present 330i and the driving experience is actually improved it is truly another typical bmw how do they do that experiences and after driving the 3 cars anyone who says the g35 or tl is close to the 325i is saying that because that is what they have in their garage i am coming at you honestly bc i am leaning towards the tl but the fun factor of driving the 325i is not even measurable it truly is a 4door sports car the sales person asked if i wanted to take the 330i out and i said no reason being is if i do i know i will regret not getting one every day i drive something else the other big positive is the new stereo is about time the hks in bmws are flat out garbage and have no business being in such a car the new logic 7 sounded awesome for the little time i used it however the feeling from the drivers seat is tight both in a good way and a bad way it is a fully connected driving experience but it still feels small a cruising machine this is not now the real bad there is no noticeable difference in back seat room i am 6 tall and i would want no part of sitting behind me also a very big flaw it getting in the passenger seat i must have looked funny as i got in and out several times and each time i hit my left knee on the dash which is now bowed out rather than in i can hear my wife now saying how much she hates getting in and out of that thing i like the look but i just feel from the outside the tl looks more aggressive something about the lower rockers that make it look more aggressive i like the front and the back does not bother me but i bet that when the m3 hits we all say wow thats they way they all should look much like the 5 series and m5 that brings me to the tl and away from the g35 since i feel and you will too if you ever drive the new bimmers that there is nothing like them it does not make a difference what else you get it is not the best so other factors then come into play the total size and interior of the tl i find gorgeous not to mention they have every toy in the book the germans make engines and the japanese make technology the nav system and stereos on the tl are as you know simply the best around the seats are big and comfortable and the back seat is perfect for a father of one who is getting bigger every day i live in the northeast and front wheel drive also has advantages simply put the tl is a fast and very nice touring sedan that is perfect for a commute i still need to give things a little thought i really would love the bmw but i think the tl is a better fit for my life in 2005 i am going to be very jealous though every time i see a 330i screeming around some turn and the driver smiling from ear to ear i hope you liked my take djocks pick up the tl for your everyday familycommute requirements buy a used 3er for weekend fun it sounds like you wont be happy with anything but a 3 of course growing up and having a family often means sacrifice which is why im driving an 05 tl instead of an aston martin db9 tl is a great ride but ive never driven a 3 as a skiier grew up with fwd and have always driven fwd of course with the lousy in the snow oem bridgestones on my tl a rwd bimmer would probably have been better this past winter youll probably scamper back the the bimmer like monkey on fire ive driven both and thought that the tl was like general anesthesia just haul around a lowspeed corner quickly in the tl p i have gone around corners many of times at high speeds in my 03 tls and it feels pretty darn gone good i have gone around corners many of times at high speeds in my 03 tls and it feels pretty darn gone good yeah i bet exiting that corner you were at wot too right p oh thats right you cant do that with a tl i appreciate your assessment i have a tl and didnt bother looking at the bmws bc i needed a larger car too it wouldve had to be a 5series and theres no way i could afford it anyway i love my 04 6mt tl wnav and dont understand other posters comments re turns the tl handles great  nice and tight yet very comfortable the only negative is torque steer in fact while im sure bmw are faster my tl gives me more power than i can use great acceleration great handling great features etc only problem is the torque steer i test drove the 05tl 05 g35 and 05 3 series i totally disagree with the aforementioned assessment as i opted for the g35 sedan i added the sport suspension with 18inch rims and the handling is right in the 3 series league the rwd drive is the number one attribute to a real performance car and that eliminated the tl in addition the tl  3 series doesnt have the umfff factor that the g has the power and acceleration is head snapping infiniti put there dollars into the performance it is a very good value and i felt that it would make an excellent highspeed cruiser but the car just didnt feel good or dialed in when going through curves at least as compared to the 330i i drove or even my underpowered audi a4 with the ittybitty 18 turbo quattro i admit that this is solely my subjective impression as the test data that i have read in car mags indicate that the tl does generate good handling numbers but the communication just doesnt seem to be there the tl i drove really didnt like fast tight turns might just have been that the tires werent at a proper pressure but cant argue with the tl pricing the car is a nice deal especially compared to the 330i but between the two id shell out the extra  for the bimmer but i guess i better give the g35 a look byron i would look at the 5 series more also if it were not out of my budget i am going to drive the tl again on tuesday but the first time i thought it drove very nice the acceleration was as you said all i would ever need and the creature comforts and toys on the inside are absolutely second to none torque steer aint gonna bother my none on the merrit pkwy in ct and it just those times when you really feel like having fun that you will see the difference i can not get over how bmw improved so much on what was already the best driving experience in the class i am also looking hard into an x3 i just wish i liked the look more djocks anyway i will keep you posted it just those times when you really feel like having fun that you will see the difference thats been my experience regarding the looks of the bmw i decided awhile ago the exterior looks of a vehicle is tertiary even less important than secondary yes it can provide an ooohh factor with the valet but if the interior is nice and the drive is good thats all i care about when it comes right down to it the choice between the tl bmw and g35 is about what is important to you if performance is what is most important to you the bmw or g35 is the way to go they both excel excuse the pun in the performance department but imho they are a little shy in the size comfort and luxury area if you are looking for a mix of good albeit not top notch performance with luxury the tl is hard to beat especially at several thousand less than the comparably equipped bmw and g35 i testdrove all 3 14505 bmw not 14606 i bought and am very happy with my tl good assessment reminds me of a post i read where someone called the tl a sporty luxury car and the g35 a sports car with some luxury features hi guys jumping in a little late here in this discussion but i also test drove all the above in addition to the avalon and the maxima i eneded up with the g35x for a couple of reasons imho it handles as well as the bmw the brakes were a little better than the bmw the acura is a really nice piece but i felt cramped in it im 61 and around 265lbs also the back seat of the tl seamed smaller than the g35xs i believe that any of the cars you are looking at will make you smile its a tribute to the manufacturers that we are having this discussion enjoy whichever one you choose and good luck with her so you really dont like the lexus es huh they are all very good cars the one you buy is of course the best i bought my 05 tl over the g35x for the smoother quieter ride and imho superior exteriorinterior style and interior materials consumer reports and car and driver both tested these cars and the tl was the fastest even faster than the g35 coupe only the bmw m3 was faster than the tl for about 10000 more the bmw has slightly better road feel but the tl handles great around tight turns i think some of you people are just in love with bmw label the tl is the best value and a great car p unfortunately crs testing is not duplicated in the real world while its true the tl did post good numbers in the slalom the 3 series beat the tl by a big margin in emergency handling and other manuevers so if you want to drive around slaloms in your daily commute and if you want the toys and dont mind torque steer get the tl if you want a drivers car get the 3 or g35 yes the bmw does handle better but cr rated the tl handling as excellent but i disagre the tl is a drivers car additionally the g35 fish tails unexpectadly they also said the 2005 tl is deviod of torque steer i test drove a 330i plus the g35 coupe and they didnt feel faster than the tl to me in fact the tl as reported again by cr was faster in 0  30\\n0  60\\nquarter mile bmw m3 333hp 555mph\\nacura tl 270hp 525mph this makes the tl very competitive with bmw re cornering however cr did say the tl is not as nimble as the bmw or the mercedes c class but its not bad  the one you buy is of course the best and i will add for your particular needs its silly to argue one choice over another based on a magazine review the magazine reviewers have different sets of criteria cr is biased towards overall functionality they view the car as a transportation appliance the enthusiast magazines are looking primarily at overall performance since most of us dont have californias exciting canyon roads to traverse that last little bit of handling prowess that the bmw may provide over the fwd tl isnt a meaningful differentiator i find the rt and cd reviews a little more helpful since they come up with a numeric score that allows the reader to weigh hisher criteria differently and possibly arrive at a different conclusion as has been pointed out many times these g tl 3 are all very good cars and most of us would be happy with any one of them ultimately its probably going to be something subjective eg interior quality exterior appearance that sways us to one over another excellent post cr does push the cars for performance and cr does not accept advertising so i believe they are more objective they also give scores based on many criteria i was just responding to people who claim the tl is a slow ponderous car when in fact its faster than most bmws and corners almost as good they also said the 2005 tl is deviod of torque steer horse hockey i couldnt give one rip what was published in cr i drove a 3pedal tl and my friends that thing has torque steer period full stop the end best regards\\nshipo here we go again i hope riez can bring his lsd posts those are good too horse hockey lol i bought a tl for my wife so it had to be an automatic so i have not driven a tl mt i will check it out for myself this weekend i am now in the market for a car for myself so this forum is really helping out thanks all however when professional drivers who work for a nonprofit organization who spend hours testing a car tells me there is no torque steer i believe them but shipo if you and your friends found it did have torque steer i will be on alert thanks i just something else shades i just might buy something else i drove a 3pedal tl and my friends that thing has torque steer if i recall various reviews correctly the manual has lots of torque steer but the automatic very little i think it was cd who said they preferred the auto tl due to the torque steer of the manual i have never experienced torque steer is it a serious problem if so the tl is out and the g35 and bmwi are my next choice love the exterior of the g35 coupe especially the black ones torque steer is not a problem its a characteristic of fwd the mt tl that i drove had it and i didnt like it but it does sound as if there is for reasons unknown to me less torque steer in the auto tranny variant tl which i did not dirve never have owned an atequipped car only a small amount of us lunatic fringe types are really bothered by torque steer fwd and all the acura is a pretty nice deal it just aint my deal p drive em all and make yer call byron i speak as a former owner of a 1998 a4 28 which i sold for a 2005 tl last november i bought the tl because my kids were getting too big for the a4s back seat i also drove the g35 the g35 interior was just too cheesy for me the steering and power were great but i found the g35 skittish on high speed corners where bumps existed the tl is second to none in features and has a very nice interior its power is great i must say now that after 8000 miles on it i still dont think its handling compares to my a4 it is pretty good compared to most cars but i was spoiled by the a4 the tl is a little floaty going around curves when bumps are present i drive to work up a canyon road for a 2 mile stretch and it is a great spot where the handling differences come out i still really enjoy the tl and will keep it for many years but when the kids are gone to college im going to get a bit better handling car needless to say cars like es300 or suvs minivans are out for me from a handling perspective i guess im now picky enough that i need near the cream of the crop thanks bryon thats just the feedback i need i love my wifess at tl but i need to drive the mt tl to really get the feel of the car but i have this weird antibmw thing that i dont understand i test drove a 330i and loved it anyone know how the mercedes cclass is car is in good shape with 56349 mi as of this morning i realize this seems relatively cheap however i am going through a divorce and dont want my wife to get it or any money from the sale please call me 8136551328 or stop by the shop at 612 sommerstone dr valrico fl if in the areajo lots of posts on various boards about problems with this marques auto transmission at least in the 0204 model years have they finally fixed it or is this still and issue for the 05 models you are most welcome frisconick the manual tran in the tl is very nice you know if you really have that antibmw thing you might give the new audi a4 with the two liter engine a drive the a4 that i drove shifted great and the little twoliter engine hauls the hefty a4 around with authority a nicely equipped a4 prices out slightly above the tl and well below the 330i since im not having much luck finding a left over 05 330i with the performance pack i will probably end up in another a4 but why why why cant audi put a decent sport seat in the audi the tl  bmw seats are much sportier thanks byron if i like the manual tl and i dont dectect torque steer or the torque steer is not a big deal i will buy it on the spot i love my wifes automatic tl my next pick is the g35 coupe additionally what i have read in cr and my brother is a mechanic will verify german cars are not as reliable as japanese cars thanks imac you stated what i inferred and it is the bottom line until you decide otherwise the car you buy is the best carfor your needs wants and desires frisocnick just because someone states a fact on the internet does not in fact make it a fact and thats the fact jack dont believe everything you read some wonderful posts all over the boards here but you must do your own dd drive all the cars that are on your list before you decide youve got a tl enjoy it for the fabulous car it is hi laurasdada we have exchanged posts before and i really respect your common sense opions however i am a scientist and i know how cr tests cars and they follow the scientific method of course it is often subjective judgements but cr is the most objective of all because they are nonprofit cd advertises which comprimises their credibility its not just an internet opinion its cr cd advertises which compromises their credibility i dont think thats necessarily the case all the major car manufacturers advertise when the car mags do a comparison test something has to finish last regardless of advertising dollars spent i think if you looked back over the years youd find that the finish order changes and usually its the newest model that finishes first eg the new infiniti m series is winning most of the comparisons lately now if one manufacturer consistently won every comparison across all model lines then i might believe the editorial opinions were influenced by advertising dollars another thing that favors cr objectivity is that they buy the cars they test im sure the manufacturer supplied cars that the car mags test are gone over with a fine tooth comb before being given to the magazines to evaluate as long as they all do it i guess the playing field is level i would like to see ad dollars spent and rankings i have also heard that some of experts at cd getting free cars while youre at the acura dealer i recommend a test drive in a 6speed tsx its almost as quick as an autotrans tl and it handles much sharper  with no torque steer because it has no torque ha ha lots of posts on various boards about problems with this marques auto transmission at least in the 0204 model years lots of posts  what is alot a little balanceperspective  i own a 03 tlauto i have never had a problem of any type with any part of the car although acura checked out my tranny at my last oil change per a tsb the last time i checked approx 16  of the tl population had transmission problems  and acura did not shy away from their responsibility to repairreplace the tl is a great car still amazed at the thoughfulness that acura put into the little design detailsergonomics engine is flawless etc all car manufacturers will occasionally have technical glitches i believe the tranny thing was due to a supplier issue but as long as they step up to the plate and meet their responsibilities  they will have my support and future loyality ie cash ps a small compliant i can muster is that the sunglass holder between the visors seems to be missing in the 0405 models  if i am remembering correctly from test drive about a year ago cheers the tsx is not nearly as quick as the tl and i know you are yanking my chain p i put more credence in cr professional drivers than i do with posters here however i agree with you that you have to do your own testdrives and then make a choice you have another excellent post laurasdada and enjoy your new tl shades wildcatjon bmw 3series 2006 3078 29 may 2005 1221 am i own a 05 325xit and an 04 tl both with at i love both cars but they are different nothing handles like a bmw and it is a comfortable reasonably well equipped after paying for some options the tl does everything well and is extremely well equipped for no extra s  and is thousands less than the 325 the audio system is extra special it does have a little torque steer but only when pushed very hard  not in ordinary driving i have had no problems of any kind with the tl but had several with the bmw with under 1000 miles i had the air mass monitor fail the radio has a lot of static and just yesterday the blue tooth telephone connection stopped working i know i will like the all wheel drive on my bmw in the winter if i had to pick one i

by letting the road test editors get free cars i think these stories get started when someone doesnt agree with their reviews andor comparison test choices lets face it aside from the objective measurements every review is an opinion these guys have their own set of biases based on their experience just like we all do the only difference is that they drive cars for a living so their opinions are formed with more driving experience than most of us have they have days or weeks and many hundreds miles on which to base their opinions rather than the hour or less and probably less than 50 miles for our test drives great review posts like this really give readers valuable information byron i havent posted on this forum before so im just sort of starting a new conversation i think that youd be happier in an a4 if you have one right now than a new 3 ive seen two in person driving and theyre not very impressive to look at the 3 doesnt have as much presence as the old one while the a4 from the back looks like a little a8 after my 00 a6 27ts lease was up in april i was taking delivery on a new convertible i was pretty much completely sure of the s4 cabriolet which i have now and am obsessed with but i also checked out the m3 convertible it wasnt nearly as refined as the s4 and i am completely in love with my sprint blue s4 cabriolet i get so many admiring looks from people the neighbors love it and especially my family me my wife my son and my daughter and also my son who cant drive yet hes 12 fight over who gets the car next oh please do you really think these magazines would compromise their journalistic integrity by letting the road test editors get free cars yes great post i thought the tsx ride was much too rough for the price of the car especially considering the nice tl ride i was very disappointed in the tsx rotoryfan the 05 tl has removable sun glass holder in each front door storage compartments which are hinged nice kasper the acura tl does come in abyss blue with the option of either camel tanish but much brighter too much of a contrast for my taste or gray which i chose missed that one thanks for the catch i thought the ride in the tl was much too soft for a sport sedan especially considering the tight tsx ride i was very disappointed in the tl i thought the ride in the tl was much too soft for a sport sedan funny ive heard a lot of complaints that the ride was too harsh  i guess to each their own fyi  dont know which model you drove but the manual has a tighter suspension than the automatic unless the automatic is an aspec version a 6mt w the sport tires rides even tighter i dont think the tl is intended to be a true sports sedan like bmw or infiniti g35 i think it intends to be a very sporty car thats 1 notch above entrylevel luxury and i think it does that very well very well put ljwalters1 however the tl is a seriously quick car for a nonsports car i test drove a 330i 330ci and the g35 coupe and i am leaning towards the g35 just because its not a bmw tuff choice i admitt i really loved the 330ci i admitt the s4 cab is a great looking car best of luck with it as of now ive driven the sti tl an 05  06 330i and the new a4 two liter with a stick the a4 seems like a pretty good deal compared to the 330i i guess that the two liter really should be compared to the 325 there was about a month between the a4 and bimmer drive so i cant pretend to give any sort of objective comparison other than to say that they are both great frankly i can live with the exterior of the 330 but its the interior that seems wanting especially compared to the audi and the tl for 40 big ones i expect not only excellent road manners but an interior commensurate with the price later this year ill go back and give the a4 another spin and mostly likely buy one but my fav was actually the sti that little car ducks and weaves like ali and growls like a tasmanian devil in heat anyone that considers themselves a car enthusiast should consider taking one for a spin but the subie is a bit thirsty and frankly i feel that things are going to get nasty in the energy sector i currently manage a little better than 26 mpg with my 02 a4 and guess that the new a4 20t can even do a little better which is pretty good for awd ah the hard choices we must make byron great post again byron i cant justify the price of the 330i when the g35 can get you otd for 30000 and the tl for about 34000 plus bmw dealers wont bargain in addition 90 of my driving is highway so a tl automatic seems like the logical choice but i am totally in love with the g35 coupe oh god give me a sign i am totally in love with the g35 coupe oh god give me a sign i think its a psalm which ends like this love never fails but my fav was actually the sti\\nah the hard choices we must make read post above  you know whenever i see a g35 i know that it is a great car and looks good but for some reason the looks just dont work for me now out of all the aforementioned cars the tl is the looker looks great from every angle and all those bucks saved vs a bmw can buy stacks of my favorite things highfat ice cream bacon burritos burgers and memberships to exclusive gyms to work off all the burritos p btw apparently some bmw dealers will bargin just not the ones in ne ohio but still the price is a bit much byron i am looking to possibly pick up a 2005 or wait until 2006 tlcan someone give me some valid driving experiences in the snow live in new york especailly those without the bridgestone tires and how long do the michelins last i now own a 2000 maxima se which is terible in the snowand dont want to experience the same problems alsoif snow tires are needed must you buy for all 4 wheels and how much do you pay for a wide profile tire as thoseall help is appreciatedthe maxima tire prices are out of control and last about 25k miles know doubt the tl is this best deal alsoif snow tires are needed must you buy for all 4 wheels i dont have the experience to respond to most of your questions but can tell you that if you need snow tires you need them for all 4 tires in fact a website that sells tires might be tire rack  not sure will only sell snow tires as a set of 4 not sure if it was a fair fight seeing as the m35 is about 810k more but i gave each of these cars an extensive road test i have 2 friends with tls and i have really fallen for them however after i tried infinitis m35 i never went back to the tl at first glance the m35 is priced near 50k as seen on most dealer lots but i soon realized that was with their sport edition turns out their base model rides much smoother similar to the tl and is only 40k i opted for a couple packages and left the dealer at 446k ultimately the performance is pretty similar theyre both in that 270280 hp range i ended up making my decision on interior features and uniqueness one key factor was road noise  this was a hands down winner for the m35 as a frequent la freeway driver and as someone that often has passengers this was important other things i preferred on the m35  standard 18 wheels 19 on the sport more back seat leg room and way more exterior color options that said the tl is probably still the best buy on the market but i love my m35 i dont think the m35 is an entrylevel sedan hi al im in the boston area with an 05 nonnav tl bridgestone turanza el42 tires they are the worst tires in the snow that ive experienced in almost 30 years of driving at least that i remember i got through this past snowy winter with the aid of all the traction electronics common snowdriving sense and luck we took the wifes rx300 on our few ski trips but if i was going to regularly take my tl to me nh vt etc i would definately buy four snows or at the very least upgrade to a much better snow performing allseason in addition i believe these tires flat spot maybe that s a characteristic of low profile tires which is a bit annoying other than that they seem ok if you get a nav model or 6mt i think youll get different tires which others would have to comment on snowwise other than the tires im really enjoying the tl applied three coats of zaino on sunday the abyss blue looks great tst good post its funny i bought my tl over the g35x because i found the tl to be much smoother quieter ride and nicer interior stylematerials not to mention the superior exterior style of the tl probably a more apples to apples comparison would have been the rl to the m35 but luckily we both made the right choice in our purchases congrats enjoy the m it really is a nice piece of work infinitis on a roll always show the frontal and side views of the m and never a rear angle shot hmmmmm i bought the g35x over the tl for a couple of reasons nav was not important to me since i have an aftermarket garmin that suits my purposes i feel that the g35 has a roomier interior i also liked the all wheel drive functionality for the winter but that it is all but off when you dont need it making the car feel like a rear driver i grew up driving rear drive vehicles and i just prefer them the wife drives a saab 93 aero convertible and its a great machine but the torque steer while minimized is still annoying its really splitting hairs here these are both fabulous cars it amazes me that the manufacturers have improved so much over the years what a great time to be buying cars i hope everyone enjoys their purchase whatever it may be i feel that the g35 has a roomier interior thats odd because i came to the exact opposite conclusion i think the g35 is taller and narrower and has a bit more rearseat leg room than the tl but the rearseat headroom on the tl i found much better i know you can recline the gs back seat but i found it to be uncomfortable when reclined as far as space is concerned the tl felt wider roomier more like a grand prix compared to the g35 which i felt was similar to a grand am the 2 pontiacs were my last 2 cars before the tl i wish the tl had better storage compartments though i agree with you regarding the tl feeling roomier than the g i bet the measurements are similar but some aspect just makes the g feel more closedin to me maybe its as simple as the fact that the g35 i drove had a black interior  that couldve made it seem smaller regardless im happy with the tl and not sure what other storage space you would want aaargh weve got side door sill pockets that expand a bilevel center console thats so deep they added a light to it rear seatbacks a little flipout drawer in the back of the center console closableconcealable cupholders 2 drawers in the centerstack maybe more if you dont have nav and a decentsized glove box only thing i can figure is you want a sunglassholder in the roof or a drawer under the dash on the left side overall i think theres a lot of storage space i guess its each to hisher own regarding space they must be very similar once again they are both great cars the tl is on everybodys best buy list and the g35 is constantly compared to the bmw 3 series i think either choice is a good one  g35 can get you otd for 30000 and the tl for about 34000 plus bmw dealers wont bargain au contraire the dealer i spoke to seemed willing to sell me a 330i for 1500 over euro invoice 330metallic paintwinter package  xenons suroof logic 7 sterio etc standard   500 cca discount  34000  in addition 90 of my driving is highway so a tl automatic seems like the logical choice what i thought city driving was the reason people try to excuse their laziness dave i cant justify the price of the 330i when the g35 can get you otd for 30000 and the tl for about 34000 plus bmw dealers wont bargain huh thats just not true about bmw dealers being unwilling to haggle furthermore if you really want savings get the 3 series via ed 45k off msrp an e90 330i outfitted with leather sport metallica paint is about 35k before 1k dealer profit i went for a test ride for both the g35 and the tl and found the tll way more quieter than the infiniti i loved the interior of g35 and the price too\\nthe only deterrent was the noice level it was just too much noice for the money\\ni wanted a quiet car for all this money the dealer callled me today and mentioned that the car i did the test drive had a sports package fitted on it and that was the probable cause fro the noise he has asked me to drive one with the standard option what do you suggest is it going to be any different that what i have experienced or is the sports package designed to hear the vrooooooommmmmmm\\nsuggestions will be appreciated you should drive them back to back to get a good comparison the audio memory is very short so if you drive them even a day apart you might not be able to tell the difference the sport package adds stiffer suspension but im not sure that it would change the exhaust note i drove all three with automatics on an autocross course last year heres my take g35 the muscle car of the bunch powerful thirsty noisier engine the car the folks running the event told me after my lap to keep it down it will power slide in a heartbeat would be the fastest with a good driver who could maximize its engine potential enough interior room to scare 4 other people along with the driver tl the luxury bargain of this class plowed in hard turns but a comfortable ride and a roomy luxurious and quiet interior the one for a highway road trip with 4 passengers fast enough to merge on any expressway but not adept on a tightturning course 330i i havent driven the e90 yet but the e46 platform was the balanced sport sedan faster for me on the track because of the smooth power even braking and outstanding handling made me look smooth going flat out best for a 2 person car with occasional rear seat passengers i dont recall whether it was in this forum or the g35 forum but i heard others complain about noise and some posters said they should check the tire pressure before the test drive apparently cars are shipped with higher than normal air pressure and the dealerships often forget to let some air out of the tires these posters blamed road noise and a harsher ride on this issue you are right about tire pressure my car was delivered with high air pressure however i dont understand why people here complain about the noise level of the g35 the growl of the engine is one of the nicest sounding factory systems on the planetlink title for me its one of the enticing features of the sport sedan if you want quiet buy an es330 or an avalon i actually enjoyed the engine growl when i tested the g35x it was the wind and road noise that helped tip the scale in the tls favor for me for me its one of the enticing features of the sport sedan if you want quiet buy an es330 or an avalon my 330i with performance package will growl at wot but at a steady 8090 the cars engine and exhaust is quiet additionally the engine noise is nice and sounds like something impressive is happening under the hood in the g35 i felt the engine was abraisive uneven and transmitted lots of nvh above 4k the engine made a terrible racket and the tranny sent way too much garbage through my arm  like driving an old american 4 cylinder i never tested the 330i so i cant report on it but i did extensive tests between the tl and the g35x i didnt notice a large difference in nvh between the two the engine is defenitely louder in the g35x i guess i was swayed some by the all wheel drive in the g35x also my car is an automatic so the shifter vibration is a non issue

same price 30000 g35 cts or anything\\nwhat is the great deal about 25l 184hp 175lb 2005 model  jump to the e90 and get 215 hp then this power seems extremely weak almost volkswagen jetta power\\nis the ride really that good worth 30k\\nim thinking about g35 cts vs 325 around 30k\\nthanks in advance drive them its in the drive stat wise an 05 g35 6mt with 298 hp should motor past the 05 330i performance package in reality bmws 235 hp 30 gets the job done and seems to match a car with 60 more hp voodoo btw an 05 325i goes for about 5k below sticker right now an 05 330i is 78k below sticker i never really understood it until i drove one yes its hp is on the low side but the gearing is lower read the edmunds customer rating reviews good luck in your search look at the 06 the bmw hallmark of driving is smoothness and predictability smoothness at any speed predictable at all speeds i have not drivin one but i think i will\\nbut im thinking is it really worth 2x as much as a jetta with the same power\\nor im thinking test drive vs owning is different plus i really dont think\\na bmw will drivefeel that much better then a g35 cts\\n30k can get 400 hp 300 hp at least  200 hp and luxury as well\\nsince we are speaking performance i have to really drive to see\\nif 184hp is really worth the 30k\\nperformancevalue vs 300hp or 250hp\\ninteresting\\nthanks thedrak actually now that i think about it\\n184hp for 30k performance\\nsounds silly almost ludicrous the drive of the g35 is unrefined compared to the 3 series 298 hp does not equal superior handling over the bmw but this of course does not mean one would not want a cts g35 tl tsx etc over the 3 series then again some people chose the 325 over the g35 because they dig the better overall road feel and handling 310 hp 280 lbft of torque could be the a rocket but how will it handle well lexus made the is300 handle extremely well so if they choose to they can surely make it handle with that sweet engine hopefully they get the gearing down more than they did with the old is300 so at this point i am more concerned about two things with the new is can they restrain the electronic nanny enough to make it fun but most of all even if they get everything right what will they decide to charge i fear lexus has realized they have some brand cachet to bank on enjoy cybersol not adding much but my 2\\ni agree with the posting 3496 jamesspot and with the concerns of posting 3934 sid3 imo the g35 handles very well and comparing the price and reliability issues to a 330i i was seriously considering one however when testing it out i found the noise level unacceptable for me and would never buy it on that issue alone  im not a twenty year old the tl is just as jamesspot reviewed  he described my brothers driving style perfectly my brother is a retired banker and he loves the car i recently purchased a cpo 330cic for my wife  she loves the convertible im looking forward to testing out the is250350 i liked the is300 performancehandling a lot but it was a little small and boy racer for me if the new one handles close to the bmw and with a competitive price id sell my 540ia for one\\nregardless all these cars are great  were fortunate to have so much choice why has bmw resisted going to a 35 liter engine the numbers from bmws new engines are impressive but the competition is moving up to 35 liters some thoughts 1 they are trying to keep the power in the engines commesurate with the overall line up and the introduction of a 35l would throw everything off 2 they want their gas guzzlers to be the big 8 cylinder engines comparing the 35l in the g35 to the old 3l in the e46 a friend who has a simliar commute as me gets 17 mpg where i get 24 one cant have it both ways a bigger engine that is thrifty on gas but long on performance unless they play with the gearing one can probably expect realworld numbers to be inline with the g35 3 the heavier engine throws off the delicate balance of the car 4 a 35 engine would not substantially make the car faster people who post in the forums constantly say the g35 feels much faster than the 330i but the stats as quoted in the magazines over the years dont really bear that out kd good points and i think part of the engine sizepower has to do with an auto makers philosophy ford bmw and honda all seem to subscribe to selling well dont change it for years fords top selling explorer sported a massive 160 hp and a stump pullin 160 lbs of torque 4 ltr engine it sold well why change it in general the big three tend to follow this model with ford being the most conservative honda is another example i think that bmw follows this as well also why do we need more and more these automakers have all done well with the we dont need more fill in the blank to compete philosophy they take what they have and refine and polish when we bought our pathfinder we looked at the explorer and liked a lot of the features many of them very simple like the ability to fold the rear seats without taking the headrests off our accord is a much more thought out car than our pathfinder ill be sad to see it go why has bmw resisted going to a 35 liter engine the numbers from bmws new engines are impressive but the competition is moving up to 35 liters other than the g35 who else in this class has a 35 liter engine tl is at 32 a4 is 18 to 30 lexus es is 33 mercedes cclass is 2432 now that theyve tweaked the 3 liter to 255 hp why bother with another configuration i think the g35 is geared lower than most of the competition which is how it gets its slight acceleration advantage but fuel economy suffers if you look at the road test stats the g is turned at lot higher rpm than most of the competition at highway speeds other than the g35 who else in this class has a 35 liter engine tl is at 32 a4 is 18 to 30 lexus es is 33 mercedes cclass is 2432 well not quite the new c and e class mercedes are available with a 35 liter v6 and the new lexus is is

really compare when driven how the blazes can a 300 hp g35 not outrun a 330i performance package with its weak 235 hp engine for one second step back from your stats and actually experience the two perhaps magazine numbers show bmws with descent acceleration but\\n184 hp 225hp is still  300hp or 255hp but both cost 30000 i think bmws have been overhyped especially by all magazine reviews does a bmw really peformfeel better then a more powerful g35 you may not think so but youve not driven them apparently even people who opt for a g35 will admit the cars have distinctly different personalities i dont think so horsepower is part of performance and bmws have been way weak for a long time thats a fact if anyones looked at hp numbers bmw 3s have been under 200hp for years 3 years ago 330 finally made it above 200hp 30000 for  200hp cts 36l 255hp the 2001 330i is over 200 hp  225 to be exact at that time there wasnt any real competition for the 3 series is300 had already floundered in 2003 the g35 arrived and finally put some heat on the 3 series the tls sold well and will continue to without hurting bmw as its not aimed at the same kinda driver mbs never been big on power and audi wasnt all that either only over the last 3 years has hp become a big issue many would point to the g35 as the impetus for this actually drive the cars then comment on if it makes a difference that caddys cts makes 255 hp or infinitis g pulls 298 once ya drive them youll see its not all about the engine numbers audis 3300 lb a3 with automatic dsg and a 2 liter 200 hp engine runs 6263 060 dashesin 2003 the 260 hp automatic g35 with the 35 vq ran 6263 060 dashes obviously theres more to acceleration than a big engine bought my wife a tl and i love the car and love how fast it is now its time for me to buy my car and i am in a nice delima i dont want two tls in the garage so its between a g35 coupe or a bmw m3 or 330ci the price of the m3 seems way out of line but the 330ci is reasonable as well as the g35 but they are all very different cars i live near san francisco and do a lot of freeway driving to the tl makes a lot of sense the g35 is distinct bmws are all over the place there are not many on the road blueguy is spot on hp means nothing is the car cant manage it or the torque curve is doesnt support the cars personality you should do yourself a favor and take an e90 330 out for a long drive on a windy road then come back and say the car is underpowered overpriced and doesnt handle well while im not suggesting you automatically like bmw because its a bmw doing some research never hurts for starters heres a first drive review by edmunds on the new e90 330 the title is the next 3 is still the one to beat

choices too much with too much bias they dont effect my choices as a matter of fact i cant think of one person who was ever swayed by a review in a magazine for the most part the test drives speak for themselves the reviews are nice to have as tiebreakers but you dont like a bmw well dont get one ever notice why the ratings for all cars are so high over in the consumer reviews no matter what the model or make people shopped liked and bought what they saw and were very happy with it this to me is a strong indicator that through the rag conspiracy quite a few people are not sheep you prefer power others balance still others prefer the xyz a big rating factor that needs to be addressed in this thread is real world usability are any of us renting track time are we taking these vehicles over 810ths or have the skill to back road driving doesnt count i have a pathfinder with the q4 engine in it and although voted one on of the best v6s ever made it vibrates too much for me and the g35 is worse that i think is why bmw is so succesful they build cars that carve a sweet esse curve and take the wife to a nice dinner with a quite smooth rideand haul buttocks that is huge cd top ten

mt was a 2130 mpg car on the sticker heck even with a crummy automatic an e90 330i pulls 2129 httpwwwbmwusacomvehicles32006330isedantechdatahtm maybe you should find a better source for stats as kd pointed out strangely bmws when pushed above legal limits get even better mpg running an average speed of 87 from sf to san diego i got over 30 mpg in my e46 many people simply refuse to believe it it does fly in the face of physics that a car running 100 mph can get 2930 mpg voodoo again i guess when i had my barely broken in 530i on the autobahn in germany a couple of years ago i was delighted to discover that it was getting 24 miles to the gallon at speeds well in excess of 120 mph especially considering that it cost nearly 100 to fill it up funny thing many cars have their sweet spot for mileage sitting between 45 and 55 mph the two bmws that ive had were more like 75 to 85 mph go figure best regards\\nshipo my 002 the appeal of bmws might be because not everyone is that enamored of the hp number as some here are if that number is most important to you your g35 is cts etc all need to be traded in for the mighty mustang gt heck if bmw sold the 320i 150 hp in the us id be driving one of those right now claiming that 184 hp is underpowered is just plain silly my e46 325i definitely isnt underpowered and neither is my 318ti a whopping 138 hp in fact im not aware of any car sold in na that cant reach any posted speed limit and im sure they can all do it in a reasonable amount of time my 18 litre made it from atlanta to daytona 450 mi on one tank of gas 13 gal while averaging 90 mph for most of the distance i guess what im saying is that there is an awful lot more to a car than hp bmw underpowered no not enough power for your liking probably imho when you have reached where you buy 30k worth of car you would have or should have made a thorough comparison and you should also have reached an age when you can make decisions based on your own judgement like mentioned earlier we are spoilt for choice to each his own and let the testosterone belong where it should in a boy racer forum be happy and sport shades with confidence what you have you have hope made it here

there are some standard ratings everyone drives a little differently 5th gear the e90 all manual models has 6 gears and you keep posting the freaking e46 numbersthe car is no longer made the e90 330i is a 2129 and 2030 car as ive shown you with my post from bmwusa in other words the source and who says its not a factor lexus made a point of mentioning great fuel economy with their new is250350 bmw mentioned the increase in economy on the e90 too it does make a difference i know i can beat the hell out of my e46 all day and still get 2223 mpg while shifting at 55006k i also know from experience with a g35 ill get in the high teens doing that and no matter how i drive a g35 on the open roadit simply will not get 30 mpg 30 mpg as most have pointed out here is a snap with a 330i on the open road at hyper legal speeds after ownership anyone in here think about maintenance cost\\nbmw vs g35 yes most of us did and thats why many of us opted for included service cars like audi and bmw ive bought tires over the past 2 years two sets so farso about 2k on tires doesnt matter if i got a g35 or 330i id still be plunking down for new tires every 1315k miles of driving the people i know with g35s have had to pay for oil changes services some as little as 100 and others over 500 for 15k mile check and 30k mile check up getting an oil change every 75k with synthetic will run you at least 50 so even going low a g35 by 30k miles will cost at minimum not including tires 400 my bmw  0 but what about outside warranty average buyers in this bracket dont own more than 34 years i leased my 330i expressly so id never own it out of warranty in other words by 45k miles i will have bought tires for my car has it had problems in the first 30k miles yep they havent cost me one cent so i really dont care if the car breaks down it goes to the shop and gets fixed no big deal five minute drive to the dealer and i can always use my other car or get a loaner p why would someone pay 30k for 184hp when they can get 298hp for equal price yoperioddude bmw no longer uses the 184 hp mill in the 325i like it or dont its a fact get over it as for comparing cars on paper you are showing your naiveté by your constant reference to the numbers please go drive the damn things then maybe just maybe youll discover what the rest of us have already discovered numbers dont necessarily equate to value regarding the puny little engine in the former e46 325i take a look at the one lap of america results for 2005 the single well driven g35 beat the single well driven 325i by a measly 170 points 5195 vs 5025 or said another way by a margin of 3 hmmm it would seem to me that if the g35 was sooo much better than the e46 325i the margin of victory would have been far more significant best regards\\nshipo i find both cars outstanding the bmw cost a lot more for similar performance i have driven both however the bmw dealers are much less willing to deal than the infiniti dealer this tells me that the bmw 330ci is selling much better than the g35 coupe i think you cant get a feel by just test driving i think only after owning and driving as a owner can you really get the feel true but initial impressions are very powerful and research has shown them to be reasonably accurate your speaking to experienced bmw drivers me excluded drive one and do a comparo to the g35 in this thread you are quoting the latest model g35 a 2005 w298 hp it is only fair that you drive the 2006 325i w215 if you drive a 2005 it would only be fair to not compare it to a 2005 g35 but to a 2004 g35 physicsfacts on paper say a bee cant fly just to add to the discussion i purchased the redesigned 3 series in 1999 automatic 323i and currently still have it until i sell it the handling is unbelievable and quick enough for me even with 184hp i purchased the next generation 06 330i two weeks ago i really liked the larger and wider body style and technological advances the car offered i also test drove the lexus gs300 and bmw 5 series but decided on the 06 3 series overall i like the interior of the 06 330i better than my 1999 323i two aspects i am disappointed in are the harsh ride due to the run flats and the lack of initial acceleration the acceleration is very slow after a stop in fact my 323i has a smoother and quicker acceleration than the new 330i the ride is much harsher and i dont get the same hug the road feel as i do with my 323i i will seriously look at the redesigned mb c class when it comes out in 20072008 and possibly the next e class or 5 series i dont honestly think i will hold onto the 06 330i as long as i did with the 1999 model ok i will respond although issue will be dragged\\n3539\\nok 2130 2030 vs 2027 posted links for evidence\\nthere that

need a service car for backup\\nwhen did i write that i dont have two cars as backup i have them for different tasks meaning you expect your bmw to be in the shop at times i expect all cars to

remodelinghaha rediculus drive them until you do your spouting off is rediculoussic im through responding to you as youre showing yourself to be little more than hater with zero experience in the cars youre touting and denigrating the g35 is a fine automobile i pushed one and had the car react in a less than pretty way common complaint among reviewers tooincluding roadtest editor karl here at edmunds i was hot on the g35 until that moment i drive my cars hard and id rather not spend 3233k on a g35 that i feel is not gonna stay glued to the ground and that has nvh at levels i find disquieting ill drop 34510k more to get something that makes me happy if my purchase were ruled by dollars alone id own a 2001 honda accord hi tl owner here great car the point is why are 325 more worth it vs a g35 cts c230 tl  the only answer is that from purely an economic standpoint anything is only worth what a buyer is willing to pay for it if i had wanted a 325 i would have bought it and it would have been worth it to me 184 hp and all youre not buying horsepower youre buying a car to meet many personal criteria if all you value is hp maybe chrysler will sell you a viper v10 engine for your living room what makes our economy the well oiled machine that it is is the lovely law of supply and demand and of course competition laisse faire adam smith and all that economic stuffsimplifed explanation from a simple mind anybody can charge any price for anything they want but if there is no demand guess what that item is repriced eg gm cars employee pricing for everyone or withdrawn from the market are they still making the aztek for a myriad of reasons european cars have always been more exepensive than their domestic  japaneese counterparts although with the advent of acura lexus and infiniti european prices have come down more supplycompetition in the nearluxury market however as there is enough demand for bmw products well thats the price you pay doc you want bmw prices to come down to g35 levels youd better start convincing the kds and blueguys of the world not to keep buying bimmers obviously a bmw is overpriced to you you are correct to kd  blueguy a bmw is a good value they are correct i believe my tl to be a great car and value im correct im sure cts owners feel their car is fabulous they are incorrect drive em all buy one and enjoy all cars breakdown

8141persuing lemon law with g35 happy motoring sick i was all set to buy my first bmw a 330ci then i met the dealer no dealing you pay out the nose and thats it infiniti g35 dealers are much more flexible and the cars are very similar in perfornance and cornering but i sure wanted a bmw i would rather have my 05 cts than any of them great handling on the road i own neither a bmw i did own a 03 325ci or an infiniti but would like to say i agree with blueguy on this one drive both to believe it my 325ci with the old 184 hp was plenty whats up with the horsepower war buy what you like even if it is underpowered and enjoy it if you want power for the buck try a neon srt4 a wrx a lancer evo or a mustang just enjoy it did anybody read about the latest iihs side impact tests the a4 did very well but volvo the company who most people associate with safe cars still has some work to do as the pelvis risks being crushed in a side impact collision in an s60 the maxima was rated marginal i was all set to buy my first bmw a 330ci then i met the dealer no dealing you pay out the nose and thats it wow i didnt realize there was just one bmw dealer in north america dave sounds like infiniti dealerships after the g35 first came out i was all set to buy my first bmw a 330ci then i met the dealer no dealing you pay out the nose and thats it i had the opposite experience the moment i inquired about the g35 6mt the local infiniti dealer told me right of the bat that they werent discounting them off the sticker but they would throw in some mats of course this was back in january before the new 3 hit dealer lots after the test drive i decided to get the old 325i lol dave i went to many dealers infiniti and bmws and just found the infiniti dealers more willing to give in of course i had consumer reports buyers guide with me which really helped in the negotiations i liked the feel of the bmw 330ci a littel better than the g coup but it was not worth 7000 the feel of the g was great as well besides almost all of my driving is freeway so i just might check out the acure tl again shades the mustang gt has 300 hp and only costs 25000 the lotus elise has only a 4 cyl 190 hp engine yet costs 43000 which would you rather drive it depends if my msrp cutoff is 30000 or 45000 id rather have the mustang at least it has 4 seats 44 sec 060 106 g skidpad oh and a convertible of sorts  in which case i think it should be compared to the 30k mustang gt convertible i gotta pick the elise but then again  where did this question come from on the sedans board b oh yeah this is a sedan site lol btw the tl g35 and bmw are all great cars and we are lucky we can affort them p where did this question come from just making a point about the g35 vs 325i hpvalue discussion blush i very much miss the feel of my 138 hp 318i vs the feel of my new 280 hp 2005 g35x price size and pure hp were the big factors in getting the g35 the power is exhilarating but delivered in a loud and raw manner however the connection with the road is simply not there i suspect part of it has to do with the slightly larger body of the g35 vs the smaller more agile body of my old 318i\\nill probably

fairness this is the entry level luxury performance sedan boards where the emphasis is on the sportperformance and less on the luxury i saw the new 3 on the road for the first time today not a bad looking car especially from the front the first adjective that came into my mind was pudgy mainly compared to the 2005 3 though i have testdriven about 14 different cars and i am starting to get a feel for the differences between them if we are talking about the infinit g35 versus the acura tl versus the bmw 3 series i have these comments acura has the largest interior think honda accord sized interior then the infiniti think civic sized interior then the bmw which feels cramped think excel sized\\ninterior the bmw 3 series has the best interior design then its a tossup between the infiniti and the acura the infiniti has the best acceleration the bmw 3 series comes next with its high low end torque the acura it right on its heels and the bmw 325 series really isnt in this category when it comes to performance the bmw feels like a higher hptorque car than the numbers would indicate but it is still not as powerful as the infiniti and loses out to the acura at higher speeds however the low end torque really does make a big difference in how the car feels the bmw has the most responsive handling followed closely by the infiniti and the acura trails having the most luxury feel of the three the acura has the best nav system the other two suck the g35s have intellikey technology which means that you never have to take the key out of your pocket as long as the key is your pocket you can open the doors and start the engine makes it pretty tough to get carjacked all three of them sell for about invoice in the washington dc area the infinitis sell for slightly below invoice the acuras for slightly above invoice and the bmws are currently selling for around invoice mainly because bmw has announced a minor midyear redesign they are adding the intellikey technology of the g35 and improving their worst of class nav system if the nav system and the keyless technology isnt important to you then you may be able to get a good deal on a bmw after they start shipping the new bmws with intellikey technology and upgraded nav system btw get internet quotes before you ever step on a lot and see if anyone will beat them i have had trouble getting anyone to beat the lowest internet quotes actually i havent been able to do it yet the bmws have keyless entry and starting as well all you have to do is pay for it the bmw feels like a higher hptorque car than the numbers would indicate but it is still not as powerful as the infiniti and loses out to the acura at higher speeds at what speeds are you talking about the bmw will go right to 155 its really hard to judge relative speeds unless you take them to the track i have not driven the new e90 yet so i cant comment on it performance  power  handling\\nanything else to add or rate performance  power  handling\\nanything else to add or rate performance  power handling tranny nvh tach operation ride on different types of roads seating position sightlines the g35s manual has a light that blinks when the car wants you to shift the tach lacks a redline too nvh from the engine is unparalleled in this classthe 35 is one rough engine seating is high and more like being on a couch thus making the driving experience less thab pleasurable on uneven roads the car tracks poorly and makes a lot of racket with the 18s and 19s vision from the driver seat is good lots of power the keyless system in the new 3 sounds a bit silly to me it requires you to insert the keyfob into a slot in the dash then push a button this isnt the way it operates read the threads on the e90 forum there are also some links to the operation of the keyfob directly to bmwusacom that state you do not have to insert the keyfob this is part of the comfort access package the keyless system in the new 3 sounds a bit silly to me it requires you to insert the keyfob into a slot in the dash then push a button tto avoid disinformation the keyless system when you have comfort access works exactly like mb and infinitiwalk up open door press start key leave key in pocket or purse ill consider thison my e90 for one reason im lazy i hate the idea of the nonkeyless which involves inserting the fob and then pressing that dumb start button in my search for a new car i am truely amazed how many great cars are out there cars i have done research include infiniti acura bmw audi mb lexus saab subaru ford mustang avalon and corvette sort of really and amazing assortment of great cars shades i strongly agree with you especially when you think of how much the japanese luxury brands have improvedincreased their badge appeal from 10 yrs ago i have to say you were right from your other post the germans must be losing a little bit of sleep so the standard system requires you to insert the fob in a slot and the optional system which isnt available yet does not require you to insert the fob in a slot what else is part of this comfort access package thatll be available later what else is part of this comfort access package thatll be available later i believe thats it someone else may know for sure for me its worth 500 to never have to turn a key or even reach for my key when approaching the car they should be losing sleep\\nbut all press and us portray german cars as high quality reliable powerfull and good value but theyre not overall i agree with you that the german cars are not as reliable as the japanese cars in general but they do have high quality and powerful cars however the japanese cars offer more value i am sure the germans are losing sleep in the last few years germans really drive their smallengined cars on the road at high speeds until it is time to stop for gas their cars need to be geared for decent mileage while cruising at triple digit speeds even a pedestrian volkswagon passat will run all day at 120\\njapan is a parking lot traffic moves at a manhattan pace over most of their islands people take the train which is the fast and efficient to get anywhere the japanese do place an extreme priority on image  so their cars look futuristic have great numbers and state of the art electronic bells and whistles but for high speed driving feel the germans have them beat\\nanyone want to jump on this grenade the japanese know the american market very well thats why they build different cars for different countries for example the accord in japan is smaller than the american model thats why japanese hybrids are doing so great american auto makers fought higher fuel efficiency by lobbying congress and the prez japan gave us state of the art hybrids that a selling like crazy german auto makers if not losing sleep should be p german auto makers if not losing sleep should be why they are selling strong and those that like german cars immediately see a difference between what they favor and what they deny japanese cars germanys not in any danger now american companiestheyre going where they belong agreed the new 5 is leading the class in sales so in this one case using sales figures to make a point the germans must be doing something right its going to take a few months to see what the market thinks of the new 3 series im sure 3 series sales figures will be red hot as well the 06 3 series is an impressive machine though german automakers reliability are arguably lagging behind the japanese  they still have badge appeal over infiniti and acura my mom couldnt tell the difference between a tl or g35 but she could probably point out a benz or beemer i would like to see sales numbers i am sure many g35 buyers tested bmws and many tl owners tested bmws i did not long ago the bmw 3 series owned this market not now in terms of market share i doubt bmw is as dominant as it once was however what i have read is that this class of cars is red hot in sales the 3 series doesnt own the market it ceased to own the market for quite a few years after its first competitor emerged however it is the benchmark in terms of the driving experience bmw car sales in the us were down 9 thru april 60k in 2004 vs 55k in 2005 thats all models sales were up worldwide and april sales of the 3 series worldwide were up 17 bmw is still strong in europe where i think only lexus of the japanese luxury brands is available please correct me if im wrong acura tl  tsx sales were up slightly 34k to 36k with the tl flat and tsx up a lot g35 sales were flat lexus overall car sales were down 2 in 2005 vs 2004 with es down over 15 and is down 47 otoh the new gs300 was up over 300 bmws feeling the heat shown in design\\nfirst i remember hearing volvo as box on wheels\\nbut if you noticed and look at pre 1999 bmws\\ni think box on wheels was a tough race to call between volvos and bmw 3s\\nthen redesign of 3 series  1998\\nthen 7 series2002 but i think this and aztec competed for uglist car on the road\\nit looks like a 3 is trying to hatch out of the 7 series trunk alien style\\nthen idrive i am thinking these design changes are an attempt at product differentiation in a more competitive market you gotta wonder why bmw even bothered with this insert the fob into the slot idea i bet this comfort access becomes standard for the 2007 model bmw is still sales leader in this category in may bmw sold 8185 3 series sedans\\nthe tl was second at 7032 in may bmw sold 8185 3 series sedans\\nthe tl was second at 7032 thats my point without tl competition how many tl owners would have bought bmws 10 years ago i think many market share is the point and bmw no longer dominates like it used to the bmw label means a lot to many but acura and infiniti are cutting into bmws sales but acura and infiniti are cutting into bmws sales of course thats the way the market works im sure the new 3series will also take sales from acura and infiniti so why is a 184 hp bmw valued at 30k compared to a 298hp g35\\nwhy would someone pay 30k for 184hp when they can get 298hp for equal price\\nwhy should anyone pay more inefficient german manufacturing process and costlier labor paying more doesnt always mean you are getting a better product well the sales numbers indicate the contrary people believe they are getting something thats more than horsepower to a lot of people the horsepower and the commesurate gas usage are not a big draw or else the 298 hp model would rule the roost so why do you think people buy into this 1 status\\n2 performance id be willing to bet that 75 of the bmw drivers couldnt tell the difference between the driving dynamics of their 3 series and the fwd acura tl they bought the bimmer because 1 its cool 2 their neighborfriendrelative has one 3 it has more cachet than the japanese competition 4 its a sign that theyve made it theres no economic rationale to buy a bmw over a tl or a g35 lets face it most of us spend most of our driving time just getting from point a to point b all three of these will do that in comfort luxury and at speeds well above the legal limits to continue your argument there is no rational reason to buy a tl over a fully equipped accord or even a hyundai youve decided the line in the sand is the tl or g35 if you drove lets say an e46 and tl back to back you would find an amazing difference if you are an enthusiast who can drive a car there are people who cant tell the difference between a gt3 and a 20 year old yugo these people are not the people that i would include in this conversation ifs funny you think a person buys a bmw for status and performance why do people buy a tl or r made by acura the upscale division of honda maybe for status and performance if there is no economic reason to buy a bmw over a tl or g35 there is just no justification for buying any of these cars for they are all overpriced compared to other reliable vehicles to get you from point a to b 3 series must have led in may due to the redesign tl being second since its latest incarnation was in 03 and lastly the g35 with its current version released in 02 i think its safe to say the is250350 will be right up there as well when it comes out this fall theres a certain appeal to being the first one to own or one of the first to drive any auto manufacturers redesign i agree\\ni wouldnt consider myself an expert of any sort but even i noted a definite difference between driving the 06 3 series and a g35never drove a tl  but i did drive my aunts 04 accord sedan which is the same as a tl just kidding frisconick if there is no economic reason to buy a bmw over a tl or g35 there is just no justification for buying any of these cars you are absolutely right but people dont always make rational economic decisions thus we are blessed with abundant choices of transportation reread my post i didnt say there wasnt a difference between the cars i opined that most drivers and even most drivers of these particular cars couldnt tell the difference clearly this forum is populated by driving enthusiasts most of whom can and thus we debate the merits of these cars endlessly with no one changing anyone elses opinion i opined that most drivers and even most drivers of these particular cars couldnt tell the difference i disagree most people cant tell the difference i believe most people can tell the difference but there are individual reasons for getting one car over another we can debate these reasons the monthly sales figures for the tl and 3 series combined is maybe about 15000 there are 15000 individual reasons of why one was chosen over another i can only tell you why i chose bmw the other 14999 reasons well either have to make up or guess sep 2003 330i only 720 units sold\\noct 2003 330i only 754 units sold\\noct 2004 330i only 844 units sold\\nmay 2005 330i only 543 units sold\\nthe new 330i only 1990 units sold you can add the awd too mind you sedan only running an average speed of 87 from sf to san diego i got over 30 mpg in my e46 many people simply refuse to believe it it does fly in the face of physics that a car running 100 mph can get 2930 mpg \\n50 mph  3134mpg\\n6575 mph  3640mph\\n90100 mph   45 i believe you p agree\\ni am adding press and label\\nbecause its not performance at a track g35 will beat a bmw 325\\nnow feel thats complete opinion i like the way infinities feel\\nyou can only drivefeel 1 car at a time\\nonce you buy a car you liveenjoy the feel for the life of ownership\\nthere is not a differentiating daily comparison during the life of ownership\\nunless you own both 3 and g35 and drive both and compare everyday who can tell and i know a g35 is a darn enjoyable ride the 35 l 298 hp engine sounds better when pushed compared to a smaller 25 liter thats a daily reminder for the power you have why do people buy a tl \\nbecause accord is too damned ugly insert a key into the ignition and turn the key insert the fob into the slot push the botton whats the diff and who cares the driving is the thing no even if you dont add coupeconvertiblewagon numbers the 3 series sedan was still the sales leader in this category with 8175 units sold in may obviously someone like blueguydotcom cares i would care as well so does bmw or else they wouldnt offer the smart access package these are sports sedans with some luxury luxury means the little things driving is not the only thing if so why bother with a stereo leather power seats power windows ac etc thats my point without tl competition how many tl owners would have bought bmws 10 years ago i think many market share is the point and bmw no longer dominates like it used to the bmw label means a lot to many but acura and infiniti are cutting into bmws sales no way the kind of person that likes the current tl would have turned his nose up at the far more spartan and crude e36 3 series i believe most people select cars based on appearance and reputation in that order most people never drive their cars hard enough to tell the difference between these cars from a performance perspective i owned a 2001 325ci and i will be picking up my new g35 6 speed friday the bmw handles better but only at the limit i also have a bmw z3 30i and a miata the miata autocrosses better than any of my other cars i speed up for turns\\ni would probably have purchased the accura tl if it had rear wheel drive i think its the best looking of the three cars unfortunately although ive owned some front wheel drive cars i find them very unsatisfyining to drive near the limit too much understeer in the corners and torque steer during acceleration\\nthe infiniti blessed with rear wheel drive is only a little behind the accura tl in appearance and well ahead of the bmw 3 series when the last bmw generation came out i couldnt order one fast enough the new style leaves me cold additionally to get comparable performance from a bmw id need to get the 30 engine and spend a whole lot more than for the infiniti\\nwhen i test drive a car i usually scare the salesperson and ive tried all three cars i like them all in different ways but when it came down to my personal tastes the infiniti was the best all around package for me unfortunately infiniti makes very few 12 6 speeds so ive had to wait almost two months for my special order\\nall three of these cars are excellent vehicles you will enjoy whatever you select cool someone agrees\\nadditionally to get comparable performance from a bmw id need to get the 30 engine and spend a whole lot more than for the infiniti most people never drive their cars hard enough to tell the difference between these cars from a performance perspective your point is well taken and bmw has a broad market its attempting to satisfy however my point is that when one adds up the attributes of an infinity audi and a bmw before making the determination about which to buy it would seem that the entry system would rank rather low when compared to the vehicles actual performance on the road if we were all to forget about the valueprice factor which car would you really buy or would have bought if the tl 3 series and g35 were all priced at 30k w all the bells and whistles then it would come down to pure driving experience wouldnt it personally i went with the g35 mainly for the driving dyamics and that the base 06 beemer didnt even have power seats moonroof standard but no power seats even on the drivers side if they were priced the same though id have to say im 51g35 49bmw anyone else but i did drive my aunts 04 accord sedan which is the same as a tl just kidding frisconick lol for example the accord in japan is smaller than the american model in fact the japaneseeuropean accord is what is sold here as the acura tsx and i was considering that car before i decided instead on my bmw 325i but im still looking at it as a good possibility for my wifes next car i think that the main reason for us and elsewhere bmw sales being down in the early months of this year has a simple explanation the 3 series is far and away the biggest seller for bmw  a large percentage of their sales and since at least the first of the year if not sooner everyone who knows anything about bmws has known that the new car would be out in the aprilmay timeframe so the sales downturn was probably due in a large part to people waiting for the e90 to come out the reduced sales might continue for a while yet as others wait for the other versions of the e90 to start arriving here the 325 ix models etc once bmw gets the full range of e90s into production and on the lots i would guess that their sales will be right back on target i would certainly pick the bmw if all had the same equipment at the same price but they dont i posted this in another forum i test drove the 325 and the 330 yesterday and they were excellent vehicles i really dont think i would want to be in any other car when im approaching a sharp turn at high speeds however i doubt ill be driving that way most of the time especially since its my car also pricing does mean something to me i configured the 325 and the g35 on their websites similarly equipped the msrp for the 325 was 40400 and for the g was 35800 a price difference of 4600 the bmw does have bluetooth which is important to me however i dont know i can justify the price difference to myself especially knowing i can deal significantly on the g35 i expect the real world price difference between these vehicles would be close to 67 k after the deals were done does anyone know if there will be any changes to the 2006 gs will bluetooth be available i configured both cars with most options except nav system oh come on get her a tl its fun but silly to think about what youd buy if all cars cost the same and had the same features might as well consider what youd buy if all cars had the same handling and performance certainly the 3 series would be at the bottom of your list bc its the smallest of the 3 and cost the most if they all performed the same id think the tl would have to be the main choice bc its fwd is better on wet roads and its navigation is 2nd only to the infiniti m if they all performed the same id think the tl would have to be the main choice bc its fwd is better on wet roads and its navigation is 2nd only to the infiniti m ummm i think not if anything the tl is the worst of the three on wet roads why its fwd related torque steer which is only a problem at the highest of power settings on dry roads becomes and absolute nightmare when accelerating from a stop and turning at the same time or when acceleratingclimbing a hill on a curve no thanks give me rwd any day best regards\\nshipo i bought a bmw 3 recently for no other reasons than 147i want a bmw148 i really don146t care if a tl or a g35 is a better car or not i drive a bmw i bought my 325i in january because i bought a 318ti back in august of 1995 ten years on and that ti still drives like new over those ten years it had one mechanical failure the ignition switch went bad apart from the usual wearandtear items batteries tires etc i hated the idea of trading it in so much that i put off buying a new car for as long as i could then it hit me buy a new car and dont trade in the ti i came close to buying a mb c230 late last year but the deal fell through i looked at the g35 but they told me the manuals wouldnt be out until february i considered the is300 but no dealers in my area had any manuals in stock and none of them had any on order nor were they planning on adding any to their inventory ever the acura and audi are fwd the bmw was pretty much the only choice id gone seven years without a car payment now i have two bmws and i still dont have a car payment besides the 3series isnt a rebadged 350z or accord and the is300s tail looks an awful lot like a corolla to me new to the forum but heres my opinion\\nrecently i had a chance to drive the bmw 330i acura tl and g35 it was in a large parking lot with acres of cones set up\\nwe had a chance to drive them as hard as we wanted backtobacktoback several times\\nnow ill preface this by saying i know that you are not going to hop off the interstate only to find yourself in a 300 ft slalom through cones leading into a 180degree hairpin but\\nthe tls front end could not be controlled i couldnt dive into a corner and accelerate out otherwise a few cones would find themselves lodged underneath the front end sure the interior was nice and it was a rather large car\\nthe g35 was powerful takeoff speed was great but when it came to turning the car backandforth the body roll was horrible it took a few laps just to be able to predict where the thing was going to straighten up and hopefully hit the right line\\nthat is what i loved about the bmw 330i it was predictable precise i was always in control the power was there the handling was there steering was tighter  it was a better allaround car in that situation\\ngranted when we took them on the interstate all felt solid at 80mph\\nso a lot will have to do with looks and price im sure but one thing not being taken into account here is maintenance\\nsure the japanese cars which lets face it are hondas and nissans will not cost as much to maintain but bmws is free anyway i think you have to figure that in when you are doing price comparisons\\nany response is appreciated and ive really enjoyed reading everyones opinion during the last few days came close to buying 06 325i but went with a rebadged 350z wfour doors and sure i was aware of the fact that part of the benefits of driving a bmw is being able to say i drive a bmw but after a couple test drives went with the g35 which arguably according to some magazines surpassed the previous generation 3 series in driving dynamics ultimately its an individual choice i used to drive a rebadged toyota camry before the g35 and ive never mistaken a corolla for an is300 i wish i would have been there\\njust like everyone has an opinion with a cars exterior design interior appointments etc driving dyamics can be quite subjective as well\\nive driven both a 325i and g35 and the difference in the handling is quite striking but unlike you ive never driven them through acres of cones  i guess what im trying to say is that as far as comparisons go motor trend cd edmunds have endless resources when it comes to testing every aspect of a car but yet they come up with different conlusions i was somewhat steered by the fact that it seemed like most magazines favored the g35 over the previous generation 3 seriesbut in contrast to that edmunds did a comparo a few years ago where a previous generation 03 tl s type beat the 03 g35 i was somewhat steered by the fact that it seemed like most magazines favored the g35 over the previous generation 3 series\\ni would agree the e46 certainly lacked the power and overall room of the g35 plus the g35 certainly would attract the eye more than say a 325i\\nyet some folks like and always will like the lowkey styling of the e46 i still love the styling of the early90s coupe any body have an input on their experience especially in drivinghandling with the 6mt i am looking at bmw325i but some how my eye get drawn to the mbeven though i know the recent rep for quality is not good i really dont care if a tl or a g35 is a better car or not i drive a bmw i dont so im probably not worthy your statement however is part of the reason when i drove both they handled better than you could ever resonably push them on the street anywayboth are great driving cars that you have to nit pick apart as it isthe thing is the bmw doesnt accelerate hard enough to really excite meand lets face it you can stomp on it when you pass on the highway or on entrance ramps alot more often then you will ever safely test its handling limitsin this respect the infinity is a great choice i have to second thati have driven a 325i and a tl back to back through cones and that alone put me off of the tl i just couldnt use any power in corners i thought even the fwd 93 was significantly better in this respect now most people dont care about this degree of atthelimit handling and if it handles an entrance ramp hard its fine so for them the tl is probably better j i was just joshn with those rebadge comments if it wasnt for a timing issue id probably be driving a g35 coupe 6mt right now i certainly dont think theres anything wrong with picking the g35 its a superb automobile if youre happy with it thats all that matters the is300 is also a worthy car i wouldnt seriously criticize anyone for choosing any of these cars by the way i didnt buy either bmw because theyre bmws that was somebody else i bought them because i thought they were the best cars that fit my needs at the time i bought them and sure i was aware of the fact that part of the benefits of driving a bmw is being able to say i drive a bmw not a benefit in my eyes the worst part of owning a bmwthat damned name and logo on the car i was somewhat steered by the fact that it seemed like most magazines favored the g35 over the previous generation 3 seriesbut in contrast to that edmunds did a comparo a few years ago where a previous generation 03 tl s type beat the 03 g35 why were you steered by other peoples opinions regardless the g35 when pressed to the edge will snap were not talking a little oversteerthe car will sawp ends rather suddenly i know because it happened to me the editor here on edmunds mentioned on his board that he had that happen to him too other mags bring it up and then move on as if its no big deal maybe i push my cars harder than most but i dont like the idea of a car hopping or skipping sideways on my suddenly maybe i push my cars harder than most but i dont like the idea of a car hopping or skipping sideways on my suddenly hehe i was always told that if i didnt occasionally get the car i was driving to swap ends i wasnt driving hard enough  best regards\\nshipo as a matter of fact i test drove one back in november i thought the handling was fine not as soft as i was lead to believe but quite comfortable id add that the 6mt is a must i also drove an automatic and there was a noticeable lag coming off the line that simply wasnt detectable with the manual as far as quality the quality is fine its the reliability thats being questioned as far as that goes you might want to skip on the bellsandwhistles they just increase the number of things that can go wrong oh and the shifting was smooth and precise  better than any of the others i was testing at the time is that the coupe or the sedan that swaps ends cr said it fishtailed but they only tested the sedan if the coupe swaps ends i dont want it surprise that is precisely why most if not all highperformance sports cars and virtually all race cars are rwd there is no getting around the sheer physics of weight transfer any manufacturer with any serious pretense of producing a high performance vehicle will do so in rwdthus there are no fwd porsches or ferraris why were you steered by other peoples opinions  i didnt say i was steered by other peoples opinions  i stated that i referred to magazinespublications that most would consider as reliable or even expert sourcesopinions id like to think i did adequate research as i once again stated in my post  opinions vary  even those of these so called experts i had a consumer reports subscription if i listened to them id be driving a tl if i listened to edmunds id be driving a bmw\\nconsumer reports addressed the handling concerns you mentioned but at the same time it was also a motor trend car of the yeareven with the handling concerns so ultimately i gathered the research i performed  test drove some cars and purchased the car i thought was the best balance between value  performance and comfort i remember my impressions of these three cars during the lexus driving event i attended last year they had an autocross of sorts set up and i was able to aggressively drive the tl 330i e46 and g35 back to back as i recall my impressions were that the tl was too soft no surprise the body roll was pronounced and the car pushed through corners like the nose heavy allseason tire wearing car that it was it does have a fine interior though next the 330i nonsp the bmw had the best ridehandling compromise of the three but it too felt soft when pushed hard through the corners it didnt understeer as much as the tl but it still pushed at the limit and the body roll was significant enough for me to be turned off with auto transmission it was also the dog of the group finally i was most impressed with the g35 it was the sports car of the bunch it had the most powerful acceleration and strongest feeling motor and the suspension was firm just right for me its remarkable that a car this large and heavy can feel so light and tossable body motions were well controlled and the car was easy to steer with throttle i do know however from a nottoorecent test drive that its freeway ride is the harshest of the bunch its interior though improved last year still strikes me as cheap and contrived if i had to choose one as a daily driver id have to take th middle road and say the bmw has the best compromise of the group soft enough to be comfortable on trips but firm enough to have fun with certainly closer to ideal with the sport package and 3 pedals if the e90 is an improvement its likely a fine driver though too bloated for my tastes just my 002 im flying down to orange county ca tomorrow morning finally to pick up my new 325i im as excited as a school kid on a snow day fedlawman bmw 3series sedans  2005 and earlier 28584 29 may 2005 1151 pm i enjoyed your comments i envy your opportunity to beat them up on a closed course when i test drove each of these three cars i couldn146t drive any of them fast enough on the 147back roads148 to test their limits and all three felt rock solid on the highway did the bmw have the performance package when i drove the g35 i did not experience any excessive body roll i drove the stick which comes standard with the sport suspension was your g35 a stick or an automatic if an automatic did it have the sport suspension considering the high limits of all these cars did you notice such a pronounced difference among them when driven at 70 80 of their limit best wishes with your bmw as i stated i owned a 325ci and currently own a bmw z3 30i ive been a member of the bmw car club of america for 6 years and was the massachusetts state representative for the bmw z series club for 2 years i love my z3 and i will continue to take it on long country top down drives this summer it was a tough decision for me to not get a new bmw 3 series and go with the g35 but the infiniti suited me for personal reasons as i also said before these are all great cars and you can be happy with any of them without needing to disparage the others have fun with your bmw are you going to drop an m3 engine in there fed i imagine the coupe does it too  same basic car  but it was a sedan that did some weird stuff on me also a sedan that flipped around on edmunds editor karl at the same time it was also a motor trend car of the yeareven with the handling concerns mt cotylike the ford thunderbird that award when tracked over 20 years is hardly an indicator of quality or decent engineering i like the g35 a whole bunch but having a stamp of approval from mt is hardly worth mentioning i dont so im probably not worthy you should always be proud of whatever you drive i also drive a passat wagon on weekends carring my family shopping and visiting friends thanks blueguy i thought coupe was shorter and this would make it a more stable car even though my prior car was an mt coty winner chrysler 300m i gotta agree its really isnt that prestigious indeed i believe such classics as the chevy vega renault alliance and chevy malibu have shared that award i seem to remember that the chrysler k car andor the omnihorizon were coty winners as well p best regards\\nshipo geezmy point was that car handlingetc can be quite subjective as well not that the coty meant that the g35 was the best car ever i even pointed out that edmunds rated an or tl s type ahead of an 03 g35 it seems to me if the coty went to the g35 the coty has improved the g35 is a great car my not worthy comment was meant to preempt those who would point out that those who dont drive one shouldnt comment im gradually coming to understand that ill likely end up with a bmw given that i want a reasonably well appointed car with a manual transmission  a folddown rear seat conflicted you bet those who own one because its a bmw drive me to distraction fortunately many on edmunds dont fall into that category much as mark of audi fame was able to grow into an asian vehicle ive been learning that bmws arent always driven by the statusseeking people ive learned to avoid in the rest of my life now im watching the longterm reliability thing for those of us who buy and hold latching onto a 23 year old vehicle offlease appears to be the way to go your comments echo my own feelings of seven years ago back then i was a happy 1995 vr6 passat glx 5speed driver and was looking forward to getting a 1999 passat with the same basic features as my 1995 plus a couple of extra goodies like power memory seats climate control and automatic wipers as fortune would have it the 1998 passat glx was equipped exactly as i wanted my next car to be equipped then came the 1999 model year bzzzt im sorry that is incorrect why vw in their infinite wisdom discontinued the 5speed manual for that model year and that model year only why beats the willies out of me as i refused to yield on my combination of a manual transmission and at the very least the power seats i was valet parking two to three times a week at that time and yikes can a parking valet screw up a perfectly positioned manual seat and climate control i hate fiddling with the controls every time the sun goes behind a cloud in the summer time so with the above in mind that left the following cars\\n infiniti i30nissan maxima twins ugly and mushy suspensions compared to my passat\\n audi a4 too small in the back seat area  two kids in car seats you know\\n saab 93 local dealer refused to order me one with a 5speed\\n volvo s70 same dealer as the saab and the same attitude regarding the 5speed\\n bmw 528i too slow couldnt afford the 540i and ewwww that bmw stigma\\n bmw 328i a little smaller inside than the 1999 passat but otherwise just about perfect excepting of course for that same bmw stigma with all of that said once i drove the 328i i was hooked nuthin and i do mean nuthin even came close so stigma be damned ive been driving bmws ever since best regards\\nshipo ok now edmunds has done it why in the world would they compare a a4 20t to a 330i totally ridiculous of course the 330i would win that contest quite easily m those who own one because its a bmw drive me to distraction they drive me bonkers a girl at a party came up to me and said i have a bmw too i asked what model she blinked blinked again its a bmw the little one ah yes the typical southern california bmw owner my peersgolly how lucky i am it could be worse i could own a hummer ok now edmunds has done it why in the world would they compare a a4 20t to a 330i totally ridiculous of course the 330i would win that contest quite easily did you actually read the article they clearly state that audi sent them the the sportiest a4 made audi doesnt make a manual a4 with the v6 audi knew going in that their top a4 in performance wasnt the v6 model kinda sad when you think about it their a3 wih a dsg is a better performing car btw what the blazes is wrong with edmunds test drivers everybody and their mother is getting low 6s for the a3 dsg edmunds gets close to 7 seconds then they get a 66 with a 330i the cars far more powerful than my old school e46 with performance package ive driven e90s and theyre better in every way  a car that scampered to 60 in under 6 seconds somethings totally off with their testing yeah i read it they should have just compared both 6cylinders with automatics or probably not at all doesnt make any sense to me a turbo 4 vs the industry standard i6 no way either way audi dropping the manualv6 combo is a mistake if mercedes can offer a manual in the c350 m 2006 bmw 330i vs 2005 audi a4 comparison test in addition to continuing the conversation here feel free to drop by karls daily log book and discuss your reactions directly with karl brauer editor in chief of edmundscom i see bluyguys already there are you going to drop an m3 engine in there fed after spending the whole day yesterday driving it i think a jc chip will be enough for me next to my miata this is the best performing car ive ever owned and a thrill to drive  just the way it is believe it or not \\nthe e46 with a performance package and manual transmission could go 060 in 59 sec the 060 time of an e90 with a manual transmission can hit 61 sec\\nweird believe it or not \\nthe e46 with a performance package and manual transmission could go 060 in 59 sec the 060 time of an e90 with a manual transmission can hit 61 sec\\nweird i dont believe it not for a second can someone explain whats wrong with bmw stigma whats wrong with loving the car simply because it bears some specific name look i understand if you drive bmw and do not even know what model is that you are driving like the girl in blueguydotcoms example  those people simply do not deserve to drive this great vehicle on a contrary i know my car in and out i understand exactly what i am driving but at the same time when i decided that i am buying a new car i had no doubt about the make and the thing because it is bmw was my main reason simply because i always liked this car i always wanted this car i always respected this car and even people who are driving this car simply because for me bmw is a symbol symbol of something positive symbol of me achieved something for just 13 years living in usa something that i would never be able to achieve in my native country doing things legally i hope you understand what i am trying to say\\nso whats wrong with loving bmw just because it is bmw\\nmike its true\\nof course this is based on factory specs as long as your nose is level with the ground about it the stigma that i was referring to and what i objected to is sort of two separate parts 1 the poseurs who buy a bmw to make a statement but have no ideainclination on how to actually drive the damn thing\\n2 the slash  burn drivers which in days gone by were often exemplified by someone in a bmw slicing his or her way down a crowded roadway cutting off folks with blatant disregard for anybody but themselves from my perspective you cannot do anything about stigma 1 it is what it is and now with the advent of the japanese luxury brands the bmw poseur thing has been reasonably diluted as for the stigma 2 folks that too seems to have been a bit diluted in recent years with the advent of slammed hondas neons and gallants that many gear heads seem to be fond of at this point now seven years after i initially went through the process of convincing myself to even consider driving a bmw i dont even give it a second thought i have really liked my two bmws and it is surely going to take one hell of an amazing car from some other marque for me seriously look elsewhere best regards\\nshipo i was incredibly nervous about buying mine as a matter of fact i delayed my purchase over a year because i wanted bmw  the car  but didnt want bmw  the name i live in a pretty rural mostly farming area there is not much money at least not on display in the area and an early 80s f150 is much more common than anything foreign before i got my car i knew of only one other bmw in our area and it was an old rusting junk pile sitting next to a barn on top of that in my family  immediate aunts uncles cousins etc  im the only person with a college degree so again not too much money floating around i was afraid that by buying the bmw it would be seen as me showing off in local terms getting too big for my britches in hindsight that never materialized i cant believe you guys are even talking about stigmas i like the fact that people admire the care and compliment me on it and asks how it handles that is my stigma with the vehicle people who express jealousy at a bmw probably do the same thing for a big pricey house expensive jewelery expensive clothing etc in other words there are people who dont want you to have more than them why indulge someones jealousy of you if you are 20 years old and image consious you may want to look deep and hard at your values but for people who have been around the block in life who cares what other people think lemon i always wanted this car i always respected this car and even people who are driving this car simply because for me bmw is a symbol symbol of something positive symbol of me achieved something for just 13 years living in usa those reasons are the exact ones i dont want to own a bmw i dont want to be associated with yuppie achievers and wannabes anymore than the association one gets from owning a secretaries car like an eclipse or a the million pejoratives associated with camaromustangvette owners the list goes on and on at least infiniti and acuras tsxtlrl dont suffer from preconceived notionstheyre simply solid nice cars in the 80s and 90s yuppies made bmw a symbol of greed selfishness conspicuous consumption not at hummer levels but close and new wealth the cars abilities have become second to the logo buy one and youre immediately associated with that group of people i recall a really close friend a girl who worked for me and i view like a little sister responded quite simply when i told her i bought a bmw but youre not one of those people yes apparently i am shes an attorney now at a huge law firm and shes making megabucks when asked what shell buy for her next car she responds the same way ill keep my hyundai until the wheels fall off ah but youre an individual and youre not part of that cultureright but the reality is that people treat you differently based on things like the car youre driving or the clothes youre wearing i get 500 more people talking to me when im in the bmw especially girls i dont like that i stop for gas and people talk to me about the car i dont like that other people in bmws think were in some kind of special fraternity and talk to me as if i know them i dont like that a few people i know  people i would not call friends  will ask me which car did you drive tonight what difference does it make they both seat 5 if the car didnt drive the way it does i wouldnt have bought one fought it tooth and nail and now im stuck in some guiltridden angstfilled world where i despise what my car represents to 99 of the world but love the moment i turn the engine on blueguydotcom\\ni can simply say that you are getting physical enjoyment in driving you car but you are not getting moral pleasureenjoyment at all i dont thing you are getting 100 of what you could have please understand  place or car does not make the person it the other way around person makes the place the car yes people have some stereotypes and its hard to change them and you dont have to change them but dont deprive yourself from the enjoyment simply because you think that people associate you with some group of achievers etc\\ni am not a reach guy i am not and never will be a part of them who are reach and play golf on weekend at expansive private golf clubs and if people mistakenly associate me with that group that you despise well there is nothing i can do but at least it will never have any influence on my love to this car and on my enjoyment driving and owning it and if i get more attention and respect from other just because i drive bmw let it be so if i have a chance ill certainly show that i deserve respect for other reasons and not because i drive bmw if i dont have that chance well i cannot change the world but i will not deprive myself from 100 of enjoinment for some selfish reasons\\nit is only my opinion\\nmike least infiniti and acuras tsxtlrl dont suffer from preconceived notions wow are you ever wrong about that the perception is these are the cars that upscale people get when they cant afford a porsche bmw mercedes or lexus  the 060 time of an e90 with a manual transmission can hit 61 sec  its already been tested at 56 wow are you ever wrong about that the perception is these are the cars that upscale people get when they cant afford a porsche bmw mercedes or lexus never have a i met a non bmwaudilexusmb person in ca who expresses something negative about acurainfiniti owners owners of those makes express negative things about acurainfiniti but one can surmise all sorts of reasons why theyd feel the need to lash outprobably closely related to why they bought a car with a 3 point star or a blue and white propellor now caddy bmw mb audi lexus porsche vetteyes often just going by my experience if i thought friends and family were bothered by me buying a bmw my god my parents would outright disown me if i ever muttered the word cadillac never have a i met a non bmwaudilexusmb person in ca who expresses something negative about acurainfiniti owners well ive never had anyone express anything negative to me about bmw owners either i did have one person at work stop talking to me after he saw i had a new 3 series but he was just working through a case of serious toy envy i dont think it would have been different if i had a acura or infiniti but i dont know that for a fact of course i think its silly to buy a bmw because of the badge but you know what people buy bmws mercedes acuras lexus mercurys chevys pontiacs toyotas subarus etc for the badge as well i dont see how this should sway you in any specific direction dave 02 alert\\ni dunno i wanted a sporty reardrive sedan and the 3series was a little too small the 5 series was a little too expensive but the g35 was just right\\ni drove a 545i six speed on the street at a bmw driving experience  and it felt greatnot flogging itjust driving normally yes the idrive was a pain but i sure could get used to it\\nlooked at the 06 3 series the other day still kind of tight but really nice looking a few friends own bmws and they all love them to each their own maybe you asked the wrong question maybe theres a niche market out therehyundai elantra body kits for your bmw for those who enjoy driving bmws but dont want to be mistaken for a guy who knows what zegna is i can afford any car and i asked my wife what car she wants we test drove many cars including porche mb bmw and lexus and she chose the acura tl the last thing on my mind is what others thought although i understand the bmw stigma plus the tl is a great car now its time for me to buy my car p wow youve really thought too long and hard about bmw stigma\\nin the 80s and 90s yuppies made bmw a symbol of greed selfishness conspicuous consumption not at hummer levels but close and new wealth or did hollywood and marketing enterprises do that here in the boston area bmws probably outnumber hyundais very common growing up in one of the wealthiest places on earth without me personally being wealthy prior to moving to the home of the world champion red sox and patriots   i cant ever remember a comment or discussion stigmatizing anyone i knew with a bmw the only converstaions i remember are how much fun they were to drive and how expensive and often they required maintenance or maybe i just care less what other people think its my money my life my choice when someone else wants to buy me a car then ill let them have a say in it i drive an 05 tl could i have bought a 3 5 c or an e yup or even a bentley but then id still have to work long after id passed away but i bought the car i wanted given the parameters i set for myself have i ever heard someone say oh a tl couldnt afford a bmw huh nope i suppose they could be thinking it but then again i dont think i know any of they nor would i care if that is what they were thinking to each if you deny yourself choice simply because of what they may or may not be thinking have fun finding contentment although i often think noncar people are more content hey it gets me there and didnt cost an arm and a leg now im off to my second home in the hamptons after visiting both my kids at harvard and picking up my new patek sorry started rambling enjoy your ride no matter what it is were headed for trouble with this line of conversation im here to tell ya lets get back to the cars that fit this category and forego the observations about personalities who can afford what etc and lets just assume that people choose the vehicle that suits their criteria  whatever those criteria may be  judgement of same not required confuse thanks um yeah thats kinda what i meant pat thanks and now back to our regularly scheduled entrylevel luxury performance sedans discussions enjoying the tl hope to put coat four of zaino on today here in the boston area bmws probably outnumber hyundais very common growing up in one of the wealthiest places on earth without me personally being wealthy prior to moving to the home of the world champion red sox and patriots   i cant ever remember a comment or discussion stigmatizing anyone i knew with a bmw going along with your logic why would the very people who are despised for buying bmws mock the stigma of the car thats like saying you lived among gang bangers and never heard anyone say slammed caddies on bling rims were for punks thats to be expected ya cant swing a dead cat in san diego or granite bay ca my hometown without hitting several bmws ill stick with my theory that most bmw owners are exactly what i described theyre not buying for performance or funtodrive characteristicstheyre buying for socalled prestige as that one guy said to him the bmw says to the world i made it the massive proliferation of steptronic 325s says it all but to each his own still dont think the tlg35 come with a stigma if they do its a stigma of frugality which is hardly a negative thing laurasdada\\nwhy did you choose tl over 325 price wise i think they are more or less the same am i right yes tl is a bit more powerful according to the hours power specs but bmw is a bit more luxury what was you deciding factor\\nmike ps to blueguydotcom yes i made it can barely afford it but still made it and proud of it and enjoy every second behind the wheel with the shiny bmw logo in its center bentley yes i can afford a bentley but i dont like them i gravitate to japanese cars over european cars i feel japanese cars are better made and have better styling just a personal opinion but i must say i do like bmws both handling and style additionally mb styling is bold and outstanding but they have reliability problems reliability is very important to me you can afford bentley what do you do for living\\nabout reliability i still dont understandwhy people say that bmw and mb are not very reliable i ma not familiar with official statistics but i tell you that before i drove mitsubishi galant and i also heard a lot of non reliable comments about this brand of cars at that time 1997 it was the only car i could afford to buy new and i must say it behaved perfect with regular normal care for the car i did not have any real problems so my suspicion is that maybe it is just a few individual who unfortunately had some problems with mb andor bmw and made a big deal out of it am i wrong or someone has reliable official statistics about it\\nmike we need to get back to the cars and stop generalizing about why people buy them thank you i agree with pat i always agree with pat besides when people start talking about how much money they make and what they can afford i get depressed i get my reliability information from consumer reports they said that the bmw 3 series is reliable the 5 and 7 series are not the mb c clk e and s class were rated unreliable reliability is determined by a survey of 810000 subscribers but ones mans reliable is another mans unreliable id rate my bmw as unreliable as its been to the shop for two problems  broken ebrake from the factory and bad ignition coils im taking it in wednesday for an engine software upgrade others would say that stuff is no big deal so if cr were to contact me theyd hear my car broke down a hardcore fan of a company might say both those things were covered under warranty and arent really indicative of the reliablity shrug apparently based on crs report bmw 5 and 7 drivers are complaining shhh dont tell anyone that the reason i want this discussion to get back on topic is that i cant afford what they are talking about either thanks for your response since ive been monitoring the german boards over the past years ive read many of your posts im on the slippery slope sliding toward the propeller but still have a few years left i hope with my present vehicle while the financially responsible thing to do is to pick up an offlease vehicle ive done a number of business trips to germany and cant think of anything better than driving my own new ed xxx to the places ive learned to love otoh the infiniti m is very interesting so long as im willing to do without the manual and the folddown rear seat oh wait those are the only two things i care about besides something resembling luxury perhaps bmw does know what its doing hello odessit my prefrences are for a luxurysport sedan tl as opposed to sportluxury 325 also as a lifelong skier and denizen of the mountains of vermont new hampster and maine i prefer front wheel drive ill give up the 9 or 1010ths handling advantages of rwd for the traction and packaging of fwd the tl handles very well for my tastes having said that the tires on the base tl are terrible in the snow thatll teach me i considered a 325x330x but i decided i didnt need the added weight and complexity of awd ive gotten along just fine without awd lo these many years in the snowmountains not to mention my new england frugality just wouldnt let me spend so much more for the bmw especially since i knew the 06 were on the way similarly equipped the tl is less money had i really wanted the 3 i would have bought it and im sure loved it but for me the tl was a bertter car and value i also shopped the g35 and mercedes e320  a different animal i know but it is such an appealing car to me again i just didnt see the value proposition of course now with 2020 hindsight and a ne winter behind me a rwd 3 with decent allseasons would probably have better traction than my tl with the bridgestones theyre supposedly allseasons as long as none of the seasons include snow in the snow the best laid plans anyway had i gone with any of the other ellps im sure i would have been just as happy as i am with the tl a wonderful class of cars tough decision you really cant go wrong oh yeah frisconick will you adopt me and buy me an aston martin daddy if u had a choice of these 2 sports sedans which would u pick definitely 330i\\nthis may sound crazy 330i is the better car but is300 exterior is superior imho\\nfyi guys i drive a g35 but i could probably afford a g35 w the nav\\nand i could probably afford an aston martin but id also have to live in it as well and eat only one meal per day im sort of biased toward the bmw i think the question should be is the bmw worth 5k more and if it isnt 5k more then the price of the lexus is too much regards\\nkyfdx ok laurasdada what color do you want p hmmm now frisco did we just form some sort of internet message board formal contract kinda like a verbal contract how bout a nice gunmetal gray ill even help you with your new car dilemma by giving you a good deal on my abyss blue tl once ive got the aston of course now you weren just kiddin me were you dad surprise actually i prefre the tl over the aston why do you want an aston when you have a beutiful abyss blue p look if laurasdada will not take the aston  ill be happy to take it actually i prefer bmw better so instead of one aston id settle for 5 bmws try putting good snow tires on your tl  i did and it made a big difference thanks armand im considering it i know itll make all the difference i think even just getting a better rated in the snow allseason would be an answer with fwd and all the electronics frisco actually id like to keep my tl for daily fun the aston would be for weekend fun why do i want an aston why did i want the tl why does anybody want anything because it would fulfill some need want and desire deep within my innerbeing and chicks would dig me odessit hands off i asked first lol chicks do dig nice cars and bikes i own a hd too  p cars cars that are within our category  thank you this is just like jeopardy could you rephrase your comment within the context of the discusstion title the bmw 3 series  audi a4 comparo was inexcusably bad of course a 330 is going to wipe the floor with with a 20 so whats the point there is absolutely no reason that a supposedly wellrespected automotive magazine shouldnt be unable to scare up two comparable cars for a comparison test whats next a comparison test between a porsche and fiat inside line is wasting our time its almost amazing it seems recent posts support what i tried to post earlier eg 3608 why people buy bmw\\nfinally theres no hesitation to question a bmws value it almost seemed people are afraid to question bmws since its been foolishly jamed into mindsbmws are high performance high quality mostly by magazinespress friendswho like the label and the high price to own\\nbut as these posts say its mostly opinion and actually bmws probably arent worth the high price for similar performance\\none thing i still dont see many people admitting is bmw benzes and audis low reliability and high cost of maintanance i feel this is in the direction of pride no one likes to admit cost paid vs more cost spent to maintain\\nand it is fact bmws do break down more then average\\nconsumeraffairscomnews03jdpowerhtml little old 2003\\nbenz clsdiff class\\n2002\\nand it does cost more once its in shop vs asian us brands of course it depends who drives but when the car is in the shop pull out the wallet one of the biggest problems that i have with folks who like to take issue with owning a bmw is that they like to dwell on the negative by slamming bmw because they are 147unreliable and expensive to maintain148 that line of bilge has been repeated so often that to some at least it has become fact sorry but i have never seen any evidence scientific anecdotal or otherwise to support such a claim the simple truth is that cars all cars are far more reliable now then they have been at anytime in history and bmws are some of the most reliable ahhh buy the naysayers will say oh yeah well just look at the statistics referenced in the above post youll see that toyota has 196pp100 vs bmws 262pp100 rating uhhuh well personally both numbers look pretty damn good to me and furthermore comparing the full north american bmw line all fairly complex performanceluxury cars to the full line of toyotas starting with nolow option strppo econoboxes with far fewer components to fail seems to be a bit disingenuous if you ask me to my way of thinking at least a much more fair comparison would be lexus vs bmw and while i havent seen those numbers in a while if memory serves the gap was much narrower even still the report shows that for every four problems reported by a toyota owner a bmw owner will report roughly five so much for being 147unreliable148 i did find it interesting to note that bmw and a few other european manufacturers were singled out in the following quote 147porsche jaguar saab and bmw perform well above the industry average in dependability\\x85148 as being quite reliable another knock that i continually read about bmws is that they cost a lot of money to maintain that too is pure fabrication the only out of pocket expense a late model bmw owner should experience for the first 50000 miles is tires period full stop the end everything else is covered under the full maintenance program once a car has enough miles andor years to no longer be covered under the maintenance program they seem pretty reasonable to maintain especially given their very long service intervals called for in the owners manual basically change the oil every year or 15000 miles change the brake fluid every two years and the coolant every three or four years iirc as for the scheduled services those occur every 30000 miles and while the cost can range from 600 to over 1000 when you consider the number of miles that cost gets amortized over it just aint that much money said another way my bet is that if you were to do an apples to apples comparison of a new e90 3series vs a new second generation lexus is my bet is that the bmw will cost less money for general maintenance and repair than the lexus for at least the first 100000 miles how much less probably not too much but less is still less me personally im waiting to drive the is and the e90 back to back and ill go with the one i like the best their relative reliability and the cost of maintenance is in my mind at least not a defining issue best regards\\nshipo when you fork out 1000s more one thing you would expect is more reliability the is is the best of the lot in that respect every one has their own story to tell i have not really seen bmw being run down here in fact it is the other way around there is wholesale plagiarizing of hyperbole to describe the bmws as compared to the competition it is as if use of flowery language and the name is enough to make their cup run over reminds of an old chestnut guy buys a bmw and drives it otd car stops 2 miles later owner calls dealer car is inspected there is no engine owner asks how did it drive 2 miles oh that would be the reputation says the dealer usually gets it so far have a nice day folks when you fork out 1000s more one thing you would expect is more reliability the is is the best of the lot in that respect uhhuh so where are the scientific numbers to back your claim up just because i might say car x is the most reliable or the least expensive to drive and maintain doesnt make it so the same thing with what youve written saying it doesnt make it so best regards\\nshipo one thing i still dont see many people admitting is bmw benzes and audis low reliability and high cost of maintanance i feel this is in the direction of pride no one likes to admit cost paid vs more cost spent to maintainand it does cost more once its in shop vs asian us brands  ah but because of the all inclusive 4 yr50k warranty maintaining a bmw comes down to new tires once a year if youre gonna keep the car for more than 34 years then maintenance costs become an issue with any car then again if one buys a gtl you gotta get oil changes tuneups and so forth so for the millionth time  because youre beating a dead horse  total cost to maintain of my 330i  2000 over two years all spent on tires one thing i still dont see many people admitting is bmw benzes and audis low reliability and high cost of maintenance i bought a bmw 318ti in august of 1995 and drove it daily for 912 years putting 112000 miles on the odometer in that time i had one 1 mechanical failure  the ignition switch went out and need to be replaced i think it cost me something like 27500 i forget im sorry but it would be disingenuous for me to confess to reliability problems i havent had im not saying that bmws are problem free no car is its just that reliability ratings can be misleading just because it says that the average maintenance cost of a bmw is x amount of dollars doesnt mean that everyone who buys one is going to wind up spending that amount im sure there is someone out that bought one just like mine that has sworn off bmw forever after the gazillionth trip to the repair shop but im not that guy quit accusing us lying just because we wont reinforce your preconceived notions of german car reliability besides if you look at the numbers closely it appears that the odds of buying a unreliable new car in the us is pretty slim no matter what make you buy actually people are afraid to question the value of a japanese car friend has been a long time acura nut but has been frothing at the mouth due to issues my bmw was in any shop 5 times in 3 years thats the way it should be and i daresay out of my bmw owning friends it is and when they are out of warranty japanese vehicles cost as much to repairmaintain as german can you say 3k for a transmission really cheap my buddys 540 had a tranny issue over 5k later it was replacefixed ouch from what ive heard most automatics when they go bad costs that kinda dough now and people wonder why i run from automatics nother myth people dont understand btw this is another discussion statement\\nfwd vs rwd\\nscca touring car pts standings\\ntop 6 fwd lead points\\n710 fwd lead point standings\\nso you think rwd performs better then fwd\\nfwd cars regularly outperform rwd and were talking prof racing ive tried that argument a number of times its like trying to argue against a religion at some point you wind up talking in circles and convincing nobody of anything well maybe that is because you are wrong it could happen ya know have you been talking to my wife sign up on the bmw web site or call the phone number and see for yourself i drove the e90 330i g35 and a4 32 quattro on a closed course in atlanta last friday i had driven a similar lexus event a year ago told my professional race car driver instructor to tell me to keep it down if i was too aggressive he never said boo  but i figured i was braking at the proper time when his foot hit the passenger floor board at the same time mine went for the brake observations all cars were automatics a4  heavy and understeering must be hammered with tires squealing trusting in the awd to drag you out of corners g35  a beast good power and unforgiving handling transmission drops back to idle when you come off the gas leading to delays in getting the power back down new 330i  an amazingly balanced sport sedan a smoother ride and more room than my 04 active steering on an autocross course was telepathic brakes engine step transmission in sports mode and suspension all in sync did a hot lap with the pro at the wheel  shifted the bmws steptronic transmission manually and left it in second and followed the line  woohoo feed back on my driving  needed to use the full width of the course side to side for the most speed through the cones i also tended to either go full throttle or braking vice a graduated release of the throttle  application of the brakes as the steering input comes in and then the reverse as it comes out a great experience to drive all three cars all out at a slow speed 50ish autocross limit on a 1 mile closed course anyone else done this did bmw x3 a couple of years ago at belmont ny there were no comparo vehicles only x3s on the autocross also locked in 2nd and a real hoot plus super hot frenchcanadien instructor babeother bmws were available for the street loop\\ndid mb mclass last sunday at same localenot as perf oriented as bmw but i flogged cclass very nimble but not much power\\nwill sign up for bmw at shea stadium in septi hope i can flog a g35 and then a 330i sounds like a blast can146t yet compare preidrive bmw reliability with the current generation for one thing those with the japanesecar mentality need their consumer reports red dots they avoid german cars like the plague there are a lot of black dots showing up next to bmws these days bmw free maintenance notwithstanding it is an inconvenience to bring the car in for multiple software glitches and such in addition i am not convinced that the service bays have a handle on these problems yet you hear plenty of stories around here about bmw service departments not having a clue what gives with current electronics a colleague of mine has a 7 she loves the car but can146t wait to turn it in off lease because of the electronic issues so yeah it146s nice to have it made in the shade with those luscious older bimmers but in the words of financial disclosures past performance does not guarantee the future the reason i bought my previousgeneration bmw is yesterday146s news since bmw was so hellbent on change i too am changing my criteria for future purchases so you think rwd performs better then fwd\\nfwd cars regularly outperform rwd and were talking prof racing yeah you see lots of indycart racing with fwd too right more than that what is more fun thats the key to me i head out of a corner i love to stomp it and just explode  take that sucker to redline at wot do that in a fwd car and where do you end up not going straight were in entry level performance sedans\\nthats exactly what fits in the scca touring car division\\nand if you noticed in the scca link\\nbmw 325is were 7910 bottom bottom half of top 10 positions the point is fwd acura tsxsmazda 6 outraceoutperform rwd bmw 325i regularly\\nplease youre almost ignorant and ill race you for pink slips in my honda crv then youll find out that equipment isnt the most important thing in winning races the point is fwd acura tsxsmazda 6 outraceoutperform rwd bmw 325i regularly\\nplease youre almost ignorant a avoid ad hominem attacks its uncool b the 325i im not following why the hell would i look at a 325i i hated that car in 03 when i was looking and i still cant find a way to justify buying an e90 version the 50 hp gulf between my 330i zhp and a 325i was way too much to overlook the e46 325i is not a car id want to own additionally id take the following over an e46 325i in the order id pick em a3 20 dsg tsx 6 mt legacy gt 25 5 mt g35 6 mt a4 20 6 mt the car looks cool my only nitpick is i would like to see a lower beltline its styling has it all over e90 inside and out imo cant wait to drive it really im on the other side the interior looks horrible  way too buickylexus like for my taste i like austere cold interiors and im drawn to vwaudibmw for that reason  the harder the angles the better as for the outside the e90 is plain to ugly the is350 is just plain ill take a hint of ugly  makes things more interesting its kinda like a lilly taylor v gwyneth paltrow thing paltrows not offensive she just doesnt have any edge at all weve officially gone over the edge well i like austere interiors too in the ilk of the old porsches and bimmers that146s what i like about the x3 however we146re not going to get that in a lexus the interiors of the new 3 5 and 6 just look cheap imo and they don146t have that functionoverform look as they did in the past i146ll take that buttonedup plush is interior would like to see it in the raw to pass final judgment i hope it doesn146t give me a flat top like the gs does i mean when your head hits the roof it automatically eliminates it from contention i remember that happening with the rx7 i guess to repeat for blind eyes\\nfwd vs rwd\\n325 is rwd\\ntsx is fwd which outperformed many rwds bmw 325\\nwhich is the point of post 3736\\njust to repeat fwd outperform rwd cars but the funny thing is you admit you would not think about gettting bmw 325i\\nwhich is a bmw that many in here are considering vs g35s or others\\nsince to repeat 3608 330 cost too much to be considered nother funny thing you should know is a 325 in racing form\\ndoes not have the same engine or hp as the one youd get from the in factory im not sure why you cant seem to follow\\ndont hate were all lovers not haters haha i hated that car i those with the japanesecar mentality need their consumer reports red dots they avoid german cars like the plague there are a lot of black dots showing up next to bmws these days lol thats me however lets be fair the 3 series got a thumbs up this year fwd outperform rwd cars in this instance you may be correct i dont know enough about the racing situation to say otherwise couple of things that could be factors\\nacura et all needs street creds that bmw already has and doesnt feel the need to through the money into this series if you notice many of the bmws listed in the race series are no longer manufactured please cite proof salaries win loss place on different platforms of the drivers would be a start what a way to build sales beat bmw in such and such situation name a nonhomogolation series where the builder had a choice of rwd vs fwd platform and purpose built a fwd name a make and model of fwd car that is considered a sports car classic there are many japanese rwd classics datsun b2000  z cars to name a few cite championship results name a major race that has been won by a fwd car nonhomogolation please cite the physics behind the reasons that a fwd car is better than a rwd car assume we have a reasonable understanding of mass acceleration yaw etc in general the three series does quite respectable in racing please show us a general trend in the giant world of racing that fwd kicks rwd or bmw is getting whipped by fwd machines in closing i am not contradicting your statement that bmw is getting its tail whipped in the series you cite i am saying in general that you will have a great difficulty proving fwd is better that rwd in high performance situations we are thoughtful and considerate in this community professional ettiquitte is a must and brings out the best in all involved i appreciate the many profesional and constructive responses most of you post you are right within one set of parameters but not within another i fully admit fwd will trump rwd with under 200 hp for it is more efficient but not necessarily more balanced subarus eat fwd cars for lunch at rallys look at the minicooper of course it is a niche vehicle with little use for a family of 4 but it drives great you can take an e90 and drop a v8 in it like the rumored new m3 and then its a different story you will still have a balanced sport sedan that will get to 60 in what 5 or less seconds and do 179 or so without even breathing hard how about dropping a v8 in a tsx and then running it on a racetrack think it will be balanced or it will be able to even keep up with an m3 now im just using that as an example so yes in certain situations fwd may be preferable in certain limited types of racesrallyesevent it may even do very well against rwd vehicles with limited torque and hp try autooninfoorg the pages are updated for my 2004 it is not sponsored by any manufacturer like lexustoyotahondanissaninfinitacura but looks like it is also read the links for sales etc happy reading regards geekay you cant be serious that site is about as useful for determining the reliablilty of late model cars as the basket of green tee leaves that i just accidentally spilled all over my kitchen floor  best regards\\nshipo consumer reports is the most objective analysis of cars consumer reports is the most objective analysis of cars funny even when they agree with my own thumbs up or thumbs down assessment regarding a specific car i still usually disagree with their reasoning as to why they picked it over other similar cars i guess im weird that way  best regards\\nshipo actually cr is not objective it still depends on people returning the filledin surveys i believe that a larger number of respondents will be people with a bone to pick someone who is satisfied with his car has less reason to respond so following that logic i guess more european eg mercedes car owners have bones to pick than asian car owners eg acurahonda perhaps i used to swear by cr now im not so sure i believe any of it id rather roll the dice and follow my heart than follow cool empirical numbers the sound money or logical side says buy a used camcord i cant live that way im already bored to death  cant imagine fretting over the possibility my car might break down and thus end up buying a car that doesnt make me love it or hate it passionately i guess to repeat for blind eyes\\nfwd vs rwd\\n325 is rwd\\ntsx is fwd which outperformed many rwds bmw 325\\nwhich is the point of post 3736\\njust to repeat fwd outperform rwd cars to repeat for you from my original post regarding your gleeful writing about the fwd race cars yeah you see lots of indycart racing with fwd too right more than that what is more fun thats the key to me others have already hit you over the head so its not worth it you cited one race series and acted like its gospel nobody here believes you believe all race cars should be fwd over the years ive become so jaded regarding the cars that cr has recommended that id always prided myself on not ever owning a car that made their thumbs up list then what do you suppose happened the folks over there at cr took a silly pill and waxed enthusiastic all over the e39 530i wouldnt you know it i had just placed an order for that very car i almost cancelled my order almost  best regards\\nshipo of course if you look at the 2004 standings bmw had the top 2 3 of the top 4 and 7 0f the top 11 httpwwwworldchallengecom2004tcstandingshtml i know nothing about this series so i have no idea how much the particular drivers abilities play into their results based on repeated reliability ratings and surveys by different sources cr jd power etc which consistently put lexus infiniti and acura over bmw mb and audi ill take my chances with an out of warranty japanese car in determining my reliability chances with a car i wouldnt put much stock in the very limited sample of whether this friend or that friend had trouble with his japanesegerman car i agree with the choice of your word chances thats what it is you play the percentages ive had superb german sedans and pita japanese sedans ive been a long time reader of cr yet i didnt submit any information about the pita japanese sedans or reliable german sedans they are biased in an objective way that is difficult to measure i wont take any chances with used sedans period as i know people that have been burnt with supposedly reliable makes if i were to buy a used sedan i would take my chances with a be cpo dont think this is neccessary to repeat\\nbut we are in entry level perf seden forum  bmw 325 330 g35 cts tsx\\nwhich race in that series we are talking about entry level perf sedens\\nfwd vs rwd i refer to entry level perf sedens entry level perf sedens entry level perf sedens\\ndo the 330 or 325 fit in any other catagory indy car what on earthforum are you talking about\\ndont think many will drive indy so its not valuable information get your details straight btw will not respond to fwd vs rwd ne more not worth the time the 2004 race standings seem to fit this category when i looked into buying one of these cars i wondered if they were junk and searched high and low it is hard to find hard data from several sources that a car is reliable when you do find data it is usually glossed over cr has the most detailed explanation but counts on volunteer replies you almost have to trust the brand you are buying before you take a dive the one that really gets me is in car mags they never say last years model had serious reliability issues and this is how xyz motors fixed them they only write about the driving experience who cares if it is on of the 10 best if it only works downhill in a tailwind who cares about jd powers 90 day reliability what about 1 year jason kasper i agree about magsedmunds taking a seriously soft approach to reviewing cars theyre essentially doing lightweight reviews and rarely take hardcore swipes at obviously deficient packages the reaction to the la times gm article reveals whymanufacturers expect a kid gloves approach to reviewing new cars btw always amused me how the old awd turbo eclipse was on the 10 best lists in the 80s90s very well stated comment cr is terrific but you have to understand their standards and methods their reliability data is based on if i remeber correctly about 800000 replies and that should bury some nuts that answer based on emotions rather than real experience their ratings are based primarily on how normal people drive cars  not on how a few drivers push them to their limits but if you read the material they provide you can get info on how cars perform at their limits i think the bmw 330i is a better car pushed to its limits than the acura tl but the acura tl is a better car for the normal driver i own a tl and an 325xit and have driven a 330i scca point standings as has been pointed out on this topic before reflect the cars being modified and weighted down to make them competitive httpwwwworldchallengecomseriesfactshtml  look at vehicles  look down to spot 14 theres a subaru wrx if you think the wrx cant beat both a tsx and a 325i around the track in a true test of speed you need to drive one the wrx can keep up with vette on the right track dave thats kind of the point of the original poster though once you take out the power and weight advantages of any one car it now comes down to driver and again the reason it was brought up the other engineering aspects of the car namely drive wheels final point on fwdrwd\\nthere are 2 points\\n1\\na car does not perform better because it is rwd 2\\nnot many people believe fwd outperform rwd and\\neven less people can actually explain or experience the skills\\nand techniques required to drive fast and win a race vs rwd or whatever\\nfwd can outperform rwd regularly which to many is a myth i believe the reason is\\nthere arent many people who race fwd cars vs rwd  in these forums\\nand i think there are even less people who race professionally and win in these forums to be able to explain how and why\\nit takes experienceskills in both rwd and fwd to be able to explain the difference how and why thats kind of the point of the original poster though  no he said that fwd and rwd dont matter for performance which is incorrect and he used a series in which fwd was competitive to prove it that proves nothing since the cars have been modified to be competitive irrespective of their natural advantages and disadvantages its like me claiming that im as good as a golfer as tiger woods because i might beat him when you factor our handicaps in dave reminds me of harrison bergeron  handicap the overachievers and then theyre equal to the underachievers first of all if you are going to compare them i would throw the c out and throw in the srt8 than all or your concerns with composure and cornering as well and you still at the same price harrison bergeron meant a lot to me when i was in a normal grade school the srt8 isnt entry luxury though and i think if you chucked a car off the list due to handling a c230 sport wouldnt be the first to go dave i dont think we are seeing this the same way any good scientific experiment tries to eliminate all other variables aside from what you are trying to compare i may be wrong but im guessing the cars were modified to have basically similar powerweight ratios no if you were able to tell me that they had to give the fwd more power and less weight than the rwd car well then youd have an argument but if they weigh the same have the same power output same transmissions same suspension etc etc and the only difference between the cars is how it puts the power to the ground then that is the only thing left that could make a difference between them on the track maybe im wrong maybe it really is a 300 hp 2800 lb tsx vs a 250 hp 3200 lb 325 in which case no its not a good or fair comparison to use at all thanks qbrozen\\nyou know it seems post 3784 was argueing the definition of fwd\\nthe power is still being put the ground with front tires fwd or read tires rwd\\nor it was debating the class rules\\ncome oneven with evidence facts results there seems to be excuses\\nnow what if this was reversed\\nsay i posted rwd better then fwd\\nthink i could justifybut the rules were evened out towards rwd\\nthe purpose of racing organizations is to balance the competition that does not mean convert fwd to rwd and rwd to garbage you must think you fully understand and are basically saying the scca is unfair\\nbecause it is impossible for a fwd to drive faster then a rwd\\nand if fwd did win so what the rules were unfair haha\\nill sum it up it is impossible for fwd to beat rwd\\nand if it did somehow it is because rules are different and rwd were so unfairly comprimised see how these replies are sooo clouded so blinded by rebutle the point is you cannot explain how to drive a fwd fast so the rules must have been unfair or the car basically wasnt a fwd car anymore the rules transformed the fwd car into awd and made the rwd into a bicycle 1wd talking to walls with no holesi need some teamates qbrozens post explained this much better does any one know  roughly the price of the insurance on a a tl  mi in california\\nlate twentys 1 speeding ticket dui 1\\ncan you help 1 i thought you were done talking about fwd vs rwd a few posts back p let me observe for everyones benefit that this particular debate sometimes including awd of course almost always arises in any comparo that includes differently powered vehicles and every time it does no proponent of one type or another ever convinces anyone to change an opinion its been an interesting examination of the issues but its time to move on lets agree to disagree on this particular facet of the differences in these vehicles and find some other issue to beat to death shades it really is time to move on  good luck jesse if ca rates are anything like ma with one speeding ticket and a dui mr obvious says dont ever drive ui again and i dont mean dont get caught do not drive you will more than likely injure or kill someone like my son daughter wife or me you will not be happy with insurance premiums regardless of the make of car try online quotes or ask your present insurer for a quote and yes unfortunately i knew a beautiful young woman who drove drunk and killed a family of four in a headon after crossing over to the wrong side of the road as often seems the case she was physically ok but psychologically and legally her life too changed for the very much worse at a young age a better place to pursue this is in our what do you pay for insurance discussion check it out  obviously you have never owned a 77 breakdown i mean mustang always broke down at exactly the wrong time in middle of the arizona in 115 degree heat on big date etc i swear by the time i got rid of the car i replaced the entire engine piece by piece i think i repleyed to the wrong person blueguy blush i was confused by your post to meno big deal cr is a good source but it has to be taken a grain of salt while they dont have an agenda per se their reviews tend to be on the conservative side people are volunteering to respond which is key random sampling will reveal the best results i had a phsycology professor comment on all the behavior studies we were looking at and how they were to apply to the general population he said in reality a lot of these studies were done with starving college students who volunteered to be in the study the people that respond to cr surveys are subscribers to the report  i would guess them to be a pretty reliable lot  they are not starving college students call your current ins co and ask them theyll tell you for free  probably just need to look it up in a book what kind of tires need to be changed every year what kind of mileage before they need to be changed what maintenance is done within the 450k period mostly oil changes right any tuneups any break jobs doesnt matter what kinda tires i put on any car i own i rarely break 15k miles with a set went the potenza had res first then got sa03s  which were horrible route on the first two sets and they were gone within 15k miles each time going with kumho on this setdoubt theyll last either all maintenance is covered on bmwsbrakes windshield wipers you name it the only thing a bimmer owner must pay for is new tires so far my car has had ebrake failure my disa valve is broken getting replaced soon and my ignition coils went out all covered under warranty but the scheduled maintenance within the 4yr50k period is mostly going to consist of oil changes right bmws dont require tuneups until 100k miles how long will brakes last before the pads are replaced thats probably pretty pricey i dont think youd have any old shop work on your bmw brakes i just had my inspection i that occurs at 30k miles at that time they also replaced the front brakes the oil change alone runs 94 if you had to pay for it 7 qts of synthetic but there is another 15 hours of labor on top of that for all of the checks and they really do them they found the brakes needed replacing plus a window regulator that was ready to go bad this one service plus the brake job would have been around 900 no charge to me add in two more oil servicesat 15k and 45k miles plus anything else your car might need it is not a minor matter bmws are expensive to service at a dealer the included service is a big factor in the cost of operating the vehicle regards\\nkyfdx bmws dont require tuneups until 100k miles no idea i leased the cardont care about its longevity how long will brakes last before the pads are replaced thats probably pretty pricey i dont think youd have any old shop work on your bmw brakes many bimmer fanatics are into a few non oem brands for brakes id let my normal mechanic do it if the car were outside warranty 147what kind of tires need to be changed every year148 the tire wear that blueguy talks about is due in large part to the aggressive wheel alignment of the bmw sport setups tires last much longer without the sport suspensions for instance a colleague of mine just replaced the tires on his nonsport 530 after a whopping 75k miles performance tires will also wear quicker the higher the speed rating the quicker it will wear aggressive driving will also cut into tire life bigtime plenty of porsche owners typically change tires between 8k12k miles and it is due to all of the above they don146t even race their cars not on a track anyway 147doesnt matter what kinda tires i put on any car i own i rarely break 15k miles with a set148 blueguy\\x85 curious which other cars have you owned it isnt the cars it is the driver p yep i would think that has a lot to do with it however i still think the tire wear would differ considerably depending on cars and tires no doubt but his selfdescribed driving style would trash any set of tires in a year you are right about the setup on a 3series it just eats rear tires but i wouldnt change a thing here is crs report on the tls driving experience by professional drivers the tls firm ride is wellcontrolled with good isolation from bumps the highway ride is steady and the cabin is very quiet the wide turning circle is one of the few negatives the acura feels taut and responsive in cornering with wellcontained body lean the nicely weighted steering is communicative and quick in emergencyhandling tests the tl demonstrated good tire grip and cornering balance and it proved secure in our avoidance maneuver where it posted a quick 525mph powered by a smooth 270hp 32liter v6 the tl is noticeably quicker than many of its competitors even with such high horsepower the car was largely devoid of torque steer a tendency for the front wheels to briefly pull the vehicle off its intended line under strong acceleration common in frontwheeldrive cars the engine is coupled with a smooth and responsive fivespeed automatic transmission the tl gets a respectable 23 mpg overall and meets ultra low emissions vehicle standards which means that it is 50 percent cleaner than the average 2004 model braking was very good p blueguy\\x85 curious which other cars have you owned last 3 cars 01 jetta 18t 13k average for tires 03 protege es i got about 16k out of my first set 03 330i well i guess it depends on where you set your standard which is one reason i do my own research ie test drives and dont depend on magazines biased or unbiased for information how often do you go through brakes anyway i think i have a good idea how you drive i would also guess that you dont eat quiche  how often do you go through brakes anyway i think i have a good idea how you drive i would also guess that you dont eat quiche my brakes last a long time just sold my protege and they said i had 60 of my pads left and the car had 26k miles on it my bimmers brakes are still original too and ive got almost 30k miles on it just tiresi go through them faster than robert downey jr can finish off a kilo of coke and i do eat quiche my two year old niece loves that stuff  any good scientific experiment tries to eliminate all other variables aside from what you are trying to compare i may be wrong but im guessing the cars were modified to have basically similar powerweight ratios no no i explained otherwise and so did the article i posted links to  wears out the brakes i wear out the tires she goes around corners at 10 mph i go around them at whatever speed i happen to be driving when i get to them her description look ma no brakes well i guess it depends on where you set your standard thats exactly right ive often mentioned car handling can be just as subjective as judging a cars exterior ive never driven a tl but it makes sense it was a cr top pick it has great reliability a nearly unbeatable standard features package 270 hp engine but ultimately it depends where a driver sets hisher standard when it comes to picking a car handling is quite subjective the magazines praise the cts yet i feel its floaty and dips wildly in corners to each his own this one service plus the brake job would have been around 900 900 sounds like you got into an accident\\nthats a ridiculus price even if it is covered under warranty\\ntheres no justification for that my subjective opinion is that the tl handles great i can take turns and on and offramps at a pretty quick speed wihtout feeling body roll or that the tires might lose grip im not a speedster but i love testing the handling in my tl well they dont have to justify it labor rates are 96hr it isnt any different at lexus infiniti mercedes etc well a little different at those dealers they present you with a bill when you pick up the car at my dealer i give the keys to the loaner they hand me a printout and say have a great day 900 brake change and regular service\\n96hr so it costs 900 to change brakeservice with lexus infiniti mercedes\\nsee wrong point\\nyou might as well walk into the dealer with sign i like to be ripped off please charge me 900 for brake change haha\\n still under warranty does not justify the  cost\\nand please eat my tires as a suspension design flaw\\nits good you owners like to accept these servicemaintenance charges\\nbut its a ___ so its very worth it haha 900 brake changeservice im happy owners are paying that good for the owners yeah i gotta learn that one day handling is quite subjective the magazines praise the cts yet i feel its floaty and dips wildly in corners to each his own thats exactly my point i drove the cts as well and have a contrasting opinion  i thought the handlingsteering was quite taut and predictable very 3 series like in handling i thought 900 for a brake is kind of high by itself what is included in the service besides brake job is it just visual inspection of thing or it is actual change of spark plugs wires etc not sure what was included but i think itd be interesting to know how service and maintenance works thedrak the tl handles just fine just how fast do you want to take turns maniac p sounds like you should only lease bmws and probably all the other german makes not own them and that 900 bill is probably not as high as repairs and maintenance jobs go what do they mean by entreylevel  the low end of a luxury manufacturers offerings eg infiniti g series but not the m series bmw 3 series but not the 5 or 7 series audi a3 or a4 but not a6 or a8 etc yeah i know but i think these lower end cars are often superior to the higher end cars for example the rl is not 15000 better than the tl in fact i think the tl is superior in fit and finish looks etc the bmw 3 series is better than the 5 and 7 and the infiinity g35 coupe is the best car they offer p think it all you want these cars are the introductory models for the lineup the 3 series is basically the toyota echo of the bmw line up i think the term entrylevel is a demeaning at best i bought a tl because i like the car not that i couldnt afford an rl from the side the rl looks exactly like an accord i am considering buying an infinity and the g35 coupe is the only infinity i am considering i think the m is big fat cluncker the entrylevel cars tend to be much more sporty toyota echo  all he is saying is that the 3series is the bottom of the bmw line just as the echo is the bottom of the toyota line entrylevel may be a demeaning term to you but its a fairly widespread term used to describe a level that is a cut above average and perhaps a cut below the highest level at least in this case in terms of cost i dont believe that most folks see it as a demeaning term you chose the tl and you are very happy with your choice even though as you say you could have purchased something more expensive the reality is that the the tl competes with vehicles in a class that is a cut below the more expensive offerings of the same manufacturers that is not an insult its just a reality shades who am i to argue with a host however just because a car is cheaper does not make it inferior in fact the tl is probably superior in most respects to any american car regardless of price i have test driven the rl and thought the luxury of the tl was its equal and roominess was the same p the point i was trying to make and evidently did not is just what you said  because a car is cheaper does not make it inferior and there is nothing about the term entrylevel that implies inferior in my estimation but the reality is that there is a more expensive class of vehicles that fact does not mean this class is inferior okay  if the 3 series is the toyota echo of bmw then what does that make the mini the mini is to bmw what saab is to gm while the mini has won many awards and people who drive the car like it it is not a bmw by heritage just like a saab is not a gm by heritage my god this is turning into an sat exam dog is to cat as its definitely a bleachers  popcorn series of exchanges i learn a lot from some of the boards  others are mostly for entertainment entry level is really a term made up by marketers who really would like to see you move up to their next higher and higher read more expensive models the next time you buy it really does not cost all that much more to manufacture say a 5series over a 3series but since the price tag on the 5series can be a lot higher there is a lot more profit in it for the company thats also why the car companies are in love with selling 50k suvs  thats where most of their profits come from but keep in mind that for many of us one persons entry level car is another persons ideal car i am quite happy with my 325i and am also still living in the starter home that we bought 23 years ago entry level as a marketing ploy yeah never thought of it that way before but you are correct i am sure however i can afford a much more expensive car but as soon as i saw and test drove the tl i was hooked entry level is a market segment if manufacturers didnt make entry level sedans there would be two choices spartan or luxury youd be able to get a car for 10000 or 50000 but not for any price inbetween so where does the 1 series fit in  entry level or near luxury i think i prefer entry level i do understand what youre saying frisco that these socalled entry level cars seem to be better than their more expensive siblings i think that may be due to the fact its hard to overlook the value these 30k cars offer vs the 50k with slightly more hp and more standard features if i had an extra 20k or so to waste  id probably trade up to the m45 i got the extra cash to spend but i still believe the tl is a much better value than the rl and my wife chose the cheaper but suprior can imho p the rl is a superior car given form vs function and leaving price out of the equation however only you can decide if the extra featuresfunctions are worth the price sort of like saying the new e90 is a better car than the new and upcoming m5 because its cheaper and more tossable so where does the 1 series fit in  it doesnt in the usa bmw is worried there is no market for it and it will tarnish the image if it comes herei think itll be viewed the same as the tsx  some kind of tweener or bridge to luxury the a4 was audis base until the a3 how can you leave price out of the equation form and function the tl styling is superior imo i have driven both cars and the tl interior is as good as the rl in roominess and fit and finish sort of like saying the new e90 is a better car than the new and upcoming m5 because its cheaper and more tossable lol p the rl interior is a step above the tl not a very high step but its a step or two in fact i think the tl is superior in fit and finish looks etc the bmw 3 series is better than the 5 and 7 and the infiinity g35 coupe is the best car they offer \\nwhoa frisco you are truly a tl fanatic you must have some sort of planmanifesto when it comes to infiltrating the forums with your tl propagandha anyway i think it would be safe to say that most if not all in this forum would pick a 5 series m45 e class rl over their entry level counterparts given price was not an issue the awd rl ranked second in a 55k sport sedan comparo beating out the 535i e320 gs430 etc\\nthe tl is a great car without a doubt but does look strikingly similar to tsx and even a bit like an accord if youve ever been in the interior of an accord ex w leather youd probably do a double take thinking you were in a tl id pick the luxuryperformanceexclusivity of an rl over a tl anyday re entry level and whatever you call the step up i think only bmw maybe audi too does it right the 2nd level 5series rl m car is fastersometimes bigger and more luxurious yet for some reason only the bmws can be had with a manual tranny thats probably the only reason all things being equal ill take my tl over an m otherwise the m sounds fantastic lol but i can afford just about any car on the planet i want and i prefer the tl from acura over the rl test drove both btw it looks likes like a tsx from the from front  and nothing like an accord btw look at the rl from the side and it looks remarkably like an accord the interior fit and finish of the tl is just as good as the rl and the rl is really not much roomier i guess i just like the sportier lower end cars than the bigger brothers p theres this thing called protesting too much im sure given your degree of refinement you know the reference you may want to take all those resources you could have spent and   and i prefer the tl from acura over the rl and i prefer the tsx over both go figure this is exactly what i mean we all have are own preferences you prefer the tsx a small sporty car which is great i prefer the tl over the rl a smaller sportier car this is great if i wanted a big lux car i would by the top of the line mb not an rl p okay the results are in for the august automobile mag comparo 0 to 60 and price in parantheses 1 330i 6mt 61s 42k the best drivers car and the best interior no idrive was a plus\\n2 g35 6mt 58s 34k the best car if value considered the best car by the numbers\\n3 cts 36 6mt 65s forgot price the americans are catching up real fast  btw rt had separate tests of the 330i 6mt and the a4 20t 6mt the praised both effusively their numbers were 330i 6mt 62s\\na4 20t 6mt 64s wow everybody is getting such lousy 060 times on the e90 hmmmsomething is off with that car everybody used to say that bmw underrated their engines maybe they are just using a more realistic rating system to be in line with their competitors looking at power to weight the new 330 is just about where it should be in acceleration everybody used to say that bmw underrated their engines i wonder about that because my e36 is rated at 189 hp but friends who have pretty fast cars dont believe it i drove the e90 330 and it feels fast but it doesnt feel to me as if it has 65 more hp dave i drove the e90 330 and it feels fast but it doesnt feel to me as if it has 65 more hp if youve read the car mag hop up articles over the years you know it takes a significant hp jump to produce noticeable acceleration improvements thats why im always amused when someone claims they can feel the difference when they install a kn air filter no way one can feel a 510hp increase in a 200 hp engine yes ive read such articles yet i still think id have a greater perception of more than 25 hp increase of course theres a lot of factors torquerpm weight gearing etc dave bmws published number is also 61 seconds a3 has slower published times but it felt plenty fast faster than needed for most types of city driving around here with all the radar around including photo radar each car mag have different numbers c and d have very fast numbers most under 6 i wonder if they changed the gearing from the e45 to the e90 the e45 was a bit short compared to its competitors does anyone know the e45 060 how short is the g35 gearing it seemed a bit high when i drove it entrylevel segment of cars cost around 30k usd it is describing the cars not the drivers if you have so much problem about it need to ask yourself why walton the wmart founder drove an old pickup he didnt need to put affordability into words he didnt worry about it btw objectively an average one can afford a car means the cost of the car is about x of his overall asset that x can vary by person can be 000001 for walton but better dont be over 30 car doesnt make a person to make it short oh i agree 100 with you as it was pointed out to me it is merely a marketing ploy and i agree with that point too unfortunately walmart employees cant even afford an old pickup mad how short is the g35 gearing it seemed a bit high when i drove it if you mean gear ratios i think the g35 gearing is pretty short driving on the freeway at 80 mph my usual highway cruise speed in sixth gear you get 25  3 k rpms i can even drive at 40 mph in sixth gear on a relatively flat road without having the engine complain i kind of wished 6th gear was taller so i could get better gas mileage cruising on the freeway oh well of course this shorter gearing is better for performance because you can use more gears when accelerating also a shorter sixth gear means you dont have to shift down if you want to pass some one on the freeeway so i think this is a better choice after all but the g is definately not one of those german cars with a super tall sixth gear made for cruising at 100 mph also a shorter sixth gear means you dont have to shift down if you want to pass some one on the freeeway so i think this is a better choice after all but thats precisely why i buy a manual i want to shift vw and mazda think along those you need passing power in top gear lines too and it makes me crazy mad because then i get lousy mileage on road trips in their cars give me a really really tall 6th if at 80 i still need more power to pass ill fall back to 4th and take off i still get over 30 mpg running 8590 all day in my bmw but i still wish the cars 6th gear was even taller i bought a manual to control the card you have a point it almost seems that the japanese engineers assumed that americans follow speed limits when deciding on the g35 gearing big mistake so if you want max fuel efficiency on the highway you will probably have to drive the speed limit around 65 mph but as i said above there is a bright side  more shifting fun at lower speeds for some reason better top gear acceleration i suppose infinitis are geared lower than pretty much all the competition look at any rpm at 60 mph figures in the car mags the the g35 and m35 are spinning about 500 rpm higher than the competition i think this is what kills the highway mileage compared to say a tl for some reason better top gear acceleration i suppose infinitis are geared lower than pretty much all the competition im sure their engineers decided more oomph when you mash the pedal down would sell more cars than an extra 23 mpg personally 30mpg highway  20 city will make me move on but i know im not like most americans the mpg was one of the several reasons i chose the tl over the g35x to have to pay for premium gas and get relatively poor mpg was just too much for my frugal new england psyche to take a1 service on wednesday ive asked dealer to investigate the intermittent disappearing temperaturememory settings and a rattle when the sunroof is in the vent position thats it so far personally 30mpg highway  20 city will make me move on but i know im not like most americans  then you should probably go for the audi a4 2l turbo its mileage is pretty damn good for a 200hp car i almost got it but in the end could not resist the performance of the g35 note i also posted this on the help me choose board but i wanted to post it here because i am looking for a performance sedan also i live in chicago and when it comes to rwd vs awd i dont know which one is better for the gs430 and just fyi i have a longer term goal set on the 07 gs but thats when i have a larger income \\ngreetings im a former owner of a 00 es300 and 02 es300 i absolutely loved the prestige of driving a lexus the color combo of the 00 was graphiteblack and the 02 was goldcream i definitely prefer the black interior and i have quite honestly been spoiled with the luxury convenience features like heated seats passenger control climate moonroof speed controlled volume etc the 02 had a nav system rain sensor wipers and more bells and whistles than i could imagine but the radical change in body style reminded me too much of a camry and i would prefer s distinct style in my vehicle i actually walked up to a camry on several occasions thinking it was mine so now im looking at the 02 or 03 gs430 i like the luxury sport sedan combo the 04 g35 and the 04 or 05 acura tl im hearing great things about the nav system in the tl which is not a need but a definite desire some of the things that i have not experienced but would like to have are\\nbluetooth capability i didnt have a bluetooth capable phone when i had the 02\\nsteering wheel controls for radiocd\\ndvdcd player\\nvoice commands for nav\\ntraffic guidance for nav\\ni hear these last 2 items are features of the tls nav system oh and my price range is low 30s yes i know i want the world but whats a single female with no children to do these days besides splurge on herself before shes unable to do so im not sure i want to give up driving a lex but i just might have to any thoughts  then you should probably go for the audi a4 2l turbo its mileage is pretty damn good for a 200hp car i would also say that the a4 doesnt feel like a 200 hp car at least not to me it feels darn strong fortunately there are several choices for good mileage and good power a4 tl 330 s40t5 93 i never really think of prestige when researching cars i just saw the tl on the street and thought to myself that is one very nice looking car test drive a tl and gun it on the freeway plus the tl has lots of lux going for it p greetings im a former owner of a 00 es300 and 02 es300 i absolutely loved the prestige of driving a lexusi actually walked up to a camry on several occasions thinking it was mine \\nhmm so much for prestige if youre mistaking your own car for a camry so now im looking at the 02 or 03 gs430 i like the luxury sport sedan combo the 04 g35 and the 04 or 05 acura tl im hearing great things about the nav system in the tl which is not a need but a definite desire some of the things that i have not experienced but would like to have are acura hands down has the best navi system it makes the equivalent items in infinitibmwlexus look like tinker toys bluetooth capability i didnt have a bluetooth capable phone when i had the 02\\nsteering wheel controls for radiocd common in acura steering wheel controls are in the g but no bluetooth dvdcd player to watch if thats what you mean itll be aftermarket voice commands for nav\\nacura traffic guidance for nav\\n0506 acura rl is the only one i know of with this feature oh and my price range is low 30s acura tl done go find one drive it and if you like it buy it acura tsx offers most of the same features for much less  under 30k better car imho too if she has been driving a lex a tsx might be too much of a harsh ride and so would a bmw tl has a smoother ride and and tons of power i wouldnt say a tsx is a better car just different however for a sporty ride the tsx is a fantastic value its like getting a bmw for 10k less at least ts like getting a bmw for 10k less at least the tsx is a good car but its nothing like a bmw better tranny better workmanship than a 3 by a long shot but also less powerful rides too high has a 4 cylinder and its got power going to the wrong wheels if i had to spend 26k on a car the tsx is a strong contender if ive got 35k the 330i wins without a fight better interior more features stronger power luxurious ride incredible stereo equal reliability plenty of room if i was cruising on a crosscountry drive thats the car to drive at the 30k price point if you are a high performance driver there are better choices but the tl is the one my wife would want as you are both steeped in luxury and driving a goodlooking machine i personally like the silver with the black leather interior for this car if she has been driving a lex a tsx might be too much of a harsh ride and so would a bmw tl has a smoother ride and and tons of power hm if you mean the 330i with the sport package then maybe it has 18 inch rims otherwise i dont think the 3 is harsher than the tl my wife chose the silver with black interior p but lets be honest here the car otd is going to be at least 35k for a navi i love my wifes tl she cant get me out of it she mentioned 04sprivate party on an 04 with navi and 20000 miles is 28k good point but 20000 miles on a one year old car is a lot it did seem that she was willing to buy used luxsports cars i was just thinking that if she drove a tl i think she would be impressed an 04 tl is nearly two model years old 06s are two months awayso 2430k miles is normal ill have to weigh in on the side of the tl  heres some general comments no particular order and i include a little scoring system 1 for 1st 0 for 2nd 1 for 3rd thats really just for my own fun 1 ride quality as far as ride quality id guess you prefer a cushier luxurious ride to a sporty tight ride the used gs430 your considering would probably have the best ride but with all the hightech features you want the tl would probably be a good compromise between comfort price and features the g35 has the most sporty probably least forgiving ride of the 3 gs 1 tl 0 g35 1 2 status i think acura has the least status among lexus infiniti and acura i think lexus is 1 of those 3 so the gs has it here too gs 2 tl 1 g35 1 3 features the used gs isnt going to be the most technologically advanced of the 3 cars you might be considering the tl has it hands down with all the features you mentioned except for traffic navigation only in the rl  maybe the infiniti m and a video player youll also have to say goodbye to rainsensing wipers something i sorely miss from my last car the voicerecognition of the tls nav and its integration with climate control and the radio is utterly amazing i cannot understate this you can be driving and just verbally tell the car to change the temp pass temp only direct air through particular vents etc you can scroll through your presets and when theres nothing on the radio direct the cd player to play any particular track on any particular disc  its awesome as an aside the infiniti m which is out of your price range and might be too rough a ride has the best technological features of any car i know if it came with a manual transmission itd be my dream car another bonus to the tls nav is that its a touchscreen which makes entering info manually much easier than otherwise and you can enter info while in motion my parents lexus does not allow this i dont know about the g35s nav but in general i think the g35 is the least technically advanced of the 3 but a new g would have it over an onlder lexus i think gs 1 tl 0 g35 1 price im not checking the classifieds for you but i know that to get all the tech features you want itll add much more to the gs since itll probably need to be aftermarket if it can be done at all and itll cost the least extra on the tl bc its all included except the nav which is pretty common depending on the changes made on the 06 models you might be willing to save even more  by buying a used tl or g35 gs 0 tl 1 g35 1 anyway my scoring has the tl ontop no surprise  its what i drive but disregarding the scoring for a sec you need to discount the bmw  g35 bc they value sportiness over luxury and you seem to prefer luxury the gs has it in luxurious ride and prestige the tl has it in technology i think your choice comes down to those two and will depend on which you value more ps  i think a guy will be more impressed by a tl than a gs as a single gal that might play into things a bit the past two season bill auberlin won the touring car national championship in a bmw 325 this year hes down in cumulative points because hes only raced a few events since he is also racing in other type events he won the last touring car race at lime rock park a few weeks ago\\ncomparing these highly tuned machines is not an indicator of which is faster each car has weight added or taken out based on how well they did in the previous race if you win two races in a row you get weight added each time they intentionally try to level the field to make it competitive for the fans\\nfront wheel drive or rear wheel drive is a personal preferance but more people who like to drive spiritedly choose rear wheel drive and a manual transmission the current issue of automobile magazine compares what they call the best sports sedans from three continents they selected the cadillac ctv from the us the bmw 330i from europe and the infiniti g35 from asia they made a point about leaving out a very good acura tl because it was not rear wheel drive and therefore not a true sports sedan ive owned alot of cars over the years including a number of front wheel drive models nothing could touch my two miatas for handling the miata has 6 consecutive national championships in autocross i currently drive a 2005 infiniti g35 6 speed and a 2002 bmw z3 30i 5 speed roadster rear wheel drive has a different feel to it you either like it or you dont excuse my ignorence but is the miata a fwd or rwd hmm its only been out for over 15 years rwd like i said excuse my iignorence plus its a car i would never consider buying thank you so much for everyones responses i really appreciated the advice im obtaining quotes for new vehicles all around 33k and ive seen the following used listings i plan to negotiate the prices 1 05 silvergray 6155 31888\\n2 05 anthraciteblack 4177 33995 i like this combo the best but not the price was there a signifant change between 04 and 05 i tried looking on the acura website for this info but wasnt successful in finding it thanks again everyone no there wasnt if yu look up the 05 tl review at edmundscom itll tell you what changed those are not very good pricingas that is what i would expect from a brand new and not used car btwyou did ask a question on the help me choose forum you might want to check that one out if you have not yetas a number of us have responded based upon your requirementsthe 2005 tl is my recommendation and which i own why i would recommend if you enjoy the luxury of a lexus then the tl has the mix for you the interior is definitely superior to the g35and will remind you of the lexus gs series it even rivals my 2004 bmw 7 series featuresit has all the items you have indicated bluetoothcontrols etc if you order them through the g35you are looking to add 7k above the tl through a package stereo6 cd indash changerwith 8 speakers with universally accepted superior performance controlled with buttons on the steering wheel dual climate zones power seats all the features you indicated are included in the model without any premium packages to buy performancewell it has 270 hp and the latest car and driver magazine shows that it can easily keep up with the bmw 3 series past reviews from others show a very competitive performance to others in its class as for pricingyou can get a nonnavigation tl for about 305knav for about 32k g3537k with horrible 16mpg in mixed driving get a similarily equiped bmw 3 seriespay 48k lexus gspay 50k if you really want something differentlook at the tl in dark green exterior with the parchment or camel interiorwhich will have wood trims included at no cost that is sharp and similar to the lexus interior so yesyou can have the world and you will never pine to drive your lex again duly noted and tahnks again for the heads up on the pricing where on earth do you get 37k for a g35 invoice on a g35 without navigation to be applestoapples with your tl price is 29k add the premium package and youre up to 32k invoice on a stripped tl is 302k your pricing information is pretty biased and not true at all and with incentives right now on the 05s a g35 is a good 2k lower than sticker without negotiating allow me to support the 37k pricing for a g35as i have been challenged by another to substantiate a base g35 6mt coupe is 33350 add in the premium package 2450 navigation 2000 xm radio 400 a must if you are going to compare to the tl splash guards 210 plus destination 610 total msrp  39020 quotes i received a month ago were at 37k perhaps i could have negotiated pricing further downbut i determined the tl was for me to substantiate my claimsgo to the g35 prices paid and buying experiences review recent posts 2625 and 2627 pricing of 37030 and 37700 respectively where you got 29k for a nonnavigation g35 i do not knowas the base msrp is already 33k without any premium package a stripped down version with nothingno sunroofnothingwhen the original poster was one that required amenities and in order to compare to the tl am i biased and not true i hope to be correct in my assessment let me know if i am incorrect in my pricing calculations and whether the pricing posted above are incorrect re the 29k for nonnavi heres a quote from a dealers email that i received today invoice on a tl with navi is 32555 and tl without navi is 30734 i could save you a little more money but cannot do an invoice deal the fact that the 2006s will be out in a couple of months doesnt really help usbecause most dealers in the area including ourselves will be out of 2005s before they start coming in and just fyi another dealer that did not have my color combo said this\\nno but the market is soft so you should be able to get the car and a\\nlow price just about anywhere though he did not quantify low price tl with 6speed nav and summer tires 35500 its not honest to compare shopped price to sticker price carsdirect says 34970 in my area for a tl with nav g35 with navpremiumxenon 35660 the pricing i provided is paid price to paid price not shopped price to sticker price as you suggested as i indicatedgo look at the prices paid at both boards and you will see i even provided specific post numbers for the gs showing prices paid by others at 37k  as for the tl pricing which includes destination costsyou just have to head over to the tl prices paid board to validate even if you dont head overlook at the quote the original poster laydi just received i believe an initial 322k for nav and 307 for nonnav and posted in a message 3903 above yours is apples and oranges as carsdirect is not what is the going rate and not certain if it even includes destination chargesas once againlook at what people have been paying on the boards here i am not making it upjust look at the prices paid on the boards reread my message 3902 and you will see i would still recomend the tl for laydi because it seems that she prefers features rather than performance the tl is fine performing machine and is actually faster than the g35 sedan so if laydi wants features lux and performance the tl is the car still think i am misleading my apologiesbut let me mention a few items to clearify that my intent was not to mislead firstmost likely than notwhen people think of g35they think of the coupe and the sedan is a secondary thought thereforei priced the coupe i hope i supported my pricing of 37000 for the g35 coupe 6mt in my previous note i think all will agree to the prices paid as demonstrated on the board postings on this web site the 37k is fact as for the price of the g35 sedani did not specifically get a pricing however i understand that it is roughly about 355k i believe compared to the tl wnav of 322k which was demonstrated by laydi email quote from the dealer second paragraph yesi did not bargain further on the g35 as i disclosed in my initial note howeveronce againthe pricing i provided is pricing paid by others on the boardafter negotiations please refer to the messages on the board which i referred tothose are actual paid prices 37k for a g35 6mt coupe i did not make them up 37kfact once again so let me summarize most think of the g35 as a coupe the g35 6mt coupe with nav is selling for 37k according to multiple postings on this web sites board the g35 sedan is approximately 355k these prices compares to acura tl which is being initially quoted to a prospective buyer at 325kwith a likely purchase price of 32k after negotiations all in allforget the discussion of the pricing look towards my initial email today which goes over the various amentities of the tland how it addresses laydi initial email which communicates her wants and desires in a carshe wants the world the tl should be considered yours is apples and oranges as carsdirect is not what is the going rate and not certain if it even includes destination chargesas once againlook at what people have been paying on the boards here youre rightany person with decent negotiating skills should be buying lower than carsdirectcoms price i am not making it upjust look at the prices paid on the boards reread my message 3902 and you will see those people arent very good at what theyre doing the g35 6mt with navi xm premium and splash guards what blazes is that is listed for 33k on carsdirectcom id expect any infinit dealer would beat that by 200500 theres a 2000 manufacturer to dealer incentive on the g35 that means get the price to 200 over invoice what one should pay for a car this old and then subtract another 2k from the price thats the target of course 200500 is more realistic and if you cant get a dealer to let you in on the 2k that dealer isnt worth going to firstmost likely than notwhen people think of g35they think of the coupe first youre on a sedan board so when comparing the tl to the g35 were talking sedan to sedan second the sedan outsells the coupe by over 1 thousand units a month the sedan is what most g35 buyers think ofas its what most of them buy my visual survey of the road and dealership indicates g35 coupes is most common perhaps it is only in so calif and from the appearance of the g35 edmunds board discussionsit also appears to be coupes are more popular either waythe outcome is the same please point me to a posting on the board to support your position i am sure they will boast of their success once againwe are talking about the price of a g35 6mt coupe with all indicated and destination i could be incorrectbut would like to see a posting of a materially different price my visual survey of the road and dealership indicates g35 coupes is most common perhaps it is only in so calif and from the appearance of the g35 edmunds board discussionsit also appears to be coupes are more popular either waythe outcome is the same oh well youve empriically deduced what nationally released sales numbers refute okayfacts schmacts you see more coupes so therefore the g35 coupe is more popular wow for the kids in the back rowthis is a sedan boardnot sure why youre going on and on about the pricing of a coupe on a luxury sedan comparison board i went on and on because others such as yourself popped up with a challenge you are righttruce on the pricing concept tl is still the recommendation firstmost likely than notwhen people think of g35they think of the coupe and the sedan is a secondary thought i must admit delmar i assumed you were talking about the sedan thats what i usually think of when i think of the g35 and from laydis post it seemed clear she was looking specifically for sedans youre a knowledgable poster and in my book your past posts have earned you the benefit of the doubt i think that you always think of the g35 coupe bc in your mind and imo the tl is clearly a better overall vehicle than the g35 sedan while someone who can go with a coupe or a sedan would have a tougher time deciding between the tl and the g35 coupe oh well youve empriically deduced what nationally released sales numbers refute okayfacts schmacts you see more coupes so therefore the g35 coupe is more popular i think you should give the guy a break on this we dont all have time to pur over facts and figures were too busy posting in thse forums  i assume what i see on the road in my area applies nationally too we all base things to some extent on personal experience and if delmar mainly sees coupes or even if he just mainly notices coupes its understandable for him to assume theyre more popular well said taxesquire oknow that we are done with the pricing concept and we now have beaten to death the price of the tl 32k gs coupe 37k and gs sedan 355k and i am not going to discuss that any further no more i have to agree imo with the statement made in the post the tl is clearly a better overall vehicle than the g35 sedan but that is up for discussion what topic of comparison of the tl and gs sedan do we wish to discuss the tl is clearly a better overall vehicle than the g35 sedan depends on what your looking for the g35 sedan will mop the floors in performance against the tl if you take these cars to the racetrack you will see the difference you cannot see the difference on the streets or in the cones or on the skidpad why people talk about performance and then say the racetrack does not matter is beyond me if you want features go with the tl other the g35 is a fine choice i read a few reviews and saw no mention of a manual tranny anyone have definitive facts on this from what i understand it seems that the gs is a midlevel luxury sedan made to look on the outside like a sportsedan that would certainly make sense since the is is really lexus entrylevel luxurysport sedan anyone with a gs with nav id also be interested to know if lexustoyota still restricts people from enterring info while in motion the g35 sedan will mop the floors in performance on the racetrack motor trend has the acura at 63 seconds vs g35 coupe 62 for 060mph yeahthe g35 beats the acura marginally on the racetrack with that differential and as you saidyou will not see the difference on the street i didnt buy my tl for the racetrack as that would have been a waste of all the other included amenities if we are talking racetrack performanceheckwere talking about the wrong set of cars g35 coupe 62 for 060mph first ive seen figures in the low 5s for the g35 second as i said the tl is great until you try to swing it around a racetrack that difference is felt on the streets on one hand you cant talk performance on the other hand you cant say what will happen on a racetrack doesnt count because they are street cars that said the tl handles good enough for you but other drivers can push the g353 series to places where the tl will fall apart low 5s for a g35 you have to be kidding like to see the source of the low 5 measurement as i mentioned motor trend indicated the 62 clock time that is the last i will comment on this topic as i mentionedif i wanted something for the racetrack i would have selected a car other than the g35 or tl nice to see healthy bickering that mine is better than yours i say each to his own and lets move on my choice after extensive back to back testing was for the g35x a big decision was the all wheel drive since i live in the hills of nj dont laugh they exist and the ice and snow are real here otherwise it was a difficult decision and every time i see a tl very often here in northern nj i question if i made the right choice i love my car and time will tell expecially next winter when i determine if the awd was worth it btw 8300 troublefree miles and counting ive heard alot about the difference in the sound systems in these cars i have the bose and for my 52 year old ears it sounds fantastic the tls was also great but im not sure it was better bluetooth was not needed yet since i dont own any bluetooth devices and we have an aftermarket garmin nav system so that was not a decision maker either so all that to say its really a personal choice and i hope all are satisfied with their purchase since for many of us its a long term purchase it had better be the right choice because well have to live with it for a while ive driven both cars and concur with the above assessments price for the base sedans is close enough to not be a discriminator the tl is the one id buy for my wife the g35 is the muscle car my younger brother would want me  mid 40s male  imola red 330i  its having your sport sedan cake and eating your luxury cake too costs a little more but to me it was worth it the g base sedan has no amentities and is not comparable need to upgrade with the premium package and sports suspension package for your reading pleasurethe latest road and track uses the tl as a compable to the 2006 bmw 330i which is priced at 48k check out the news stand at your local barnes and noble i am agreeable to the gs as tilted more towards the luxury end i would say it is more comparable to the acura rl of courseyou need to consider the gs 430 and not the gs 300 to get more sport elements the problem is you are pricing the bmw in such a way that would not be optioned by me in that you assume people want all of the gadgets i dont two reasons i wont buy the tl 1 fwd and 2 to many gadgets with no options my well optioned 330i is about 41k everything i need nothing i dont you might want to check out this link httpwwwedmundscominsidelinedodrivescomparosarticleid106052 i didnt price itroad and track magazine priced it waiti promised in a earlier post not to talk pricingi better shut up no more from me btwthe tl has no options because it is all inclusive ahshifting the pricing blame to rt the tl has no options and to many gadgets for me i like to drive the car not fiddle for performance package natural brown leather xenons and cold weather package fold down rear seats heated front seats and headlight washers  the car was only 10k more than a v6 accord and less than 5k more than either the tl or the g35 to me  worth it still the smaller engined 325i outsold the 330i by 6 to 1 so price does make a difference even for the average bmw consumer i really like the tl  a very nice car  goodlooking fast comfortable a beautiful interior and all the high tech done right\\ni also like the g35 particularly with a manual transmission it has v8 like power and good brakes the automatic transmission is the weakest link in the g35 sedan i think the gs300 and 430 are in another class all together and compete against the 5 series bmw and the acura rl the lexus equivalent is the updated is250 and 350 im still waiting to check those two out the old is handled fine but was a bit gaudy for my taste i still think the tl is the one for the lady as it nicely bridges the gap between her soft luxurious es300 and the g35 a little more sport than what she drove before but not the whole hog of the g35 the g base sedan has no amentities and is not comparable need to upgrade with the premium package and sports suspension package ok i really do not like flame wars but since some people may actually use these forums to make a car buying decision i feel like i should disagree with this statement the g base actually has a lot of features power leather heated seats six cd in dash changer with mp3 adjutsable wheel with telescoping adjustable rear seats power window and mirrors side and curtain airbags xenon lights etc not as much features as the accord of course but enough that you are not really missing anything and as such it is 2k cheaper than the base acord if you insist that the premium package is necessary for comparison then the g35 is about 15 k more expensive and no the g35 does not need the performance package to compare with a base accord the g35 multilink suspension is more advanced than the acura double wishbone one also the g35 uses aluminum in its suspension elements i am not sure if the acura does they dont mention it which probably means they use steel in any event the g35 will handle better even if you do not consider the acuras fwd and the problems with the fwd have already been beaten to death in these forums so in conclusion a standard suspension g35 will handle better than the standard tl suspension on top of everything else if you get the manual tranny you get the performance package standard as well so then you have to add the 18 inch wheels to the tl in order to make it comparable so the g35 with the premium package will be about the same price as a comparable tl with the 18 inch wheels i cannot give exact numbers here because the 18 inch wheels on the tl require unspecified dealership installation charges so in summary\\ng35 auto vs tl auto  tl is 15 k cheaper\\ng35 manual vs tl manual  about the same price in these packages the tl has some more features and better interior while the g35 has more powerful engine and better handling there you go i am getting out of this discussion but since people may be making educated buying decisionslet me list a few things included in the premium package  many features which are already included in the tl pricingbut which require additional costs to upgrade from a base g35 sunroof\\npremium audio system with 7 speakers\\ndrivers seat memory with entryexit assist\\nsteering wheel memory\\nelectrochromic autodimming inside mirror\\nhomelink universal transceiver\\netc anddont forget to include the xm satellite radio i am out and done with this discussion both cars are fine test drive bothand make an educated decision i still think the tl is the one for the lady    well put one might add or those who drive like ladies or not it isnt a car for the lady the look isnt that feminine to be honest the front look looks like a sports car it has a very aggresive and sporty look i dont know it just seems odd for a female to like something aggesive and sporty not saying that there arent women who are like that but on the road i see mostly women who drive like camrys or for those who are rich or want to be outstanding beemers benz minis or vw beatles all this is just my opinion the car was only 10k more than a v6 accord and less than 5k more than either the tl or the g35 as it damn well should be an 04 330i is only the size of a civic not even in the same size class of accord or tl or g35 which are all in the size league of the 5 series lets be honet the tl is the best value motor trend has the acura at 63 seconds vs g35 coupe 62 for 060mph yeahthe g35 beats the acura marginally on the racetrack with that differential and as you saidyou will not see the difference on the street i didnt buy my tl for the racetrack as that would have been a waste of all the other included amenities uh tracking a car has very little to do with 060 tell us how the tl does going into a coming out of a corner no wot out of a corner with a tlyoull end up in a ditch yes to each his own the tl like all acuras save for the nsx has a very feminine look about it nothing wrong with that but the look seems decidely aimed at attracting female drivers like bmws z3 so youre saying then a crown victoria must be the best car for the money since its the biggest for the money it just seems odd for a female to like something aggresive sic and sporty not saying that there arent women who are like that that posting is sexist i am a female and an educated professional in her early 30s who happen to drive a tl i have driven grocery haulers camry to a mercedes slk and i select the tl for many reasons not because i am odd or i am masculine and i do not scare men off with my car as for whether i drive like a lady as another here suggest that the tl drivers areshame on you how narrow minded you must drive alone a lot as a point of reference for the original poster laydithe tl was purchased because the tl is the best value out there it is well balanced between sports and luxury it has all the supple luxury you would expect from a lexus as you have driven it has leading edge technology such as bluetooth it has the amenities that can impress it is a pleasurable car to entertain with the performance is fun and exciting forget all the discussions here of 060 times and the thought that aluminum in the suspension makes for a superior car i doubt many that slam here havent even test driven the tl are the above attributes of why i purchased my car only valued by females i doubt just as not all males measure their cars by 060 times but by other attributes as for a lot of these recent postings these are my thoughts the people in the g35 campthey are sports purists and are slanted more towards the sportsluxury the tl contingency is slanted more towards the luxurysports who is right nobody if you do wish to beat up on each otherthere is the acura tl vs g35 board sample include this\\n306 of 306 re oy vey realty_pro by bodble2 jul 22 2005 805 pm\\nbookmark  reply  email msg\\nreplying to realty_pro jul 22 2005 611 pm actually imo the g35 sedan is the one which is not in the same league as the other 2  even if the other 2 play in 2 different leagues the g is no bmw when it comes to performance and driving feel and it is no match for the tl when it comes to features amenities and quality and it is inferior to both in terms of styling and it would be extremely boring if we all drove the same car modelwouldnt it i dont like milk actually dont like all dairy products for that matter just dont like them at all my friend on the contrary does like milk and dairy products a lot and you know what  we never argue about it he never says milk is good and i never say milk is not good we find that it is not wise to argue about out taste simply because it is a given there are many other topics that are healthy to discus than someones taste and a special note to lalacalif pat please dont delete this posting i think i am not breaking any rules here lalacalif i think you posting is feminist mike so in conclusion a standard suspension g35 will handle better than the standard tl suspension hold on how about some facts road and track a long established and reputable magazine does standardized testing of autos check out road test summary in the back of recent issues data for skidpad and slalom tests are acura tl  087g 658 mph\\ng35  086g 650 mph looks pretty close to me and within the margin of error would have to say that both cars about equal in handling per actual testing well im offended that youve referred to my beloved camry as a grocery hauler that implies that im somehow more of a housewife than the big burly man that i am great now even women are offended by having their rides described as chick cars so youre saying then a crown victoria must be the best car for the money since its the biggest for the money please dont put words in my mouth crown vic is not a sport sedan or luxury sedan so it is quite offtopic a 530i is nowhere nearly as good at handling as a 330i yet it is much more expensive bmw sets the price of the two not me apparently size is a big factor in pricing g35 and tl are much closer to 530i in vehicle utility than 330i acura tl  087g 658 mph\\ng35  086g 650 mph skidpad means nothing it has to do with tires you could get a h2 with big fat tires and it would get a better skidpad number than either of these two vehicle utility your definition of vehicle utility is different than my definition i could go to country buffet and get an all you can eat meal for 10 and walk out stuffed or i could go to the local 5 star star restaurant pay 5 times as much and walk out slightly hungry sure there is more quantity in country buffet but there is more quality in the local 5 star restaurant for me the 330 has all the vehicle utility i need plus its the benchmark and it gets great mileage to boot if you havent noticed there isnt one manufacturer in this topic that doesnt set price by size of their automobiles oh and by the way the 530 is offtopic in this board acura tl  087g 658 mph\\ng35  086g 650 mph looks pretty close to me and within the margin of error would have to say that both cars about equal in handling per actual testing skidpad means zip in terms of real world performance a figure 8 going around cone for the slalom doesnt mean a car will be a hard core performer on a track wot out of a corner with a tl  in a ditch you cant refute that you could get a h2 with big fat tires and it would get a better skidpad number than either of these two has it been tested yet is there any factsnumbers to this nope its only ones feeling the h2 probably will roll over before you get a number blueguy  is there any fact that if tl going hard into a corner will always end up in a ditch at least a statistic numbers or is it just feelings to each his own \\neventhou the car does lower number in 060 but i feel my car is faster\\neventhou the car does lower in skid pad number but i feel the car has better handling\\neventhou the car doesnt have all the featurescomfort that tl has but i feel my car has more features\\neventhou the tl has more of a muscular looking car than the two but i feel bla blla bla it must be really hard for all tls for being the most wantedpopular between the 3 owner that all bimmersg owners are gunning at tl fortunately tl has numbers of facts while these two has much more of a feeling a long time ago people used to think and feel the world was a flat surface\\nif one is a patient of a mental hospital one must feel perfectly sane right acura tl  087g 658 mph\\ng35  086g 650 mph skidpad means nothing it has to do with tires how about slalom tl 658 mph vs g35 650 mph if measured performance in slalom is not good indicator of cars handling ability then what is what else is there that can be measured that one can point to for sake of discussion sometimes car magazines do comparisons of cars handling by testing lap times at a race course but this is not part of r and t road test summary in magazine each month maybe somebody can find a comparison test on a race course from some magazine regarding the cars in question also road and track measures bmw 330 at 654 mph in slalom this is less than tl but within margin of error or significance of difference of 10 mph that road and track states so according to road and track summary data actual measured handling shows g35 330 and tl having very similar capability if you know nothing about cars you can spout a lot of statistics but still know nothing about how a car drives or feels in the 80s a renault alliance gta recorded a higher skidpad number than a corvette tested by cd because of the big fat tire setup so what when it comes to cars feeling is everything in the 80s a renault alliance gta recorded a higher skidpad number than a corvette tested by cd because of the big fat tire setup so what thats a ridiculous reference tl g35 and 330 all in same class of cars and were talking here about measured handling performance in the slalom yes everyone knows fwd feels different than rwd and i would guess that most folks on this board have driven andor owned a lot of both types dont need a lecture here now even though bmw and g35 have rwd and superior 5050 weight distributio the tl with its setup of fwd still has same capability to traverse a course no need to insult anyone now even though bmw and g35 have rwd and superior 5050 weight distributio the tl with its setup of fwd still has same capability to traverse a course okay now tell us why that is fwd vs rwd allseason tires vs summer tires why does the tl post better numbers excuse me but i am really interested in your answer actually is there any fact that if tl going hard into a corner will always end up in a ditch at least a statistic numbers or is it just feelings fwd  wot  torque steer its coming out of the corner where youre going to get smoked if you dont understand this theres nothing more to say to you the tl like all acuras save for the nsx has a very feminine look about it dont see gender there i think that the tl has an italian design flair to it which is positive when current design first came out in late 03 car magazine writers said it reminded them of an italian style car the 3series bmw through the years always looked very good from any angle not so for latest model front end is ok but rest of car looks very generic kind of could pass for a mitsubishi compact car in fact if one covered up grille and badges and did pepsi type test most folks might say it was a mitsu or similar japanese or korean your post is spot on actually my wife has the heavy foot in the family btw i have seen tests where the tl beats the g35 sedan in ever speed test i think that the tl has an italian design flair to it thats probably true it was definately inspired by the alfa romeo sedans which are some of the most beautiful cars on the road but i am not sure if it quite pulls it off i think the acuras thin headlight look leaves way too much flat empty plastic in the front the alfa on the other hand has a more pronounced vshaped grill which cuts through the bumpers so you dont get flat slabs of plastic httpusersskynetbealfaromeoframe2html\\nhttpwwwfastautosnetacuratl13html and httpusersskynetbealfaromeoframe2html\\nhttpwwwfastautosnetacuratl26html i personally like the g coupes styling although it could have done without the corporate look rear end i agree but i think the vshaped grill is the weakest part of the cars looks in some models its just too much in other models its less exagerated and looks nice imho the tl pulls it off the 3series bmw through the years always looked very good from any angle look are subjective and have nothing to do with the way the car drives edmunds for one found it impeccable read the edmunds first looks looks are very subjective but the first time i saw a tl i nearly fell down i thought it was one of the best looking cars i have ever seen same thing happened to me when i saw the g35 coupe looks are very subjective but the first time i saw a tl i nearly fell down i thought it was one of the best looking cars i have ever seen same thing happened to me when i saw the g35 coupe agree think that autoweek had first spy photo of possible 04 tl in summer of 03 in front of san fran hotel when i saw it in autoweek in silver i thought it was stunning and wouldnt it be great if it was production model turns out that it was production if alfa was inspiration think that tl does better interpretation dont care for overdone v shape of alpha g35 coupe is great design g35 sedan very good but not knockout like tl dont necessarily agree that looks are very subjective think that when design is so very good porsche 911 or very bad pontiac aztek that most people can discern these differences it gets harder when the designs are between these extremes there are elements to good design columnist for automobile magazine cumberford is a former auto designer and he critiques car designs in almost every issue check it out just as in building and structure architecture parthenon golden gate etc autos must have proper overall shape details and integration to be pleasing to the eye there are elements to good design columnist for automobile magazine cumberford is a former auto designer and he critiques car designs in almost every issue check it out just as in building and structure architecture parthenon golden gate etc autos must have proper overall shape details and integration to be pleasing to the eye okey dokey confuse totally subjective like art film food etcits all in the eye of the beholder excellent post if alfa was inspiration think that tl does better interpretation dont care for overdone v shape of alpha i agree 100 the tl design takes the best of italian design and the groove of the bmw on the door parallel to the door handles that is just awesome i really think they have pulled off a design miracle btw i am a native san franciscan and still appreciated the golden gate bridge a design brilliancy my god this has turned into a lovefest for an accord with a big engine oh sheesh lol you obviously have not driven an accord or a tl guess should not have referenced parthenon in previous post probably some folks dont know what it is wonder what was inspiration for latest 3 series design know that 5 and 7 series is not entry level in this discussion but it seems rear end on these cars was stolen from early 90s dodge stratus chrysler cirrus and plymouth  compacts there is nothing inherently wrong with the tl the looks are on the okay side and there are a lot of electronic doodads and if you dont drive it very hard it drives just fine i can see why people like it but it is not on the same scale as precision as some of the other vehicles in this category such as cts g35 and 3 series of relevance in this thread 2006 325i 31595\\n2006 330i 37295 this should give toyota a little more breathing room in pricing the 2006 is driven both my friend not impressed by anything but the slickness of the manuals not a big fan of torque steer guess should not have referenced parthenon in previous post probably some folks dont know what it is id assume you were referencing the broken down old building in athens and not the chicago restaurant that supposedly brought the gyros to the us maybe you meant paris pantheon p automobile mag aug 2005 had the above comparo what they found and no one will be surprised was the g35 6mt is the speed demon of bunch yes the g35 will win the stoplight races however the 330 turned in the fastest time at the track doing the laps as the enthusiasts who frequent this board no doubt know it takes more than hp to make the car handle with precision around the turns hey guys confuse im a 26 years old man and i work very hard and now i want to buy a new car i love fast cars  toyota cars 2 so can any of u guys advise me what to buy confuse id assume you were referencing the broken down old building in athens and not the chicago restaurant that supposedly brought the gyros to the us broken down old building  interesting comment and maybe pretty revealing lets get back to merits of styledesign of g35 tl 330 and their performance attributes on design what do long time followers of 3 series design and performance think about latest iteration of 3 does 3 have still have classic style or is it heading toward generic have tl and g35 designsstyles left 3 series in dust 3 series except front looks like korean or japanese compact i guess that you can still have a good performing car such as wrx but dont have to have good styling people will still buy it for performance which is understandable but will close eyes on styling some auto magazine writers also not so excited about new 3 style what do long time followers of 3 series design and performance think about latest iteration of 3 i think that the new 3 style looks more feminine i refer to my 06 325 as she  like my girl the previous body style is sharper more masculine in my eyes old body style of 3 is like arrow  you look at it and it really looks fast fast like and arrow i guess i am just in love with bimmers but everything changes bmw simply could not afford to stay behind and not to change body style while other manufactures do so and in my opinion new style is very good its still bmw itll just take time to get used to it\\ntl is a very nice and sharp looking car it is really a matter of preference who likes what  tl or 3 both are awesome styles before i thought of buying tl but then i said to myself  no ill spent a bit more  but get what i always wanted but still tl is a very sharp and fast looking car really distinctive design not like other cars\\ng35  sorry in my opinion it does not look good at least no comparison to tl or 3 styles drove g35 just a few days ago power is the only thing worth mentioning design inside and exterior  far from perfect to my taste no offence to all owners of g perfect engine much faster than my 325\\nmike blueguydotcom ehhhthe pantheon isnt in paris it is in rome it is the great domed hall with an oculus as for stylingi totally selected the tl as it has similar side lines to my bmw 7 series and there are so many sculpted edges which i only found during a wash for instancedid you all see the trunk where there it is concave and u shaped alsowe only have been talking today about the exterior styling where it excels especially to the g35 is in the interior design and execution btwgeezwhere were all the tlers when i was getting chewed out on this forum during friday if you want to burn 50k and a toyota welli would suggest looking at a gs430 with the 43l that produces 300hp as far as exterior styling goes i used to prefer the tl to the g35 but now i prefer the g35 maybe its the subtle changes to the 2005 model the tl is a handsome vehicle but something about it doesnt evoke a luxury feeling maybe its all the creases and sharp edges or maybe its a psychological thing because i know its heavily accordbased the g35 is not as pretty as the tl but it looks more like a luxury car to me now the interior is a different story the 2005 g35 has improved a lot but the tl still wins hands down except for the plasticky fake wood if you really have 50k to burn on a car i envy you i would go for a boxter i would try to dig out a few k more to get a boxter s now the interior is a different story the 2005 g35 has improved a lot but the tl still wins hands down except for the plasticky fake wood my wifes tl has brushed aluminum with the black interior looks very sharp with respect to the exterior i think the g35 sedan exterior is nick but conservative almost boring the coupe on the other hand the coupe looks great on design what do long time followers of 3 series design and performance think about latest iteration of 3 does 3 have still have classic style or is it heading toward generic hmm its a little more bland the sides are too slab and unbroken the old cars thick breaking lines and bisecting angles help give the car more edge original e46s had the best look the facelifted e46 lost some of the cars angle and chisel cant say im real in love with the look of my 330i never owned a car i found real attractive though have tl and g35 designsstyles left 3 series in dust well the poor g35 also suffers from slabsideitus the has absolutely nothing going on really anywhere they tried with th facelife to infuse some right angles in the front but its the sides of the car and the tail that lack any character at all its far too smooth  too 1980s for me the tls flying wedge design seems more audi mixed with alfa than the sexiness of the original acura legend that car still draws my eyes every time i see one much like the second gen integra and vigor still make me look cant explain it but the tl almost seems like some wacky european film set designer for a cheap scifi film said i vill make future car and out popped the tl with its hard angles square taillights and rectangluar exhaust ports long low wide and most spaceshippy in that dark gray color i see it and think of dr evil saying with pride what do you think of your quasifuturistic car mr powers 3 series except front looks like korean or japanese compact i guess that you can still have a good performing car such as wrx but dont have to have good styling thats what drives my purchase the exterior of the car doesnt influence my purchase for gods sake i owned a protege until last month people will still buy it for performance which is understandable but will close eyes on styling some auto magazine writers also not so excited about new 3 style im not closing my eyes it just doesnt matter to me i cant grasp the rancor over the gto or the hype surrounding the solstice the same question comes back but how does it drive the mustang gt reminds me of the only version of the stang i ever felt anything visceral for the stocker but the cars suspension set up and engine make me dubious of the car sure one can mod it to look like something out of road warrior but how does it perform thats the end all and be all of the equation back to workfun break blueguydotcom ehhhthe pantheon isnt in paris it is in rome it is the great domed hall with an oculus oh really hmmm the buidling i walked by daily for work wasnt the pantheon\\nso i imagined the building its name and the places i noticed around itlike the odd big of graffiti in one alley written in english all part of my delusions weird its like im ed norton and i imagined an entirely alternate reality mr google says maybe im not crazy httpwwwaviewoncitiescomparispantheonhtm ill talk to a friend in france tomorrow and ask her if her office isnt 3 blocks from a figment of my imagination if you want to burn 50k and a toyota welli would suggest looking at a gs430 with the 43l that produces 300hp thought he wants performance if so m3 for brutal all out fun 545i or m45 for good fun gs430 if hes 60 the tls flying wedge design seems more audi mixed with alfa than the sexiness of the original acura legend that car still draws my eyes every time i see one much like the second gen integra and vigor still make me look cant explain it but the tl almost seems like some wacky european film set designer for a cheap scifi film said i vill make future car and out popped the tl with its hard angles square taillights and rectangluar exhaust ports long low wide and most spaceshippy in that dark gray color i see it and think of dr evil saying with pride what do you think of your quasifuturistic car mr powers lol very funny post p i thought the design of the car was fantastic and a nice departure from japanese conservative design it has a definite alfa influence as well as some bmw features i usually dont car about the exterior look of a car but this car knocked me out then i checked out what this car has to offer in performance and lux features i found it to be the best value out there regardless of price english lesson  the word pantheon has at least 5 definations look them up while you may have walked pass a pantheon in paris the pantheon is in rome perhaps the 3 series has outgrown me what was once a willing accomplice for backroad rowdiness seems all grown up it no longer whispers lets go out and risk a moving violation it is now a perfectly pleasant responsible companion if value is the criteria it may not match the infiniti g35 or the lexus is 350 which goes on sale in october and while no one can accuse the new 3 series of not being fun to drive it may no longer hold the clear edge that it once did sounds like nyt isnt all that wild on 3 the battle between it and is and nextgen g probably will be very close too close for bmws comfort httpwwwnytimescom20050724automobiles24autohtml8dpc however its amazing that bmw is still able to hold the small luxurysport sedan crown the fact that the competition has caught up is mostly because they are trying to implement a lot of the same ideas look at the last is300 i dont think that the i6 was a mistake look at the g35 infiniti took almost an american approach viz more horsepower theyve been trying for years and years if they didnt start putting the heat on then id be worried its not that the 3series isnt the best drive or that it isnt the most fun its just that bmw got a little out of hand with the pricing bring it down a few ks and theyll be raving again hmm time for my styling critique 3series the older ones look aggressive kind of like theyll jump out and take a hunk out of a passerbys leg the curvier shape of the new one looks a little blobby still a hell of a drive though g35 suffers from what i call lack of style namely that it doesnt have a lot going on especially from the side view where it looks rather like a loaf of bread thats the coupe the sedan looks classier especially in black but still not a heartstopper cts no comment p is talking about the new one it looks classy but kind of boring not in a bad way but it looks like a lexus better than the g35 or cts but i honestly think that the tl looks better or rather its a mood thing the tl is the wacky little sister who listens to new age and the is is the adult sis who listens to soft rock tl a little crazy but it works i like the fact that honda took a styling chance when they didnt have to kudos i like the way it looks weird this car however does not look as good in black as most of the others probably since a nice silver would accentuate its creases better a4 the front end looks good  i like the new grille the back doesnt too boring  the original post was about the parthenon not the pantheon and the original parthenon is in athens greece you know the rundown one if you want to see a restored version travel to nashville tn they have a very nice replica okay now back to your mindless bickering about style i agree with almost every thing you said but disagree with your opinion about the g35 coupe i think its a knock out in terms of style i dont think its style is as bold as the tl yes the g sedan is a classy looking car but sort of too conservative for my taste interestingly i think the g coupe looks great in black but i think the tl looks great in any color but i prefer the lighter colors the tl is the wacky little sister who listens to new age lol from the front of a tl you can see a definate alfa influence and from the side a bmw influence im sorry take some reading comprehension courses httpwwwaviewoncitiescomparispantheonhtm quote on top of the montagne stegeneviève not far from the sorbonne university and the jardin du luxembourg the imposing panthéon looks over the quartier latin that is the name of the building the word is capitalized and everything  just as i used it yes its modeled after the roman building the portico with large corinthian columns was modeled after the 2nd century pantheon in rome  regardless i used the correct name and wrote it correctly no big deal just dont get up in my face if you dont take the time to do any research there are several disney properties around the world the decrepit one in anaheim may have been the first but if some cat says he went to disneyland in japan are you gonna flag him for it screaming no no its originally in california man lighten up have a pop tart is the pantheon as fast as the bmw m3 p i think the best sportscar you can get with 50k is a corvette beautiful fast in every aspect of the word and a relatively good daily ride too i love the tls styling i look at it from the front and the headlightsetup reminds me of ford mustang from the side its bmw m5ish and from the back  well i dont know what it is from the back but it looks nice and i think the trapezoidal  exhaust pipes are cool shades bytheway delmar sorry i didnt have your back during the tl slam event mad i left work early and have been doin the husbanddaddy thing til now anyway ive decided to stop replying to the tls are accord comments yes its based on an accord but its better in so many ways that the educated consumer wouldnt think of them the same im bored with the whole argument and bytheway the comments of whether the tl was girlie was disgusting and you should be ashamed beautiful is beautiful  and there are fast women drivers just like there are fast men drivers i drive much faster than my wife but she taught me to drive a manual tranny what does that tell you about her or i nothing the tls a beautiful car for any driver i think it looks kinda tough and my mom shied away from it for that reason but i wouldnt love my tl any less if my mom had one its one of the few cars that truly balances luxury and performance shed get it for the luxury features including the logical voicerecognition thatd make her carrides more enjoyable i got it for that too but more for its power and handling anyone categorizing a vehicle as girlie or otherwise needs to grow up and define themselves by more things than what they drive or the size of theircar i would be concerned about the vettes reliability but the vette has a lot of wow they have a convertable with 500 horses p cant agree more taxesquire  they made up a girlie category or they have to rely on feelings because they cant bash the car in reality real world they cant deny all the factsnumbers blueguy  changed you mind about tl ended up in a ditch all cars can get smoked while getting inout of a corner but tl will smoke them again in 57 secs hey at least i have a fact not just feeling 57 bmw rwdundepower understeer speaking about getting smoked g35 rwdoversteer tail out  you get smoked too tl fwdlargely devoid any torque steer remedy dont leave you hands off the steering wheel while cornering\\n well i get smoked too the vette is a very tempting car especially because i am not that old yet and i would look good in it my dad had the last model vette and absolutely loved it he also had no mechanical problems and he drives cars harder than anyone i know btw dont know if they still have the manual convertable top but if they do it shouldnt scare you  very easy to do  even faster than the electric ones i think its also gotten very good writeups as being a very liveable sportscar that the restyled vettes got rid of the popup lights is a huge plus to me its a beaut although your dad had no problems that is only a sample of one and not something i would take seriously i have to do more research on the car before i can make a decision i was not considering the car unitl i saw your posts now i am going to research the car big time its a beaut no kidding p okyou are partially correct regarding the pantheon as i have visited both locationsand not a figment of your imagination howeverthe location in paris took on the literal definition of pantheon and named after the roman temple pantheon is defined as a temple dedicated to all gods or a public building commemorating and dedicated to the heroes and herioines on a nation generally when people refer to pantheonthey refer to the ancient temple located in rome see the below link httpwwwgreatbuildingscombuildingspantheonhtml yesthe paris building was built after the rome temple if you look at your links fourth paragraph it indicates the portico with large corinthian columns was modeled after the 2nd century pantheon in rome sorry for the history lesson everyone yes but two seats low in the utility value unless of course the back seats arent needed and then you have to deal with the less than stellar interior compared to some other sports cars the original post indicated the two criteria of 50k and toyota if you remove the requirement of toyotathere are plenty of choices m3 i would go with the 5 series myself sorry blueguydotcomi didnt mean to impose and get up in your face and even posted further until i saw your latest response hey folksi have been posting on this forum since late this past week some of you thought i was bashing and all just to clear the airnoi was not flaming or bashing the g35 all my comments were straight up and honest and as factual as i am aware just some people dont want to hear the truth or can appreciate an alternate point of view thereforei even gave up on the topic of discussion as it is falling on deaf ears alrightyi vented any howif you folks havent been to paristhe latin quartier is great  and take the subwaysone of the best around the world he said fun that negates toyota p wish they hadnt axed the second gen mr2 that was a fun car del no problem i dig europe i was just talking to a friend last night about parisfrance and italy shes trying to convince me to fly back there soon but we originally made plans for march when i pick up my e90 for euro delivery of course im now reconsidering the e90 because of bmws inability to fix my e46 thus maybe ill get a used g35 new miata or a new tsx to hold me over for a few years until the m3 sedan shows up goodglad you understand one last travel tip for the folks hereespecially those that like to travel you have to consider visiting china the foreign currency conversion is incredible why pay the 30 premium for euros when you can still get 15 discount to the usd incredible to see not only the historic and ancient china ie terracotta warriors of xianbut to see the incredible industrialization i never seen so many cranes in action in any city all the major cities and with thatyou all can understand how the price of gas is going up with their consumption cars therethe worst  freeway traffic in shanghainever seen anything like it and they tax the heck out of you for licenses from what i understand back to the tl talk let me ask againthe tl interior since the focus has been on the exterior i still say it is one of the best in the category thoughts love audivw interiors then bmw then mb then tl finally g35is300 i like interiors that are cold remote and not the least bit cushy im odd like that most silver tls have a black interior with a brushed aluminum finish very cool and not at alll cushy you would love it and then you have to deal with the less than stellar interior compared to some other sports cars as with all cars in this discussion theres a balance between sportiness and comfort i dont believe there is any vehicle faster than the corvette in terms of straightout accelleration and handling that also has a better interior design guess my suggestions for a sporty toyota would be a lexis sc and probably the upcoming is has the celica been redesigned recently i know the eclipse has and it looks very cool the vette is an awesome machine but i suspect reliability problems typical of most american cars been in the black tl the seats are too soft on tlg35is  too couch like for me i like the taunt hard leather used in audimbbmw hate the leatherette as it too is too soft and compliant actually there are plenty faster than the vette but not at that price point there are also some cars faster than the vette that are much less expensive as in the evo but since you qualified it with disclaimer regarding the interior ill just say the vette is a niche vehicle with two seats taxesquire the lexus sc is a great suggestionbut i believe they run in the 60k to 70k range i havent shopped thembut that is my understanding as for if the celica has been redesigned lately i believe it is going to be redesigned this coming year speaking of toyota i was out for dinner tonite and saw a scion tc scion is a brand from toyota and that car is a spitting image of the g35 coupe same jelly bean look could you point out the couch observation for us i believe you like the firmer seating areas found in the german cars with less leg support couch  sit down and the soft seat allows your body to sink in so now the seat material is pressing all around you youre not sitting on the seat but rather the materials claustrophobically sucking you in and providing zero support youre on a fluffy cloud  say like sitting in my grandpas park avenue when i was 13 i greatly prefer firm seating my couches were custom made so that i sit atop the leathernot down and wrapped up in it same with the leather in bmwsmbsand audissit atop the seat less leg support my 330is lower seat cushion extends to under my thighs nicely if you mean lateral leg support i have no idea what that would feel like im fiveseven and 145 lbs so i cant comprehend jokes about narrow airplane seats or the g35s controls digging into the thighid have to grow by a factor of two to have my thighs ever touch the lateral thigh supports on any cars seats thigh support laterally is about as odd and unfamiliar to ma as the idea of sliding around on leather seats had my 330i sideways and i never budged shrug if it were me i would buy a new vette but im 16 and i love fast cars if youre worried about mechanical problems give it a break because if you buy a vette youre worried about getting a ticket how you look in the car how fast you can get home before your wife notices you are driving the car without her in it and how fast you can top it out also the man who said an evo can out run a vette has lost his mind you are comparing a 400 hp c6 or the new 500 hp z06 to a 271 hp mitsubishi evolution and last but not least my stepdad has an is300 and the seats are not couchlike at all they feel good yet are firm enough for aggressive driving given the option of a wrx sti or a vetteits sti without any hestiation the cars near unbreakable itll seat 4 delete the useless rear wing and youve got a fairly sedate cruiser but also a monster of a car additionally it doesnt come with the freudian baggage of owning a vettewhat would be next chest hair gold chains and hang glider collars the new evo can hit 60 in 46 seconds i dont believe a vette is that fast im with you on that get rid of the rear wing and if it were me i would buy a new vette but im 16 and i love fast cars lol if i had a vette when i was 16 i would be dead a long time ago p  couch  sit down and the soft seat allows your body to sink in so now the seat material is pressing all around you youre not sitting on the seat but rather the materials claustrophobically sucking you in and providing zero support actually softer seating provides better support than firm i found this out when bedshopping it was pointed out that softer beds that conform to your body are better at supporting your natural archescurves whereas firmer beds force your body to conform more to them regardless having switched from a passat interior is very similar to audi to a tl i understand what you are saying and while the tls seats dont bother me i agree with your assessment re sitting on the seat v in the seat you might want to check out cadillacs offerings and see what their seating is like i dont recall how bmws seats were but in general german cars have firmer seats if the pricesize ratio german cars in the same pricerange as their japanese  american counterparts are generally smaller eg bmw 3series audi a4 v tl g35 cts isnt working for you you might want to look at the vw passat youll lose some handling but the new one should put out about 250270 hp you could try to find a used passat v8 too and have the seats you prefer again im only suggesting this if the german cars with the seating you prefer and in the entrylevel price range are too small i prefer the softer seats especially on long trips but i dont think the bmw seats are not that firm and they are comfy tax driven the ctsway too caddy soft for me in everyway that car doesnt even rate on my scale of entry lux cars as for the passat im a former vw owner the new one looks ginormous and in my experience with fwd passat the cars so far afield of the handling i like it might as well be a pinto for someone looking for space and semiluxury the passats grand fwiw my 3 series is too big so a lexus ls or avalon are not on your short list the vette can hit 060 in 42 sec in the c6 coupe and in the new z06 that will hit at the end of this year can get 060 in 34 or 36 sec i cant fully remember but an evo cant do that also an evo is awd and thats why its so fast it will only top out at 155 or so a vette is rwd and can top out at 186 for the c6 and 200 for the new z06 i doubt a evo can do that and i had a 1995 pontiac trans am and i havent died yet my friend had a vette when he was 16 but his dad sold it and bought him a 2002 pontiac ws6 and he isnt dead im an american muscle man but i hate vipers and mustangs but im quite fond of lexusnissanand subaru i like acura but the tl was a mistake it is a 270 hp fwd they put tire that are more wide on the back than the front plus it has really bad torque steer the car is pretty though i like sti but there to showy 300 hp but no top speed like the evo it can handle good and take off good but nothing stands close to thew vette for the price i like the sti better than the evo though oh and go to motortrendcom and look up fastest vettes they have a c5 that can hit 060 in 197 sec and can top out at 226 mph like your post except for the statement i like acura but the tl was a mistake it is a 270 hp fwd they put tire that are more wide on the back than the front plus it has really bad torque steer rear tires are not larger than the front and while the torque is significant on a 6mt from standing position its not significant on downshifts and others have commented its not severe on the automatics great post but i dont think the tl was a mistake it sells well handles well and pretty quick plus cr and c  d noticed no torque steer in the at i know at aint cool but so what p oh and go to motortrendcom and look up fastest vettes they have a c5 that can hit 060 in 197 sec and can top out at 226 mph but that wouldnt be street legalat least here my tl can be street illegal at any time i dont need a vette to break the law p more than thathow much were the mods to that car i think he missed the point than sti is a sub 5 second car right now with a few k in mods itll get down to that 4 second mark and be at least 10k cheaper than a vette yea the sti can seat 5 its fast and its pretty it also has has 300 hp but subaru put everything they could put on it turbocharged cold air intake mass air flow sensor so you cant put 10k in it unless you to bore and stroke it and put nos in it so it really isnt worth it when you can have an awesome sports car without having to take the life of the car away and having a vette gives you a whole new level of respect folks lets get back to our subject vehicles  they are listed at the top of this page in the what is this discussion about line if anyone wants to set up a comparo involving vehicles which are not listed there feel free check the search features on the left to see if something that suits you already exists if you find one that is archived click on the link to it and then follow the directions at the top of the page if you cant find one just click here and fire it up pat the corvette is chevys only performance vehicle and with a hardtop you could say its got 3 doors so i think it fits right in with our entry level performance sedan cmon pat  work with me pat is correct we cant include every car sorry pat the following changes have been confirmed for the 2006 g35 1 optional rear active steer package same as the system on m3545 sport\\n2 sport package now includes a new front fascia and side sills\\n3 revised led tail lights\\n4 new bixenon headlights\\n5 bluetooth wireless on all models\\n6 memory seats all needed changes nice a friend of mine just got rid of his 2003 g35 only complaint the car warped brakes constantly i had a nissan that did the same thing since its groundbreaking redesign in 2004 the acura tl has solidified its place as both the top selling acura and bestselling luxury sedan in the country the tl comes equipped with a 32liter vtec v6 engine a drivebywire throttle system and an available closeratio 6speed manual transmission with limited slip differential for 2006 a tire pressure monitoring system is added to the tl146s already long list of standard safety features as are two new exterior colors  tire pressure monitoring system tpms\\n revised engine management system and steering angle sensor logic help reduce torque steer\\n new colors\\no royal blue pearl replaces abyss blue pearl\\no alabaster silver metallic replaces satin silver metallic\\no deep green pearl discontinued new horsepowertorque ratings 258 horsepower sae net rev 804 at 6200 rpm 233 lbsft of torque sae net rev 804 at 5000 rpm claimed horsepower is going down this laypersons explanation theres a new way to measure hp and this new calculation is resulting a lower number dont know whether theyre taking into account ground friction wind resistance or what the sae has basically revised the rules on how hp is measured on the dyno to try to make the numbers more realistic iow they try to keep the dynogeeks from cheating a bit to get their numbers up this has already been done in the past back in my early days in the industry 1960s engines were tested on a dyno with everything possible done to maximize the horsepower this included running with open pipes no air cleaner no accessories ie power steering pump or alternator no fan etc etc if you look at the old hp ratings of 60s and 70s muscle cars youll see that 350  400hp and more were common ratings by todays standards with engines realistically dressed out these engines would be rated 100  150hp lower for people in the habit of thinking about sae net horsepower or old musclecar enthusiasts accustomed to sae gross numbers looking at realworld rearwheel horsepower can be quite a wakeup call this 1970 charger makes an excellent example its 318 was factory rated in 1970 at 230 horsepower sae gross but on the dyno it came just short of 150 horsepower corrected rearwheel as a very general rule rearwheel horsepower on a manualtransmission car is about 15 less than sae net and rearwheel horsepower on an automatictransmission car is about 20 less than sae net for the 2006 model year all acura horsepower and torque specifications have been updated to reflect revised society of automotive engineers sae j1349 rev 804 net calculations that went into effect in january of 2005 since that went into effect in january could it be possible to effect the g also im also thinking of switching from a passat to tl what was your experience with the tl the bmw 325i is tempting but i always go with the practical car and reliability is important the 2006 passat sounds good also too many decisions i love my tl and i never regret switching from a passat to a tl that being said let me be nitpicky 1stly i had a passat glx 5mt meaning it was a 6 cyl engine with all the amenities standard i now have a 6mt tl w nav i believe the passat is gonna have about 250 hp so its s will be comparable to the tl and it might even have more lowend torque it could be faster 030 no way the passat will handle as well as the tl though making the tl a lot more fun to drive both interiors are well done  the tl seems a notch above even though the passat had real wood and the tls is fake if youre going manual transmission the tls is by far more enjoyable i love the early clutch engagement and it shifts very smoothely as far as luxury features that i use its pretty close the tls nav makes it much much better than the passat imo but if youre comparing nonnav vehicles other than a 6disc changer im not sure what luxury features the tl has that the passat doesnt one is that the tls lights shutoff automatically also i like that the tl doesnt have a loud ding to let you know youre low on fuel id often find myself driving where the tank is just at the cutoff level and the light would go on and off dinging each time i also like the tls autoac better for some reason the passats would always be 1 level too strong for me the 1 thing that drove me crazy about the passat was the steering wheel radio controls the buttons should be on the left and the station changer should scroll the presets  vw got it backwards here are some things i miss from the passat the key integrated fob tl uses a separate fob and regular key electric foldin mirrors rear sunshade rainsensing wipers also the passat had nicer computer controls bc 1 there were 2 sets of settings tl has 1 2 you didnt need to take your hand off the wheel to scroll through the options 3 the passat gave you more info on each screen 4 the tl makes you hit a display button to display mpg ave mph etc as far as differences that arent good or bad the passats seats are more firm the tls are softer frankly from what iv heard of the 06 passat it might be a tough deciding between the 2 but id expect the tl to give you a better value bc passats will probably go for msrp initially to sum up if you have a topoftheline passat and enjoy it but want something a tad more luxurious and a lot more sporty youll love the tl if youre all about comfort and convenience but wont get the nav it might be close and there will be some things you miss about the passat hope this helps sorry its so long wow theyve done a nice job leapfrogging the midsize competition too bad i dont trust vw to run pretty sweet car from all ive read one questionit seems no dsg with 20 or v6 one thing i might add in the passats favor i just moved from a 2000 glx to a 2005 g35x the passat can come with awd something the tl doesnt have if it did the tl might have been my choice instead of the g35x excellent post i think you helped the person that was on the fence hey with my 50k i want to buy a car confuse  but im not sure if i should buy the is250 or is350 please advice mei need good advices please with your 50k the 35k tl is the best value on the market no kidding my advice wait until they the new is that is are actually available for you to test drive and compare against others that may meet your criteria you have 50k do you want to spend it all acura rl infiniti m mb e350 bmw 530 jag stype lexus gs430 for 35k you could get several cars that can favorably compete with some 50k cars eg acura tl infiniti g35 bmw 3 what the heck saab 93 its free to test drive and im a saab guy with the money leftover from your 50k you could buy me a new breitling or maybe a girardperragaux id even settle for an omega test drive both of course then decide for yourself but i should point out that the is350 wont be available with a manual transmission so if i was forced to choose between either of these two id take the is250 without hesitation and regardless of price but thats just me what do you mean by next car i agree laurasdada i am not that impressed with those more expensive cars p we can all give opinions based upon our knowledge and preferences but you specifically asked for good advice yet you gave us no facts is this a 3rd car that youre just gonna drive on windy roads on the weekends is it a commuter vehicle thatll be left outside at a train station every day commuter vehicle thats driven 2 hrs mf and not on weekends family hauler if i had 50k to spend on a car i would get the porsche boxter s 53k i would not even bother with any lexi for 35k you could get several cars that can favorably compete with some 50k cars eg acura tl infiniti g35 bmw 3 the new 3 series 330 tested in mt stickered at 47k yeah with every stupid gadget on earth a 330i with 6 mt leather sport pdc metallic paint moon and xenon  40500k sticker or 38500 with mild negotiating bmw charges extra for metallic paint how much do they extra do they charge for a steering wheel or tires p you would not be able to aford it so does audi and they have the best looking colors go figure actually the bmw colors are very good have not seen many audi colors i like very much saw a light blue rl that really knocked me out today i wish the tl would have the same color i think the 2005 g35 coupe and sedan is the best of the best in the entry level luxury performance sedancoupe market  infiniti g35 vs bmw 330i  i have a 2003 g35 coupe before the redesign and i am looking to buy a 05 06 model  went to infiniti first to see what the trade in would be and i was pleased  anyway looked at the infiniti g35x loaded and it was just over 40k  i was so impressed  great features and the new interior is very nice seats are supportive and the dash is much better looking power tilt and telo steering wheel intell key bose rear recline seats are just some of the great opts not to mention the 280 hp 35 v6 under the hood great car all around \\nthen traveled 10 mins down the road to bmw  walked in and was welcomed and hounded anyway about the car  the 330i is not worth the money i looked at a nearly loaded 330 for over 52000 and was so so dazed  i asked the sales man 52000 for this  he said sir it is a bmw i said listen no 3 series is worth 52000 except for the m  so he asked if i wanted to test drive  sure i said so i drove and i drove finished and still wasnt impressed for the price  so what didnt i like 1 price 2 exterior styling 3 thumpy ride 4 and the 255 hp engine  for 52000 i think i would get more then 255 hp  figure a loaded infiniti m45 sport is around 57000 the difference is closer there then it is between the g and the 3  so if your gonna pay 52000 for a 3 go look at the m45 with a 335 v8 and then reconsider a name plate    so for the bang for the buck contest along with fun to drive contest and just about every other contest the g comes out on top except for the 3s interior is nicer suited\\nboo bmw  sorry bmw fans but when someone says entrylevel lux perform sedans i think 30 to 40 range not 45 to 55 range i agree with much of your post but why all the caps ivory 1 stop yelling 2 50k for a 3  a 3 with a lot of silly junk on it like laser cruise active steering neither is available on a g35 active cruise adds 2200 active cruise 1200 navi 2k power rear sunshade 600 so take off every item on the 3 that is not available on the g35 yes the 3 will still be more expensive but what youre comparing now is a grapefruit to an apple not an apple to an apple so glad we are entitled to our opinions\\nyou pay over 40000 for a car that should be no more than 17000\\ni will be thrilled to pay 50000 for a car thats worth every penny\\ninfact i paid 4880000 for my 330i and its worth every penny\\nhave fun with your g35  i will with my class act bmw\\nisnt life wonderful check out the rt review of the g35 vs 330 while the g35 won in some performance categories the 330 had faster laps on the track hp is not everything but i respect your opinion after all its your money for another opinion check out the 905 mt comparison of 330i g35  a4 delivering bmwcompetitive performance and handsome looks for about 85 of a 330is base price makes the g35 a remarkable standoutif only a second place winning standout which means 330i were returning to you your crown ps 330i with sport  premium package msrp at less than 42k ps 330i with sport  premium package msrp at less than 42k ps the premium package is expensive and worthless just get the leather and save your money on the extra silly doodads from the premium package the bang for the buck not everyone wants their vehicle to go bang if youre partial to fuel economy and you think that 200 hp is more than enough than the 325i equipped with just the sp and a 6speed manual tranny will provide you with plenty of that fun to drive factor plus its less expensive than the g35 not to mention the 280 hp 35 v6 under the hood what youre talking about a car equipped with an automatic transmission you simply have no idea what fun is i thought the g sedan was cheaper than almost any bmw however the g coupe i am not sure but the g coupe with 298hp is a powerful machine that bmw has trouble competing against says who the hp numbers on the g35 arent the end of the story having driven both very hard i can say without a doubt the chassis of the fm isnt up to e46 standards obviously the e90 is even better are you talking about the g sedan or coupe i found very little diff between the 330 sedan and coupe but a big diff between the g coupe and sedan i know this is a sedan comparo so i agree that the bmw sedan is superior but coupe versus coupe i dont think the 330ci is superior to the g coupe i try to forget i ever had the misfortune of driving either the g35c or 330ci not my bag i am surprised these are great cars sedan or coupe what is your bag surprise the coupes have too much chassis flex and in the g35c outward vision is compromised too much it makes the bmw seem almost pleasant for outward vision almost btw youre not gonna catch me calling either car great great would be some mythical blend of perfect comfort poise power handling reliability cant say bmw or infiniti has all of that great would be some mythical blend of perfect comfort poise power handling reliability cant say bmw or infiniti has all of that the tl does poise and handling  not to my liking in a tl its too heavy too big  wrong wheel driven and way too soft for me i know you love it enjoy i agree that describes the tl perfectly p the tl too big i guess some would think so try an 06 is might be a good fit but i think its too small or the is350 is missing a key ingredient manual ill still try one itd take something mighty persuasive to get me into a runofthemill automatic if the car had a dsgstyle tranny then itd be a total contender for my dollar but a straight automatic if the is350 loaded costs 30k then id seriously consider buying one with a craptastic automatic otherwise the drive is just to quiet my curiosity a car that sporty with no mt thats strange and i think a mistake 2006 330i

packaged with comparable options as far as i am concerned my infiniti g35 is worth more then 17000  what makes your bmw worth more  is it because it is german engineered  there is nothing special there esp since infiniti ranked  1 in relibality i believe last year  could be wrong  blueguydotcom sorry about the caps but i dont know just didnt bother to switch well anyway even without all the crap there is still a difference in the price between the bmw and the infiniti  a nice size one  and the bang for the buck yes i understand not everyone is looking for that and either was i and i dont need too but as far as i am concerned i will continue to buy into the infiniti name plate because they are great looking cars great acting cars relibale cars and worth the money and if it was all about a name plate my three car garage would have mercedes  benz written all over it  but then agian it is just an opinion  one last thing you have to remember that the new 325i and 330i was aimed at the infiniti g35 and that the g35 was aimed at the older 2005 and before model therefore i think there will be a crown toss between infiniti and bmw for many years to come not to say acura and audi and mb wont come out with future great products  also with the great new manumatic type trans i believe that the autos are fun to drive and have that universal appeal of highway driving and city driving its great  stuff i want 330i 6 mt with leather sport package metallic paint power seats xenon series 7stereo moonroof  40k\\ng35 6 mt  with sport package premium package bose stereo power seats moon  35k shrug dont have any use for bmws premium package to each his own i see a 5k difference for me id rather pay 5k extra and be happy im not happy with a g35sits too high snap oversteer isnt my bag engines rough shifters not that great as i am concerned i will continue to buy into the infiniti name plate because they are great looking cars great acting cars relibale cars and worth the money quite reliable theyre a tremendous value for price to performance also with the great new manumatic type trans i believe that the autos are fun to drive and have that universal appeal of highway driving and city driving its great  btw i probably wont be buying another 330i bmws inability to fix an engine problem ive had for 3 months means im gonna take a break from bmw m3s probably the only way ill end up back at bmw have a nice evening 1 you failed to note that the steptronic in the 330i is a sixspeed whereas the g35 is a fivespeed 2 the premium package is full of interesting gizmos 3 comparably equipping cars is subject to personal tastes so its no more a persuasive argument that simply insulting the other guys intelligence\\ncompare the price difference between the base

to get the price down for those of us who dont want bloated cars 25000 off for going with the manual thats ridiculous the dealers dont improve things every g35 on every lot within 100 miles had the premium package yeah with the g you get more car whether you want it or not the new 325i and 330i was aimed at the infiniti g35 the new 3 was aimed at drivers despite what the ads may imply bmw isnt interesting in copying others  only improving on what came before its infiniti and lexus who feel compelled to aim at a competitors product also with the great new manumatic type trans i believe that the autos are fun to drive believe that all you want but you wont convince me or many other stick lovers they just arent there yet did anyone ever say that bmws are cheap it is more expensive to get the bmw or mercedes model with the same content either you think the car is worth the extra money or you dont infiniti and lexus have made their mark by making mercedes and bmw substitutes for less money i dont think it is news that their cars have lower prices is it 325i not drag racing for pinks so excess engine output is just increasing our dependence on imported oil and shrinking my wallet 330i gets better gas mileage than the 325i p a car that sporty with no mt but its got those cute little paddles lol  i think its a huge joke all the advertising given to the autoshift mechanisms whether its paddles steering wheel push buttons or on the gear selector theyre all nice for a change of pace and maybe to slow down without using your brake but thats about it it may get better mileage is certain conditions my commute is partly 10 miles of fast acceleration and stomp on the brakes this is not your grandmas epa gas mileage test this type of commute is the worst of the worst in terms of gas mileage the 330 does not have better mileage in conditions such as i described dunno i do know if im a good boy i can get mid to high 20s in my commute on long freeway drives i get killer mileage 30 really its only because i like to live above 4k rpm that my daily commute only nets me 22 mpg i kept my 318ti at a low boil 4500 rpm the whole time well up to cruising speed anyways  then i start using those throw away gears 4th  5th and still got 30 mpg i think that with the way i drive im getting better mileage in my e46 325i than i would be if id gotten the 330i at least i hope so otherwise id have to kick myself and im just too old to contort my joints that way a car that sporty with no mt thats strange and i think a mistake a manual will be available on the is250 just not the is350 which means that if you told me i had to choose between a 6speed is250 and a paddle shifted dsg is350 id take the is250 without hesitating even if they were the same price infiniti and bmw have made great cars along with lexus and other cars in this class but as far as i am concerned i like the infiniti line up they are great cars with just what i want if i wanted the 330i or even the 545i i would have just went and bought one they didnt appeal to me so i didnt buy although the bmw won its crown back i would still choose the infiniti  its just what i like even thou i am now looking at the lexus gs430  good car  i have never bought a lexus i like the new is350 also do you think i should wait or go with the gs  i also believe that bmw does look at other cars when designing  if they didnt what info and other stuff would they have to go by not saying they dont make there cars better but i am sure they do look at other cars while in the process making  ooo and you forgot about audi   again with the manumatic trans types vs manuals  it is all up to who wants what what your driving conditions are and who is driving the car first of all i have city and highway driving and the manumatic trans is great  if i am traveling on the highway i can throw it into manual mode and have some fun  if i am driving with my parents in the city and there is stop and go traffic the auto mode is great so the manumatic trans is best for me  then my wife doesnt know how to drive manual trans so i cant buy one cause we usually switch off cars  the coupes have too much chassis flex  i am very surprised to hear this in my experience the coupes have almost no chasis flex this is because the fm platform is really solid and the coupe bodystyle further reverses flex you can read reviews of the g35 and the 350z which has the fm platform as well and most of them even one review that slammed the 350z say that the fm platform was great and allowed no chasis flex or squirm as i said that has been my experience as well especially now that i am driving the car in the pothole filled streets of la i find that the chasis does not twist and squirm even when i hit the big potholes it is possible that the car you drove had something disconnected or lose that made noise which sounded like chasis flex the problem is that the fm platform is made out of steel so it makes the car comparatively heavy it is not that heavy compared to other cars of its class but it is a pig compared to small sports cars ie s2000s and miatas the g35 would so much better if its body was made of aluminum but i am sure that would make it much more expensive too and in the g35c outward vision is compromised too much that is only true in the back and you can get good vision in the back if you are very careful about setting up your side mirrors but i admit this car definately needs bigger mirrors perfect comfort poise power handling reliability for me the g has everything sans the comfort the comfort is not perfect due to the hard suspension i have a coupe with all suspension packages but it is not easy for a car with good handling to have perfect comfort actually it i pretty much impossible but th g coupe is very comfortable for a car that handles the way it does if the is350 loaded costs 30k it wont the 350 will be expensive probably in the 40s decently equipped there will be a cheaper version is300 or 250 was it which has a choice of manual but it will have a weaker 215 hp engine dont be confused by the 300 hp engine  the is 350 will not be a sports or sporty car because no lexuses are the lexus strategy is luxury and isolation from the environment that is exactly the opposite as a sports car which must strive to make you one with the road so i am not at all surprised they do not offer a manual they are just not selling to the sports car buyer they are selling to the person that feels good about having a 300 hp car but does not drive it hard or care about how it handles rather heshe cares mostly about the luxury ie it will be aimed at the same demographic as the tl hey i also agree about the price if you head to wwwlexuscom and look at the new is video it says that the is250  the cheaper model  will start around the same price of the current is300 which is about 30000 if correct maybe more  then you figure the bigger engine extra equip and the base price of the is350 will be around 36000 loaded an est of 44000 which isnt bad for what you get 6 spd auto with paddle shift mark lenvinson sterio and navigation back up camera and much much more  lets just hope the rest of the car is as great as the technology which it prob will be since it is a lexus  what i disagree on is the buyer they are looking for  i believe that this vehicle will be in the demographic of the 325i  330i and the g35 they also mentioned that it is sharing some components with the bigger gs but will be sportier lets keep our hopes up    which means that if you told me i had to choose between a 6speed is250 and a paddle shifted dsg is350 id take the is250 without hesitating even if they were the same price the is250 is a dog thougheven with a manual it cant get out of the way of anything it wont the 350 will be expensive probably in the 40s decently equipped there will be a cheaper version is300 or 250 was it which has a choice of manual but it will have a weaker 215 hp engine i know the is350 wont come in that low i was making a pointthe is350 would have to be stupid cheap loaded for me to get one with an automatic i think 44k is a little too high you can get the gs 300 for that yeah but the kinda person that would want a gs300 wouldnt seriously look at entry lux they want a land yacht not a performance sedan the is250 is a dog thougheven with a manual it cant get out of the way of anything have you driven it from what i understand the is is closer in size to the 3  a4 as opposed to the tl  g35 so it doesnt need as much hp to move the is250 is a dog thougheven with a manual it cant get out of the way of anything feel free to engage in a little hyperbole to make you point i guess einstein was right everything is relative but 200 hp in a 3400 lb vehicle doesnt sound too shabby to my ears why the 05 v6 mustang not the v8 is said to be faster than an 84 corvette i had a 50l v8 mustang 82 that put out a whopping 158 hp oh boy we live in interesting times oh and technically the is250 isnt out yet so you should refer to its performance in the future tense the is250 will be a dog why the 05 v6 mustang not the v8 is said to be faster than an 84 corvette geez i think our 38 liter v6 dodge grand caravans are both faster than a 1984 corvette in a straight line that is so a 2005 v6 mustang beating that same vette should be no trick relative to the is im thinking it is a tad overweight for the size of the vehicle true i havent seen it yet however it is weighing in at over 150 pounds more than an e90 325i and it sounds like it has a smaller interior in terms of legroom than anything else in the class consider the following vehicle  total leg room  vehicle weight\\naudi a4 20t  7560  3362 lbs\\nbmw 325i  7610  3285 lbs\\ninfiniti g35  7720  3512

and technically the is250 isnt out yet so you should refer to its performance in the future tense the is250 will be a dog the is250s are available to mags have been tested judged and found deficient ive seen numbers in the 8s for the awd model egad and yes its all relative in my eyes if a car costs over 30k it better do 60 in less than 7 seconds in my eyes if a car costs over 30k it better do 60 in less than 7 seconds good to know that bmw 325i 323i 328i 525i 528i 530i 535i 728i 730i 735i 735il 740il 750ilv12 are all dogs i made my self clearin my eyes is a pretty individualistic phrase good to know that bmw 325i 323i 328i 525i 528i 530i 535i 728i 730i 735i 735il 740il 750ilv12 are all dogs lets see 323 328 over 30k maybe 5 years ago 528 535 728 730 735 740  old school also and defunct do they still make a 525i my god that engine was hell enough in the e46 even the new e90146s 30 325i is nothing to shout about maybe i146ve seen the wrong stats but manual 325i146s and manual 530s make the run to 60 in under 7 seconds if you146re talking steptronic cars or usedold bimmers\\x85well those are not exactly the sort of car i146d go anywhere near i stand by it 150 if i pay over 30k the car better make it to 60 faster than 7 seconds that146s not asking much when 24k jetta glis and 25k a3s can run to 60 in the low 6s mags are showing 060 of 79 with the is250 thats a dog cd has it going 062 in 73 does that make it a greyhound engine specs werent finalized but we managed to extract figures from chief engineer suguya fukusato that are pretty close the smaller six will generate about 220 horsepower and 184 poundfeet the larger six should pump out a healthy 310 horsepower and 266 poundfeet no official acceleration figures are available but our unofficial stopwatch clocked the is350 at 59 seconds from 0 to 62 mph in stark contrast to the 25liters 73second sprint power is instant and progressive offering a far more compelling experience than its predecessor we hit an indicated 165 mph in the is350 and 149 mph in the is250\\nlink still id take it with a stick before id go with the auto is350 i think the gs is the least attractive car in its class and is not very agile if you146re talking steptronic cars or usedold bimmers\\x85well those are not exactly the sort of car i146d go anywhere near its highly doubtful that you can shift faster than the steptronic consistently dayin and dayout under all circumstances how often are you on the race track anyway do you keep your car for only one year i dont think a twoyear old 330i is worth 30k in any case the current dog list apparently includes 325ci coupe 7181\\n325cic convertible 7789\\n325xi wagon most probable\\n330cic convertible 697569 how many of us can shift the manual as fast as the smg bmw

not sure most would agree that brand new 3series coupe z4 and mini are dogs the objective is not always to shift faster it is to shift appropriately  skip gears engage the clutch really really softly

scene sorry just feel the is250 is a major let down and whomever keeps writing 220 hpgive it up lexus sae numbers are 204 hp 185 ftlbs httpwwwthecarconnectioncomvehicle_reviewssports_convertibles2006_lexus_is_250_is_3   50s184a8929html and yes bmws 325i is already using sae as if this matters but i know somebody will bring it up no and i agree that the is250 will be a major let down with prob the slowest times in the class my mistake faster then the saab 93 linear the base model which is cheaper and the car is like built for safety and then a mercedes which is based more on luxury i have no idea what youre quoting you seem to have a mixture of mag test results and manufacturers specifications to make it interesting lets start with the fastest time the mags have recorded e90  330i 56 seconds you can take it from there httpwwwalbeedigitalcomsupercoupearticles060timeshtml even at the above website the 2001 e46 was recorded at 61 the objective is not always to shift faster it is to shift appropriately  skip gears engage the clutch really really softly whatever its called a manual for a reason it requires thought participation  and experience oh and they almost never break and when they do they dont cost 2k to fix when this latest generation of wannabe manuals becomes well and truly reliable itll become an interesting discussion its not yet good god another newbie driver discovered the religion of manual fyi i have clocked over 150k miles on manual cars with two burned out clutches to boot what does the merits of manual vs automatic have to do with what i was saying are you sure you can shift as fast as smg i know i cant even after 150k miles on manual cars if you can not then a car that is rated for 69 060 for manual and smg will be slower than 7 in your hands its as simple as that skipping gear and thoughts have absolutely nothing to do with 060 the shifting points are precaculated for that drag run and it will be an exercise in reflex 3 years i keep my cars three years the vast majority of 3 series three years or younger would be considered dogs in your scheme of things makes a lot of sense doesnt it the vast majority of 3 series three years or younger would be considered dogs in your scheme of things makes a lot of sense doesnt it it does make sense explain why it doesnt i dont worship at the temple of bmw show me an e36 and i wonder about the m3 sedan e46 been there done thatfamiliarity breeds contempt e90 i wonder when the m3 sedan or supposed 335i turbo will appear ive drawn a line for me personally that line  060 below 7 seconds merits consideration anything over that marker  dead to me why does that trouble you so much good god another newbie driver im sorry did you check his profile or something did he check the newbie driver box otherwise quit with the insults fyi i have clocked over 150k miles on manual cars and ive clocked over 312k miles 500k km on manual cars and never once had a transmission failure nor have i had to ever replace a clutch despite having 112k miles on one car are you sure you can shift as fast as smg strawman argument no one here has made that claim but you keep arguing against it skipping gear and thoughts have absolutely nothing to do with 060 and going 060 has absolutely nothing to do with his original post again no one here is claiming that manuals are inherently faster 060 than automatics but if your interest lies in keeping the rpms at a steady boil when braking into a turn youd be better off picking your own gears and finessing the clutch than fighting with the transmission as it tries to upshift when you let off the gas the shifting points are precaculated for that drag run and it will be an exercise in reflex taking the joy out of driving is not my idea of progress thank you for your support and well put in the bargain newbie well ive driven 11 million miles and most of it was in vehicles with manual transmissions the 95000 that wasnt is why i feel so strongly about never having another automatic mg two miatas 240z kenworth truck  one of the very few lincoln lss produced with a getrag manual extinct now as it turns out those who prefer to do their driving in a straight line with max acceleration the only criterion clearly have a different point of view well i know that list is not completely accurate because the auto version of the s60r comes nowhere close to even 6 seconds let alone 54 thats the 6speed version the auto is much closer to 7 secs due to the decreased torque in the first 2 gears the question remains what in the world does the advantage of manual at keeping the engine at boil have anything to do with 060 numbers taking the joy out of driving is not my idea of progress whats the joy in 060 drag racing if there is none to begin with how can any be taken out bluedotcomguy and were discussing 060 under 7 being a requirement for any car being considered remotely sporty if your argument is that straitline performance is not as relevent as handling you are actually in my corner those who prefer to do their driving in a straight line with max acceleration the only criterion clearly have a different point of view then you are siding me with in my discussion with blue i was pointing out that there are many decently sporty cars with slower than 7 060 the tranny part only came about because imho the auto tranny rating is closer to what most drivers will actually get for 060 even when shifting manual on their own because they can not shift as fast as smg or professional drivers that makes a whole slew of cars slower than 7 in the hands of their owners all those 6569 cars whether manual is superior to automatic in driving experience was never part of the discussion how about 060 merging onto an expressway from a red light straighline performance in this instance is very relavant how about increased gas mileage there is a reason autos typically are slower than manuals and get worse gas mileage can you say torque converter xsgs are the perfect medium for those who are interested in maximum control of the cars manual or smgs are the way to go discussing 060 under 7 being a requirement for any car being considered remotely sporty i thought he said in my eyes if a car costs over 30k it better do 60 in less than 7 seconds agree with him or not thats a pretty clear statement of his opinion  and one that didnt mention anything about a requirement for sportiness its not about what the driver can do its about what the car can do so im not sure of your point autos vs trannies are an individual preference the amount of fine tuning a driver has over a car is best with a manual but the driver does more work but in the end the driver can only do what the car is capable of doing i think you misunderstood what blueguy was saying he has stated in other posts that he holds cars like the miata and tsx in high regard both are sporty cars that post 060 numbers above 7 seconds but they also cost less than 30000 30000 is simply a line he has personally drawn in the sand in a day when cars are as powerful and quick as they are today its not unreasonable to desire a 30000 vehicle that achieves certain benchmarks would you not be a little embarassed when you stomp the go pedal at a fresh green light in your brand new 33000 slush box 325i and the honda odyssey next to you with 2 kids watching shrek 2 in the back pulls ahead and changes lanes in front of you whats the joy in 060 drag racing if there is none to begin with how can any be taken out bluedotcomguy and were discussing 060 under 7 being a requirement for any car being considered remotely sporty uhuh i never mentioned sporty i simply called slower to 60 cars that cost over 30k dogs if your argument is that straitline performance is not as relevent as handling you are actually in my corner i want both yeah a gen 1 miata in the twisties was a hoot but you and i both know that same car with 200 more hp would have been absolutely exhilirating hit a tight 270 degree 15 mph corner and with a manual and a decent engine im going to be a happy camper cost to fun ratio i can snatch up a new miata loaded for 2425k thatll put a grin a on my face because it doesnt cross that imaginary line of 30k now that most autos in this category are 5 and 6 speed automatics it wouldnt surprise me if pedaltothemetal on a straightaway they were faster than their manual cousins due to human limitations though tests dont seem to show that as being the case i feel confident that a 5 speed automatic would be clearly faster than a manual of the same car driven by myself blush but taking out the human error is what makes the car less sporty its not so much whether you can lay out the dough to buy a fast car  its whether you personally can make any particular car operate at its best regardless of whether that means keeping rpms down to stretch every last ounce of gas or running right up to the redline id think id get more satisfaction out of maximizing the hp in a manual 4 cylinder honda accord than just slamming my foot down on an automatic porsche boxter think about nascar  the argument that its not a sport is based on the fact that it mainly involves machines and the best machine will win pronascar arguments revolve around the human interaction  when to slow down when to accelerate when to block an opposing car the pit crew etc automatics take a level of involvement out of the equation and lessen the sport of the whole thing not sure why you are addressing that to me are you saying a person merging onto an expressway from a red light will be able to shift faster than heshe otherwose would be able to do i dont get it the discussion was never about manual vs automatic but whether the published automatic rating or mnual rating for 060 is more relevent to what most owners actually get almost no one can shift a manual as fast as smg dah thats why they invented smg in racing few can shift manual faster than a modern automatic for that matter therefore what people actually get from their car are closer to the cars automatic 060 rating not the manual rating when driven by professional drivers whether manual or automatic is better for personal taste is entirely a different story altogether depending on your driving condition etc would you not be a little embarassed when you stomp the go pedal at a fresh green light in your brand new 33000 slush box 325i and the honda odyssey next to you with 2 kids watching shrek 2 in the back pulls ahead and changes lanes in front of you thats been the fact of life for many 325i owners for years substitute v6 accord for the odyssey and you still get that today with the new model i would be embarrassed if that were to occur also thankfully today it wouldnt i would be embarrassed if that were to occur also thankfully today it wouldnt really v6 accord is a lot faster than 325ci the sport coupe especially off the line my mistake i am sorry i should have paid more attention to where i was getting the info from but for the most part they are pretty close numbers the volvo s60r does not go 060 in 54 with the auto but it is in the low 6s i would guess having 300hp even with the torque cut out on 1st and 2nd gears uh do you think saab will ever make a worthy sport sedan  i read an interesting explanation the other day about why mag testers such as cd can usually get better 060 times that the manufacturers rating it has to do with exactly how the measurement is taken apparently most of the magazines use a technique that was developed by the nhra the drag racing sanctioning body where they start the timer when the car has moved one foot  not at the exact instant of when it starts to move now you might ask how big a deal one foot is but you would be surprised how long that takes  it is of course the slowest one foot of the entire run especially considering what it takes to overcome the inertia of geting the car to start moving as another example i used to drive a frontengine dragster that would run the 14mile in about 75 seconds one time though i popped the front wheels so that they went over the starting beams and i started the timers with my rear wheels instead of the front wheels so i basically got a 170 head start on the clock my elapsed time on that run was 68 seconds which would have been good for a world record if it had been a legitimate time also about the 060 times 56 seconds for what the 6spd manual 330i  well in the new comparo in the automobile mag says that the new 2006 bmw 330i 6spd does 060 in 61sec that is slower then the infiniti g35 6spd going 060 in 58 sec then the last one was with the 6spd caddy cts moving 060 in 65 sec you know what you can cite all the comparos in the world it doesnt change the basic fact the infiniti with a bigger engine more hp and torque cannot really outgun the 330i so you can cite this comparo ill cite the other comparo really you think you should see them race unfortunately i have accord loses mine is faster than both of them anyway some mags pop the clutch or use torque braking while the numbers the mags get usually are representative of the best times you could achieve you will rarely hit those numbers unless you wish to damage your drivetrain i think though its important that each mag sticks with their established method so one can compare times however i would never do a full torque brake launch with my auto tranny um face the 6spd infin will blow the doors the god darn bmw 330i but then bmw has one thing infiniti dont the mclass kd no comparo ever has timed a 330 quicker to 60 than a g35 i agree with you that the g has a bigger engine more power etc but the fact remains that the g is quicker to the 330 and with around a 10k advantage too the gas mileage sucks but you gotta pay somewhere again a v6 accord stick would out gun any 325 stick to 60 not comparing the cars in any manner accord coupe has been timed in the high 5s to 60 by many magazinestesters the bimmers are not just about 060 numbers more about ridehandlingsteering wow really i never knew that the v6 accord coupe was that fast  it only has 240hp doesnt it  i also think that infiniti g35 also has great ride handling and steering the only thing infiniti lags is a great appointed interior and that german heritage the infiniti even with almost 50 hp more than the bmw still manages to be a mere 03 secs faster to 60 mph and through the 14 mile i dont know about you but i cant tell 03 secs from the seat of my pants and dynamically the 330i blows the g35 away in terms of ride steering and poise the g35 offers tremendous performanceluxury bang for the buck but in my opinion the 330i is the superior drivers car well i think the g has great ride even thou i have a 03 coupe but when i went in for a scheduled service they gave me a g35x and the ride was great i also test drove the 330i also good ride handling and overall goodness to put it in short terms but i also believe that infiniti did an excellent job on the g and even thou i could go and buy a 750i i wont i am comfy in my g isnt this the point in the conversation where somebody is supposed to mention wholly outside the context the subject mind you the wrx sti is there any luxury in that wrx sti  didnt saab and sub merge or somthing  hopefully subaru can give saab the performance they need wow its in the handling the infiniti really lost me wish the g35 felt more planted to the tarmac not sure what heritage means regarding cars theyre just cars they exist right now i dont believe cars have heritage or cache lol my point was trying to be made that people think that german engineered cars are superior to japanese and american cars  bmw does seem to manage to do more with less less power i read somewhere that the bmw ceo said that they are not going to shy away from the hp war but it doesnt seem that they are taking that route in most segments today bmws are lagging behind other makes in hp  torque figures though like i said earlier they are able to get more out of what they have i am looking to get a 325 in the near future and went to take a peek a few days back the car looks gorgeous to me but the rear seat is too small and low for an adult to sit comfortable and this is a requirement for me i will go again this weekend for a second look and then decide does anyone know the engine sizes for the bmw 530i and bmw 545i  i was just wondering because i believe motor trend test results had the 545i pull ahead of the infiniti m45  i know the two engines in the infiniti m class are 280hp 35 v6 and a 315hp 45 v8 did you bother to take a look at the new lexus is350 on the internet it will be out this fall also did you look at the g or the saab  look at everything before you make a decision the 05 545i has 325 hp the 06 530i has 255 hp there is a new 550i coming out soon to replace the 545i but im not sure of its horsepower rating i read somewhere that the bmw ceo said that they are not going to shy away from the hp war but it doesnt seem that they are taking that route my take is they are not shying away from it but youre not going to see a high powered engine in a 30k automobile regarding some 060 times i will grant you some mags post impressive times from autos you wouldnt expect so i amend my statement to read the bmw will loose them as soon as the other vehicle goes to turn the wheel so the benchmark 5 does have a bigger engine then the benchmark m i wondered why the 5 was faster i love the 545 and was going to buy one then saw the interior and it turned me off  i believe that the 530 is a 30l and the 545 is a 45l yes good point as much as i love german engineering i just cant wait to get an sti that will be my next car forget the luxury i want to beat you guys to the next stoplight i purchased an infiniti g35 lemon soon after they were released it was in the shop for 69 days within the first 8 months of ownership nissan was horrible to deal with in any respect i like to think of it this way mcdonalds can hype up their hamburgers calling them premium like they do everything and the numbers are there to support it  you get 6 whole oz of beef  a whole ounce more than the competition but then you realize the competition is a 5 diamond restaurant offering a burger as well  you can see where im going i recently purchased a new 3 series it easily makes it way to 100 without the steering wheel shaking as in the g the wind doesnt whistle through the cut rate seals on the doors as it did in the g and finally when i brake i get smooth modulated pedal action which brings me to a quick stop in the g the whole car shook from the severely warped rotors which they tried to fix on more than 5 occasions so if you value smooth and quick acceleration a solidly built car and powerfully smooth brakes by all means spend the few extra bucks and purchase the 3 if you can live with the fact that you paid almost as much for a car that is manufactured by a company whos claim to fame is the sentra  and you dont mind cost cutting measures literally surrounding you  choose the g in defense of the g it is probably the car that comes the closest to the bimmer as far as handling but it has a long long way to go before many people would choose it over a 3 series i believe that bmw doesnt have horsepower as a core value they rather span out and try to make everything a little bit better not just one thing in there case handling ride ect i couldnt believe it the lexus is350 with a 35 v6 pumping out 305 hp and 275 lbft torque i believe they want to win  my take is they are not shying away from it but youre not going to see a high powered engine in a 30k automobile you would think he meant having the highest hp in every segment it competes in they want to win  if you dont like the hp in the new 3 and want to win you can certainly wait for the new e90 m3 with the 400hp v8 if thats to tame you can get the m5m6 with the v10 i think the 545i is actually a 44 litre and the new 550i will be a 48 litre i guess 544i and 548i just dont roll off the tongue 530i  30 liters  255 hp  220 lbft\\n545i  44 liters  325 hp  330 lbft\\n550i  48 liters  360 hp  360 lbft best regards\\nshipo well yeah but if the is doesnt handle as well as the bimmer they arent going to get those buyers i also purchased a g when they were first released and had to wait for it  4 months actually and i never had one problem well actually one but it was the rear fold seat latch that broke no biggie i guess you did have a lemon and every car manufactor does except maybe the exotic hand built cars infiniti also was  1 in relibality 2003 i believe and where was bmw  not in the top 10  guess that takes care of the horsepower wars if what lexus said about the is350 is true bmw is going to need more then what its got to remain king of the class  thank saab for that turbo  well i have a feeling infiniti will sneak attack with a bad nonpermissible content removed sedan version of the gtr coupe did i hear a twinturbo v6 with 450hp in the air  you can also expect an early redesign of the g esp with all these new releases in the class coming out  what will this turbo six be putting out you think  i think no more then 335hp then youll have the new m3 with the v8 doesnt matter we passed up my budget right around 215 hp p not sure they get 333 hp out of the current m3 with a 32 litre straightsix so i dont know why they couldnt approach 350375 hp with a turbosix its a poss i think the new gtr is going to be overpriced thou they said in the 70s which i dont know if i would pay  what will it be up with the m6  the class is defined by much more than 060 times im not entirely convinced bmw has sweaty palms worrying about some car companies that japan cooked up in the late 80s and early 90s and lets say one bmw exec does  i would guess hes probably head of the m department i think the fact that lexus has only one vehicle which we can really consider performance oriented while bmw has not only numerous performance oriented vehicles any of the larger output engines on all series but several super high performance vehicles m3 m5  m6 indicates that lexus is trying its best to get a foot in the proverbial door thats about all lexus has managed to get in so far did you bother to take a look at the new lexus is350 on the internet it will be out this fall also did you look at the g or the saab  look at everything before you make a decision the is350 has a much smaller back seat than a 3 series the g35 is best if he wants room saabuh why is a saab mentioned in the same breath as rwd cars if its sporty it belongs in this thread youre not discounting all automatics as opposed to manual transmission vehicles are you i purchased an infiniti g35 soon after they were released it was in the shop for 69 days within the first 8 months of ownership nissan was horrible to deal with in any respectif you can live with the fact that you paid almost as much for a car that is manufactured by a company whos claim to fame is the sentra  and you dont mind cost cutting measures literally surrounding you  choose the g in defense of the g it is probably the car that comes the closest to the bimmer as far as handling but it has a long long way to go before many people would choose it over a 3 series i can say the same about my 330i 4 months and bmws current solution for the common 30 4k engine hesitation is rather draconian they disable the second set of valves so the engine loses top end power but it no longer hesitates they said to me with a straight face great ive been to bmw 4 times in 4 months and this is their solution for a known problem with the 30 engine every company builds some problem cars i am sorry i should have not say the company as a whole but i am pretty sure that the is350 will be a good contender against the 330i and the g35 yes bmw was around a lot longer then any of the japanese auto makers but it doesnt make them any better  is mercedes  benz better because they were the first auto manufactor  i believe that bmw has more then sweaty palms figure infiniti gtr is going to take the m6 and then a high performance version of the m45 with the same tt450hp v8 will take the m5 the infiniti flagship is holding them back then all they need is a couple of converts and you got yourself a full line up ready to go head to head with bmw give it to 2008 figure infiniti gtr is going to take the m6 and then a high performance version of the m45 with the same tt450hp v8 will take the m5 by the time the gtr comes around bmw will be out with a 600hp monster of course you may be paying 6gallon to fill up the gtr or 600hp monster but thats another story what a company has done in the past helps its future im sure you would like to see bmw lose but its probably not gonna happen as far as mercedes as a car company they still build the best cars to get in the drivers seat with the widest variety as i said previously on these boards if mb is going downhill then why do i see so damn many new highpriced mbs in my neighborhood did he say he needed rwd maybe he lives in snowy climates the saab will plow thru the snow while the rwd is350 and the 3s rwd and the rwd infin will be stuck in the garage look at the acura tl too awd g is great also i figured low 300s because of the new m only having 400 ponies yes but there 600 monster of a car will be a lot more then 70000  the price will more like be 170000 mercedes is not going down hill  i never said that most of the people in my neighborhood drive mercedes we should really categorize and prioritize problems my infiniti was undriveable at times  leaving me stranded often which makes the problem with your 330 pale in comparison i would have at times given anything to experience engine hesitation at 4k i was put into a rental car that in order to maintain pace with traffic and not pose a hazard had to pretty much stay above 4k at all times the law firm who handled my lemon law case repeatedly told me that infiniti was the worst company to deal with i was turned down by several attorneys who when they found out my car was branded infiniti wanted nothing to do with it call a lemon law attorney and drop the name infiniti and watch them run they are hell on wheels meanwhile i was in the court parking lot the day i received my handsome settlement even the devil himself sometimes gets caught and when he does boy do they make him pay and guess who shows up in a m3 the corporate attorney for infiniti i guess actions do speak louder than words lets start somthing new cause i am tired of talking about bmw thats funny because when my scheduled mantaince comes around along with the time the fold down seat broke i received a current infiniti model and i know the the g35x or the fx45 they usually give me is not working its nonpermissible content removed off to keep up with highway traffic usually it is the highway traffic trying to keep up with me  one more thing wouldnt he be representing nissan corp since nissan is the parent company i got tired of talking about them before i bought 2 german cars blush\\nits funny because after i got my first i couldnt stop talking about them if you want to still talk about cars in the class may i recommend another top performer that now deserves a little newfound conversation the mb c350 i just got the e350 and the engine is great i can only imagine it in an even lighter more nible car yes the new engine 268 hp v6 right  sounds great when i looked at them the engine was awful small  that was a big turn down  i got a complimentary dodge neon from the 90s from my lovely dealership oh i lied one time they gave me an old sentra to drive around in for 36 days im not sure about traffic struggling to keep up with me confuse but i was struggling to justify why i was making payments on a g and driving a neon dont get me wrong i did like the g i just got a big lemon and now i have to vent i shouldnt be mad infiniti did practically pay for all of my new 3 but it is good to hear that they are actually treating their customers with the respect and good loaner cars that they should well then i must be a special customer because i always get current infiniti model cars infiniti of willow grove  yes they are treating me good  i just ordered a ivory pearl fx45 for my wife  i will be done financing my g35 coupe in november  i am going to buy another infiniti then too maybe a lexus or mercedes i dont know yet  did he say he needed rwd maybe he lives in snowy climates the saab will plow thru the snow while the rwd is350 and the 3s rwd and the rwd infin will be stuck in the garage look at the acura tl too awd g is great also ill wait for the snowliving rwd owners to refute your 1980s thinking about rwd cars and snowy climates sorry but my brothers 330i is horrible in the snow  he lives in maine when it snows he cant drive his 330i so his wife drives him to work in her saab 95 last time at infiniti a lady was trading in her g sedan for the g35x because she couldnt drive it in the snow as for me i have the luxury of having 3 cars  sorry but my brothers 330i is horrible in the snow  uhhu not buying my bet is that its not the car its the tires if his 330i is horrible then it has the summer performance tires which bmw overtly states should not be used in the winter if his car does not have the sport package and has the oem allseason rubber then you are overstating the case my first bmw was a 328i with almost identical rubber as a 330i nonsp and while it wasnt the best car ive ever driven in the white stuff it was certainly capable of getting from point a to point b with a minimal amount of fuss i then got a 530i sp and yikes that thing was horrible in even a bare dusting of snow remember i stated its the tires well i put a dedicated set of winter skins on my 530i and prestochango my car went from the worst winter car ive ever driven to the absolute best fwd cars included whats that you say i dont live in maine youre right i live in new hampshire and over the last three winters weve had over 300 inches of snow through it all my 530i only stayed in the garage when the snow was so deep that it would have been nothing more than a snow plow if id taken it out that said six to eight inches of rutted snow was no problem even with all of the undulating roads vertically and horizontally that we have around here best regards\\nshipo the subaru wrx sti has awd 300 hp and costs  oh never mind yep shipo comes around when ya need him yes he does have the sport pkg so he prob didnt think about tires he is a little air headed after all his wife is the money maker cause he doesnt have enough brains to make money anyway  the lady at infiniti thou had 17s and they have the all season rubber i believe and she said her car is bad in the snow oh never mind what  all i stated is that the sub wrx sti doesnt have creature comforts but is an excellent performer  a grand performer  for the price it is great if all you want is other people to see your tail lights then that is the car for you  they should have give you at least a maxima  saw that one coming i would certainly hope so you left an opening for me large enough to pilot the queen mary through  best regards\\nshipo i dont need creature comforts anymore give me a grand performer sti here i come bmwe90 sorry for your bad experience with the initial version of the g35 i just bought a 2005 and believe that significant improvements were made in the last two model years that doesnt excuse the problems you faced or excuse infiniti for coming out with the g with so many initial problems at least with your car but the conversation on the bmw3 vs g35 is interesting but really i think the two cars serve slightly different targets for me the 3 series was just a little too small and a little too expensive to meet my needs if i valued absolute performance over all other considerations then my choice would have been similar to yours i dont think the new 330i blows away the g in handling but it is a better handler with the 330i you get better handling and the bmw badge with the g35 you get better straightline performance more interior room and about 7000 left over of course nothing beats the lancer evolution or the impreza sti if you want the most performance for the buck in a sedan with the 330i you get better handling and the bmw badge that is the bmw badge arent the lancer and wrx pushing 30k these days if i had to do it over again i would not have purchased the g35 but if you asked me if i made the logical and practical decision at the time  i would say yes of course from what i gather from the many happy g owners on this board infinti does in most cases provide a great handling midsize car for a good sum of  less than bmws 3 series if i hadnt had my sour experience with infiniti and i were in the market for a sport sedan  and money was a consideration as it is for most of us the g would definently be on my shopping list the higher price of the 3 series does pose a problem for some buyers in this category and at any rate the g provides more interior room than even the new 3 i agree with you that these two cars are serving different targets but those targets arent too far apart i did spend 35000 miles behind the wheel of my g before it was gone i have spent about 4k miles in my new 3 and the cars each have their strengths  along with very few weaknesses i will give you guysgals my honest opinion of each car ill pretend for fairness sake that nothing was wrong with my g the g was very quick with its 260 hp and torque the car handled well at nearly all speeds but doesnt match bmw for handling at high speeds 90 the bmw seems more at home the harder you push it while the infiniti feels like its up to the task but it does it with a straight face while the bmw does it with a smile the bmw has the better interior hands down quality wise i wont comment on style because that very objective the bmw is a tigher squeeze though and most taller passengers will be asking the driver and font passenger to move up it seems once you get situated in the bmw no one complains from lack of space the infintis rear doors open much much wider than the bimmers though  and the seats also recline in the g the engines are a tossup i think the inline 6 is smoother than the v6 in the infiniti but i will agree that infinitis v6 is probably the second best engine i have ever owned the transmission in the bmw has an extra gear and seems to shift smoother and quicker i had a full size spare in my g and i loved it i dont like the new run flats on my 3 i prefer the bmws brakes though bmw does include maintenance which is nice but not a deal maker in any respect they are both great performers and i think anywho who choses either is getting one of the best sport sedans available in this class the car handled well at nearly all speeds but doesnt match bmw for handling at high speeds 90 unless you are in montana you are not supposed to be going 90 p with the g35 you get better straightline performance more interior room\\nand about 7000 left over yes but u also have to look  a butt ugly car everyday\\nbmw badge is worth the extra 700000 the g sedan is not to my taste but i wouldnt call it butt ugly in fact the g coupe is much better looking than any bmw but looks of a car is very subjective and personal p i have to agree the g is not butt ugly after all if it was vw and audi wouldnt have sold so many passats and a4a6 how about some design originality out there lol great post p i wouldnt call the vw or audis ugly just bland almost like american cars i think mb has great styling and the tl is very original i dont think the comparison was a fair one you should of compared the audi a4 20t to the bmw 325 and not the 330 i wouldnt call them butt ugly but neither the coupe or sedan has the styling panache of the 3 series tastes are very subjective i actually like the g35 sedan over the coupe agree the prestige of bmw for a lot of people definitely worth the extra money besides just think what those chicks think if you tell them you drive a bimmer remember the saying you get what you pay for when did subaru become a luxury car brand have you seen the tribeca or the outback the tribeca while not a sedan has comparable amenities to these vehicles while i never had any objections to the prior versions of the bmw 3 5 or 7 i found them to be clean handsome and functional designs unlike the current mess of odd angles slab sides and added on kit car looking rear ends im not sure panache is a word i would use yesterday there was a pre06 330 in our parking lot with a mazda 3 sedan behind it i actually found the mazda 3 to have a bit more panache the new bmw 3 thankfully has been toned down although the rear is straight off a second gen infiniti g20 the resytled 7 looks significantly better the 5 has grown on me but so did the cts and aztek but only slightly the g35 sedan is ok stylewise im not a big fan of the rear and it seems a bit tall and narrow to me but the g35 coupe like the bmw 3 series coupe i find to be works of art exterior stylewise ymmv while i never had any objections to the prior versions of the bmw 3 5 or 7 i found them to be clean handsome and functional designs i agree exactly with that assessment but i also love the new looks they are very striking and have a great presence the m6 especially is a head turner the new m6 convertible me wants the new designs have taken some bad press but in the real world where people actually vote with their wallets the designs actually seemed to be like it amazes me when i talk to people there are some who didnt like the old but love the new in the end though we all agree that styling is subjective i would like your opinion on purchasing a certified 2004 lexus es 330\\nthe car has 16000 miles and the asking price is 29990 from our local lexus dealership i do not know alot about buying a preowned car could any of you give me some dos and donts\\nthanks i too like the 6 except for the bangle trunk imho inelegant cheap and tacked on looking an afterthought ruins the clean lines the spartan interiors of the 5 and 6 dont particularly work for me either another theory is that with the bmw the looks play second fiddle to other factors such as the overall driving balance of the car or the prestige of the blue and white propellor maybe a potential buyer has to close his eyes when approaching the car   but once behind the wheel it becomes stunningly beautiful and worthy of a few of the buyers hard earned  i wouldnt throw a 6 out of my garage for eating crackers either im glad to see you also posted this in our dedicated lexus es 300es 350 discussion  thats a better place than here for your question when did subaru become a luxury car brand when they started stickering them over 30k once again to remind everyone that we are specifically discussing the 6 vehicles listed at the top of this page i realize the name of the discussion invites the inclusion of vehicles not listed but the reality is that we are restricted to those six because of the interlinking of this discussion with articles on the main site related to only those six vehicles we have been through this many times before so let me try to head off what has happened in the past  this reality cannot be changed at this time and we will not go where weve gone before which is getting mired in how thats not right and what vehicles should be added because none of this can be changed  so i would really appreciate everyones cooperation in keeping this conversation primarily focused on the bmw 3 series infiniti g35 acura tl lexus is 300 mercedesbenz cclass and cadillac cts as always anyone who want to compare other vehicles is welcome to look at the main sedans comparisons list for a suitable topic  if one doesnt exist feel free to fire up a new one thanks unless you are in montana you are not supposed to be going 90 to many of us the law is merely a suggestion p i know on long drives  like sf to san diego or las vegas to san diego i tend to average over 95 mph and get over 30 mpg to boot nothing quite like flying down the empty i15 at 1 am doing 130 its in these trips and the jaunts on backroad late at night that i realize how much i love my 330i another theory is that with the bmw the looks play second fiddle to other factors such as the overall driving balance of the car or the prestige of the blue and white propellor maybe a potential buyer has to close his eyes when approaching the car   but once behind the wheel it becomes stunningly beautiful and worthy of a few of the buyers hard earned  remember you do drive the car from the inside p how it looks on the outside isnt relative to how it feels on the road well unless im the typical customer of an idiot salesmen who told me on a test drive to look at your reflection in the buildings as we pass them see how cool you look gotta wonder if people actually fall for that iagree the prestige of bmw for a lot of people definitely worth the extra money besides just think what those chicks think if you tell them you drive a bimmer remember the saying you get what you pay for zero prestige its a bmw dude not a ferrarilambo the only girls impressed by a bmw are bumpkins and golddiggers confuse prestigerofl i agree the g35 coupe and the bmw 3 series are very nice looking cars well unless im the typical customer of an idiot salesmen who told me on a test drive to look at your reflection in the buildings as we pass them see how cool you look gotta wonder if people actually fall for that as usual you have me rolling on the floor i agree there are so many bmws on the street the badge means nothing actually the g35 coupe and the tl might be more impressive to women because they are far less commen than the bmw p frisco i assume youre kidding guys who depend on cars to meet women confuse lol i didnt bring it up someone else did however it doesnt hurt to pick up a date with a nice looking car besides i am married and dont date other women that much you need to go to the high end luxury forum they dont even consider infinity as a luxury brand my friend again you get what you pay for a lot of people still dont know what infinity or acura is there are a lot of people who aspire to dirve mb and bmw if you dont thats your or your chicks problem looks like even with price over 30k subaru still doesnt belong here as a luxury brand all hummers are over 30k but it is not considered a luxury brand many years ago through a shopping mall parking lot in scottsdale in his fully trickedout corvette ive lost what respect i used to have for some women if i hadnt been there i wouldnt have believed it but i was driving a hot car appears to work in ways that i never knew about then or care about now come to it its an anthropoligy thing i enjoy driving at high speed in very rural areas no people around just like i like it there are a lot of people who aspire to dirve mb and bmw aspire how can you asprie to get a car that leases for 250 a month most of the suvs in my parking lot at work cost as much or more than my 330i if you dont thats your or your chicks problem problem lol i have a bmw its perception obviously where youre from a bmwmb is still considered something different or foreign around here a bmw is no different than a toyonda hey blueguy my 330i will arrive at the dealership on mondaythey had to truck from an outta state dealer i cant help but kinda regret not ordering it i wanted the sport package and bmw assist instead of zpp but that would take 10 weeks so i just went with the zpp instead so my question is does the sport package actually makes the car handle better thanks german cars can only hope to be as good as a g35 coupe especially bmw the g35 298hp coupe is a bmw killer no doubt yeah to bad it doesnt handle as good and goobles gas seems to me the g35 is trying to aspire to be a bmw the g35 coupe does handle as good as the bmw but does gobble gas with a 298hp engine that wipes out most bmws except the mucho expensive m what do you expect if you want to save on gas buy a prius p actually it doesnt wipe out anything hp is not the be all and end all my guess the 3 manual would beat it on the laps just like in the rt comparo it may get to the red light 0001 seconds faster than a 3er but thats about it now if you want to say the 3 is more expensive ill agree but the two cars have different missions in life you may be one of the rare few people that actually enjoys paying 3gallon hp does mean a lot 060 14 mile etc the g wipes out the the bmw 3 i dont mind paying 3 a gallon in california its only a few hundred a year big deal are you so poor you cant afford that if so buy a civic or prius p buy the way those are two great cars hp does mean a lot 060 14 mile etc the g wipes out the the bmw 3 i dont mind paying 3 a gallon in california its only a few hundred a year big deal are you so poor you cant afford that if so buy a civic or prius buy the way those are two great cars if i were you id apologize for that poor statement its totally uncalled for and it will get your post yanked theres nothing sensible about wanting to blow 3 every 18 miles and regardless of your peacock attitude the g35 in autox hasnt revealed itself to be the dominant force you claim here saigon only you can tell if the zpp v zsp v zhp makes the difference for you i found the standard and zpp cars to be a little puffy the sport package 330i was fun zhp more fun in the end even the zhp is too soft for my style of driving what was wrong with waiting 10 weeks youve waited your whole lifewhats 70 measely days okay show me a comparo where the g wipes out the 3 i can show you one where the 3 wipes the g i just ran across thisjust for a break in the conversation httpwwwcaranddrivercomarticleaspsection_id29article_id9902 unless you are a host i am not apoligizing for anything i am not saying that the g35 is dominant just a better value than the bmw i think thats what is really bothering you additionally if you can afford a 35k car poor mileage isnt going to force you into the poor house buying a g35 298hp coupe is not a sensible buy you are buying a great sporty car that gobbles gas you go in knowing that i am not saying that the g35 is dominant just a better value than the bmw i agree its more expensive but everybodys definition of value is different and thats what this conversation is about yes gas price shouldnt matter but the fact is with a smaller engine and less hp and power the 3 series holds its own against the g most magazines consider the new 3 the new benchmark however having said that there are real reasons for looking at other manufacturers bmw has always been the drivers benchmark which is one reason i am interested in them i dont care for the other stuff such as dvda nav etc give me a well tuned creamy smooth vehicle that almost drives me and i am happy i wouldnt throw the g tl or any other car out of my garage if one landed inside i just wouldnt pay for them great post please dont get me wrong i love bmws and i am considering the 330ci and the m3 but i just cant justify the cost over the g35 coupe even though i can afford it for the same reason i an considering mb but i cant get over crs low reliability ratings for the mb by the way cr does recommend the bmw 3 series most magazines consider the new 3 the new benchmark   \\nbmw has always been the drivers benchmark    most magazines consider the new 3 the new benchmark not because of the car itself but because it is a bmw 3 series bmw is not the drivers benchmark its the benchmark for sport sedan marketing e36 e46 and e90 have been significantly different cars getting softer in every generation the new e90 is softer than the e34 5 series what kind if drivers benchmark is that unless you are saying that drivers are a dying species it is a marketing benchmark bmw has been a great marketing phenomenom hosts dont ask you to apologize they just yank inappropriate posts odds are good come monday the post will be gone they dont take kindly to personal insults here i can afford either car the gas mileage matters to me i want 30 mpg when im taking a road trip no the extra stops with a g35 wouldnt make me sell a house or anything but it would make me think twice about going to the movies 25 mile round trip or driving to la its more psychological but its real to me nonethless ill second that blueguy i wouldnt consider an infiniti its no secret that infiniti is poorly engineered any car that needs 35 more gas  these are the realworld numbers i have read to approximate the performance of its competition is poorly engineered and not worth considering imho carlos ghosn arrogantly stated how people do not care about fuel economy he turned nissan around and yet has now left it ill prepared for future times all their models compare poorly in this regard its unfortunate the chairman was not as well rounded as he thought he was on second thought i do apologize i reread my post and it was a very poor choice of words on my part i am sorry what i should have said is that mileage is not that big of a deal for me it may be for others again please accept my apology bmw is not the drivers benchmark its the benchmark for sport sedan marketing e36 e46 and e90 have been significantly different cars getting softer in every generation have you ever driven a bmw if not you should get yourself in for a test drive maybe you have and were unimpressed thats okay with me i dont have to defend the car there are legions of reviews that seem to indicate that bmw has done right with the e90\\nheres one of them maybe they are in the business of selling cars and they needed to change with the times to suit their broadest audience without compromising their mission of the ultimate driving machine yes bmw does great marketing but they also market a superlative product sounds like theres a subtext in your post almost wishing the japanese knew how to do the same thing i hope im interpeted your post correctly as it seems you are trying to say that bmw has these magazines in their pockets while they have their biases they are independent i sort of agree although i wont go so far to say poorly engineered the fact is their engine use much more gas for almost the same performance as some of the compeition and dont tell me to get a hybrid please in general car manufacturers are ignoring the 3gallon price per gas hoping that we wont notice either people who say when you buy a sports sedan you give up rights to good mileage are just blowing smoke bmw and acura manage to squeeze decent mileage in both city and highway the folks i know who have g35s get as low as 1516 the use of the same engine in all of nissaninfiniti models will come back to haunt them i dont have anything against these cars they are all great in their own right what i cant understand is the value proposition people often cite when they buy a 35k car like yep i got a lot of car for my money well that aint so a cars job is to take one from place to place lots of cars fulfull that and dont even cost 15k a 35k car is an indulgence people on these boards often end up heatedly discussion which indulgence is less indulgent as if to justify their purchase but i just cant justify the cost over the g35 coupe  i understand that also many whiles back a honda s2000 owner said of a ferrari why would i want one i got a car that performs almost as well for a fraction of the price and is totally reliable youre the same way the diminishing returns you get from an m3 is not worth it the g and most infinitis  nissans is geared lower than most of the competition so its turning several hundred rpms higher at highway speeds that probably gives it better acceleration in top gear at the expense of fuel economy somehow i doubt most people buying 35000 and higher cars pay much attention to fuel economy though and the difference between a few miles per gallon is only a 3400 per year for the average driver less than 1 car payment these mags are not independent if they take ad money from these companies plain and simple somehow i doubt most people buying 35000 and higher cars pay much attention to fuel economy though  i think today most people look at fuel economy im fairly certain people who buy the 40k rx400h pay particular attention to the fuel numbers i dont understand your line of thinking if you are really concerned about mpg the you really should buy a prius actually the prius is one of the hottest selling cars in the us and that speaks volumes about conerns about gas prices however if you buy an suv or a car with over 250hp says that you are not that concerned about gas prices prius has zero performance though were looking at entry lux sedans in that segment 30 mpg on the freeway is viewed as reasonable as the cars also have luxury absent from a prius handling absent from a prius and power totally absent from a prius i have driven an 04 prius current body style it scared me there was a crosswind and that eggshaped highriding car with almost zero tire connection to the road felt like it was going to flip doing 80 on the freeway was a chore and at that speed  normal freeway speed not even normal long distance drive speed  the gas mileage was less than stellar i can only guess how horrid my mileage would be running 95100 down i5 to sf ior i15 to vegas would it even get in the 30s i know i can get 30 running 95100 in my 330i and the car feels firmly planeted and im only using 23rds of the engines potential so the car still has the gumption to scoot if i need it otherwise its just leisurely zipping along  quiet secure agile still and totally luxurious prius has zero performance though were looking at entry lux sedans that is exactly it we are talking about 3 to 35l 6 cylinder engines that power cars that weigh between 32003300 to 35003600 just a guess at this weight point and engine size there is a reasonable expectation of decent gas mileage if you have the ability to cruise at an even pace down the freeway there also is an expection of reasonable gas mileage if you live in a congested area like i do along with reasonable gas mileage there is an expectation of snappy acceleration and crisp handling the tl and 3 fulfill the expectation of reasonable gas mileage and that is where the g falls short relative to these two cars its just one of the criteria one looks at when choosing a car excellent post if the tl had rearwheel biased awd that would probably have been my choice a4 and 3series are great cars but not quite the size or price point that best suited my wants in this price range as you pointed out we can hardly say needs i think today most people look at fuel economy im fairly certain people who buy the 40k rx400h pay particular attention to the fuel numbers has anyone on this forum posted that mileage was the deciding factor in their choice of an entry level lux perf sedan and im fairly certain that very few of the rx400h buyers will recoup the extra cost in fuel savings and even more certain they dont care they think theyve done something to preserve natural resources by buying the hybrid i think the jury is still out on that i know i can get 30 running 95100 in my 330i with a highway epa rating of 30 and the average speed of the highway cycle at 49mph that seems like a stretch has anyone on this forum posted that mileage was the deciding factor in their choice of an entry level lux perf sedan based on blueguys posts i would think he might i also would when gas costs 125 a gallon it didnt matter much i would think at 3gallon to some people who might have to drive 100 miles a day it may matter i find it really strange up until reading these posts i never thought of comparing my g35 coupe with a 3 series in terms of mileage and i have had my car for over 2 years the manufacturers dont even market them based on the mileage factor imagine a bmw ad get the new 3 series the most fuel efficient car in its class these cars are sport coupes or sedan  not economy cars they are about sportiness that is styling handling power speed ride gadgets and toys even at todays gas prices that is how i still see my g35 coupeeven though i walked away from the pump the last time with a sigh i still powered it down the highway after leaving the gas station i bought my g35 coupe based on styling power ride fun to drive gadgets falls within my budget i like myu cars to have a nice interior but i was willing to settle with the interior of the g35 considering all the other plus factors in addition every other joe in my neighbourhood has a 3 series now that i am seeing the g35 coupe everywhere i go i want to change it again but i would probably go more for a clk because it has really good features and it is not as popular as some other cars and it wouldnt be for the gas mileage confuse you make some very good points that you admitted walking away from the pump with a sighi would imagine a lot of people are doing that nowadays however i guess a question to ask is would current and future gas prices influence your next purchase decision within the boundaries of the entry level luxo sedan forum that is with a highway epa rating of 30 and the average speed of the highway cycle at 49mph that seems like a stretch i dont care if you think its a stretchits reality for most of us who own manual 330is the cars ludicrously efficient on the open road at hyperlegal speeds in 6th gear at 80 the engines not even touching 3k rpm  kdshaprio based on your earlier posts it sounds to me that fuel economy was not the deciding factor at all just an extra benefit it sounds to me that the deciding factor for you was superior performance in a small sedan pure and simple shrug to each his own i buy for the whole package handling power driving positionerognomics efficiency etc at this time im more likely to end up in a miata or s2000 than any luxury sport model as most of them either bore me tl c class is250350  safe to assume considering it lacks a manual cts or i have issues with buildengineering quality g35 a4 330i the miatas razor sharp handling impeccable reliability 30 freeway mileage and low price 26k loaded  or 24k off the lot gets my eyebrow to raise maybe the is350 with auto will be fun i find that highly doubtful to be quite honesti have thought about the new miata as well as my next car after the g35 and i think that too would also be a good buyonly problem would be the 2 seats which was one of the reasons i didnt get the zotherwise the miata is an excellent little ride just an extra benefit klpeelthat is true i acquired my last car when gas prices where in the 160180 range now they are in the 259279 range if i had to buy another car today with prospects of 350gallon for gas in the near future it would be the 3 series i really couldnt see myself changing my g35 coupe for any other vehicle in the class i think i would probably enjoy the all wheel drive in the g35x but i just dont enjoy the style of the sedan enough to make that change strangely enough if i had to switch brandsmodel i would probably take a close look at the tl first because it has a nice style nice interior roomy lots of power comfortable ride nice features and gadgets right price but i am not sure if i could like the handling and the fwd are you really saying that you would buy a 3 series in the future mainly for the gas savings 7000 will buy a lot of gas if you want to say that youd buy a 3 series because you think it is 7000 better than the g fine i dont agree but i can respect that opinion and lots of people agree with you but to say that youll buy a 3 series because you think it will be cheaper than a g that 7000 premium you pay for a 3 series will still buy 2000 gallons of gas even at 350 a gallon 2005 g35 auto 1825 average 215\\n2006 330i auto 2129 average 25 so on average the 330i gets 35 more miles per gallon 16 more gallon than the g35 not surprising seeing as how the 330i has less power and one more gear if you drive 15000 miles per year the 330i will require 600 gallons and the g35 will require 700 gallons so at 300 per gallon thats a difference of 300 per year just the interest on your 7000 savings will get 300 per year i can get employee pricing on a g35and my next car will either be a g35 sedan or 330i the cost of a 330i optioned how i would like is not worth the 7000 premium on the sticker but with euro delivery you can save close to 5000 on that same vehicle now i drive 85 miles round trip a day that coupled with these other 2 factors make the mpg argument in my head a little more interesting will i really save or do better for myself with a 330i because oin the highway i will get 30mpg and with a g35 i will prolly realistically see 23mpg optioned the way i want with disocunts included g35  34000\\n330i 37000 so a 3k difference will that be worth the mpg if you have the luxury of cruising down the highway to get to work the e90 should get you 34 after its broken in i have about 20 miles of stop and go traffic into work so i dont really count on getting good gas mileage gas mileage real world 2005 g35 auto 15182225\\n2006 330i auto 20242934 i would buy a 3 series because its my favorite car the good gas mileage is a bonus yes but just an extra benefit is different from the deciding factor cant be both oops just noticed post 4286 you confirm the extra benifit and disavow the deciding factor by the time you are back in the market for a car the tl might come with an awd option that would also fix some of the handling issues yes my 85 miles a day are 98 highway miles i drive mostly highway miles anyway i live about 30 miles from where i do most of my livingmeaning my freinds and family live about 35 miles away from where i liveso i am always on the road to and from but again my 85 miles roundtrip are all highway milesdoes that really justify the cost difference over a year are you really saying that you would buy a 3 series in the future mainly for the gas savings 7000 will buy a lot of gas if you want to say that youd buy a 3 series because you think it is 7000 better than the g fine i dont agree but i can respect that opinion and lots of people agree with you but to say that youll buy a 3 series because you think it will be cheaper than a g that 7000 premium you pay for a 3 series will still buy 2000 gallons of gas even at 350 a gallon well a 330i with the doodads i want is 40500  or about 355 via ed best i can do on a loaded g35 is probably 32k so really its a 34k difference dont bother mentioning the cost of going to europe got a lot of friends including my last gf there so id make a vacation of it gas mileage real world 2005 g35 auto 15182225\\n2006 330i auto 20242934 sure bc what your friends are getting represents the real world numbers of all g35s and 330is btw i got a friend who got the 2006 330i auto hes getting 20 mpg combined i also have friends and relatives who have the g35 theyre getting 22 mpg combined but im not going to argue with my anecdotal limited sample that the g35 gets better mileage than the 330i sure you can find people on internet forums who complain that their g35 doesnt get epa mileage but you know what every car has some people complaining that they dont get good mileage tls accords 3 series g35 prius etc so for comparison purposes i will take epa ratings any day of the week not the unsubstantiated bmwbiased real world numbers of a bmw owner that is the only way i think i could do it is the euro deliverypretty much cuts off 5k of sticker sure you will pay about 1200 to fly there and back but that is still better then paying the extra 5k euro delivery is really the only way to make the 330i competitive as far as pricing goes with the real competition the g35 is so attractive to me becuase i do not have to do any of that i can get a great price by going to a dealer and buying one but then again gas isnt going to be getting any cheaper in the foreseeable futurethat would def raise my brow to a car that can get 34mpg highway again prolly 75 of my driving is highway miles you can think what you want however i am not the only one who believes the gas mileage in the g35 is horrible if you drive the car as intended as opposed to coasting down a hill in neutral even the epa themselves admits these tests are far out of date so in the end if you want you can believe the 3 series is a gas guzzler while the g35 just leisurely sips gas when i owned my g35 the best i got was about 26 on the hwy i take a 2 lane trek across the state to visit family once a month at about 6065 mph in my 3 series i get over 34 mpg doing the same trek normal driving around town in the g netted me about 1617 while the 3 gets about 2223 the infiniti doesnt necessarily qualify it for a federal gas guzzler tax but its mpg numbers arent good anyway you look at it of course i can think what i want no need for you to tell me that also i never said that the 3 is a gas guzzler while the g35 sips gas so please dont tell me what i do or do not believe you stated that in the real world in general the 330i consistently gets better than epa estimates while the g35 consistently gets worse than epa estimates i am asking aside from your anecdotal friends do you have any evidence to back this up here is what i wrote 2005 g35 auto 15182225\\n2006 330i auto 20242934 here is what bmwe90 wrote when i owned my g35 the best i got was about 26 on the hwy i take a 2 lane trek across the state to visit family once a month at about 6065 mph in my 3 series i get over 34 mpg doing the same trek normal driving around town in the g netted me about 1617 while the 3 gets about 2223 the infiniti doesnt necessarily qualify it for a federal gas guzzler tax but its mpg numbers arent good anyway you look at it seems as if at least one person who i dont personally know is corroborating my anecdotal evidence i am asking aside from your anecdotal friends do you have any evidence to back this up how am i going to have evidence mpg is dependent on a lot a factors some of which we control some we dont thats what im saying to use as a comparison epa estimates are the most reliable source even though they have their flaws i see posters on forums who claim they get 2829 mpg on their g35 while others say they get 1516 mpg as you said there are so many things that we have to take into account like how these cars are being driven tires individual car variations trip computer errors etc of course there is anecdotal evidence that the g35 gets less than epa and the 330i gets more than epa and vice versa the 330i definitely gets better mileage than the g there is no doubt about that it just seems that your real world generalization is way skewed in the 330is favor the problem with the epa it is not real world even they acknowledge it when i car shop i use the epa as a relative guide but i understand my actual mileage might be significantly better significantly worse or on par with the epa estimates while i do believe the results are skewed they are fairly skewed and are more representative of real world results than the epa estimates i can get employee pricing on a g35and my next car will either be a g35 sedan or 330i the cost of a 330i optioned how i would like is not worth the 7000 premium on the sticker but with euro delivery you can save close to 5000 on that same vehicle now i drive 85 miles round trip a day that coupled with these other 2 factors make the mpg argument in my head a little more interesting will i really save or do better for myself with a 330i because oin the highway i will get 30mpg and with a g35 i will prolly realistically see 23mpg optioned the way i want with disocunts included g35  34000\\n330i 37000 so a 3k difference will that be worth the mpg im surprised you have to pay 34000 for a g35 with the employee discount that sounds like the street price anyone could get for a fullyloaded g35 in any case with a 3000 difference id just get the car you like more i understand that the epa test is not often real world what i havent seen any reliable evidence of is that the g35 consistently gets below epa while the 330i consistently gets above epa in other words youre saying that the way that the epa conducts its test somehow favors the g35 again there are posters all over the forums who say that their g35 gets worse at or better than epa there are also posters who say that their 330i gets worse at or better than epa the people who drive these cars know what it costs to fillitup at the pump and what their gas mileage is i have a very small sample size but my sample size might be bigger than the epas whose sample size is one but i do think the mileage ive postulated probably fits under the bell curve with thousands of bmws and infinitis you or i obviously cant predict the mileage of each and every one but i believe im close to real world figures well it is like 33500and that is for a msrp 40000 g35fully optioned with nav prem c sat radioeverything i agree that anecdotal evidence is not really valuable info but in certain cases it can be for instance we all know that the prius does not get anywhere near 60mpg in the city based on the volume and  of anecdotal evidence i have read many forums and both the g and the rx8 get pretty bad mileage anecdotally relative to their epa estimates but i havent really studied the new 3 series the last one was pretty spot on to the epa which one would you like to be seen in there is alot more importance in how you feel than just the initial expensetony gas prices are only going to get higher in the future so mileage with become more and more an issue a reason my wife chose the tl was its good highway mileage and its very low emissions she is somewhat sensitive to enviornmental issues so thats important to her one factor that is significant in my mind is that bmws and mbs and vws and audis are built to obtain their best gas mileage at speeds well beyond what we typically drive here in the usa the epa and their 49 mph test be damned when i was picking up my ed 530i i spent the first 1300 miles or so keeping the car under 100 mph and during that most critical of break in periods i obtained between 26 and 28 mpg for the last sprint back into munich i had the cruise control set at 130 and according to the trip computer i was still getting between 23 and 24 mpg geez my 530i was getting about the same mileage at a buck thirty that a g35 gets at half that speed now being one that habitually refutes anecdotal evidence i must admit that over the last seven years of contributing here in the townhall i seen literally hundreds of posts by bmw 3series and 5series drivers claiming mileage well beyond the epa numbers and precious few that couldn146t once again in my mind that is significant in fact a few months ago in the 5series forum a contributer was complaining that his e39 530i was barely able to make the epa numbers the rest of us kept maintaining that there was something wrong with his car contrary to what his dealer was telling him i mentioned to him that i was aware that there was at least one round of firmware out of munich that was ummm less than optimal and suggested that he have his obc reflashed bingo he immediately started getting mileage more in line with what the rest of us had been telling him he should be experiencing which by the way was well beyond the epa numbers best regards\\nshipo which one would you like to be seen in lol shipo stop making stuff up you know bmw owners are prone to over spend they want to be seen in our blue and white propellor badged cars with matching beanies and we all lie about gas mileage oops did i write we i meant you or they well just wanted to say that i just got my 330i and im loving it and thanks to those that have helped me  blueguydotcom kydfx cant remember everyone but thanks congrats saigonboi21 hey i moved your last post to our ongoing 3series discussion since thats a better place for your question than this comparo  heres the link saigonboi21 bmw 3series 2006 4009 23 aug 2005 231 am enjoy your new ride now being one that habitually refutes anecdotal evidence i too refute anecdotal evidence to me anecdotal evidence rears its ugly head in the form of statements like these i heard all bmws unreliable or i heard the g35s guzzle gas however what i hold near and dear is first hand information anecdotal evidence is taking a small sample size and making unscientific broad predictions based on that small sample size we hear can ignore fact that nielsen predicts the habits of 35million people from 1000 people there is a percentage of people who will hit the epas number because they drive the car exactly as it was tested for the rest of us that dont drive as tested our actual mileage will vary  and  so while im not forming a scientific conclusion about g35 gas mileage what ive seen first hand has me wondering if the mileage could more on par other cars in this category i have a 2004 g35x the awd version with a commute of 30 miles per way travelling at about 75mph i have been avg about 225 miles per gallon i know its not sipping but it is much better than the 13 to 15 mpg reports i have read in the past but i do concede that when my commute has been less say 12 to 15 miles per way that average has dropped to about 18 mpg the car seems to really like the long uniterrupted travel the best at least from a mpg standpoint this epampg discussion is really crazy i drive the bedevil out of my g35 coupe almost all the time spin around corners shifting all 6 gears up and down like i am playing pacman with it low gears and hi revs while listening to that sweet sound coming from the exhaust switching lanes along the highway enjoying all 280 horses of that sweet torquey v6 engine while imagining myself from the outside in that sexy looking body style i have no idea how much mpg i get heck i dont even know the epa ratingand i dont even care to check i know i am not spending as much at the pump as an escalade or hummer driver and that is as much as i probably care if gas prices get too high really high i probably go and get a honda civic or a corrollai like the hybrid honda v6 too for now i probably will change my g35 coupe only because i get bored easily but i will get another sport coupe and i wouldnt care less about the epa or the mpg i like your attitude shades but i think you have to admit that you are in the minority this discussion while going on too long now is important to many of us maybe not the pissing match between the g35 and bmw spinners but about the reality of the epa numbers and how different types of driving effect your overall mileage im surprsied nobody has mentiond the great mileage the tl gets with a 270 hp engine at least on the highway  over 30 mpg yes i am a tl spinner the lexus canada website has fuel consumption for the 250 manual at 2437 the 250 auto is 2942 the 350 is rated at 2637 mpg great mileage but doesnt it seem odd that a 25 liter with a manual transmission is getting worse mileage than a 35 liter auto one would have to think its a typo the tl is such a great car on so many levels good gas mileage very low emissions great looking inside and out great sound system great accelaration etc my god that cant be right if it is lexus might have found a convert on just that element dont canadians use kilometersmetric system anyone confirm this is correct seriously if its true im astounded the entire world uses the metric system p not true sorry to burst your bubble judging from some of the previous g35 posts my guess would be in heavy stop and go traffic 19 would be an optimistic figure i should have qualified my statement almost all of the world uses the metric system and all of the scientific world uses the metric system p at cruising speed 6585 the car could be geared so the engine spins at low rpms and shuts down two cylinders i can see getting decent gas mileage but if you are using all of those horses racing bmws and attempting to beat anything that moves there is no way gas mileage will be anything short of lousy my next question is does the epa do the testing for canadian vehicles im rather blown away at the idea of 37 mpg in a car sporting 300 hp and no hybrid electrical motors seriously that mileage raises my interest in the is250350 again thats assuming those numbers reflect american gallons and miles still no manual but im even more determined to drive it now you betcha thats why i was wondering what the testing procedure was and if the epa does the testing for our friends north of the border the gas mileage sounds absolutely astounding but my guess is when it gets to the us it will be sporting similiar mileage to the avalon edit  i did some digging and found the following check the advisory on page 28 text noted below caution on using us fuel economy data\\nus web sites list fuel economy data in miles per us\\ngallon and use different sales data based on the us\\nvehicle market fuel efficiency ratings in canada and the\\nus are similar but cannot be directly compared httpoeenrcangccatransportationtoolsfuelconsumptionguidepdffuelconsumptiongu   ide2005pdf page 33 lists the 330i manual as 2439 that says it all canada uses imperial gallons which is 20 more than the us gallon most people i know whether 3 series tl gs g35 accord v6 get less than epa especially in the city maybe my friends and relatives are just hard drivers from lexusca for the is350 fuel consumption  cityhighway l100km 10877\\nfuel consumption  cityhighway mpg 2637 i believe the l100km figures translate to about 22 american mpg city 305 highway feel free to correct me if im wrong i like the 2006 mb cclass lineup no more fourbangers a nice array of v6 engine choices c230 25 v6 201 hp 29975\\nc280 30 v6 228 hp 33725\\nc350 35 v6 268 hp 38325 i bet mb changes the designation to c250 c300 and c350 with the next cclass also i wouldnt mind seeing the 228 hp 30 v6 make its way into the e class e300 to go up against the 525i canada used to use the imperial gallon but went metric in the 70s the ratio is 5 imperial to 6 us because the fluid ounces are slightly different  us gallon is 4 x 32 fl oz quarts  imperial is 4 x 40 different fl oz quarts all moot because outside of liberia  the us gasoline is sold by the litre  fuel mileage is usually expressed in litres100 km however converting isnt exactly rocket science imperial gallons sounds so royal id rather my car got imperial mpg than us mpg p but you make a good point in explaining the difference what do you think about the latest comparo the 3 is still on top despite the horsepower advantage of the is the lexus fanatics are fuming about this and proclaiming bmw is dead hp aint everything and the rags are biased the bmw fanatics dont seem to notice in additition it seems to be noted the back seat of the is 350 is a little cramped well see if lexus takes the kind of heat bmw did for having a cramped backseat in its e46 lineup does the rumored bmw 35l twinturbo future engine change anything the tl back seats are great p additionally all these cars are fantastics even the bmws lol p comparos are fun and informative there is only one way to determine the best car buy it ok i hope the roving host is indulgent with me  since im new  and getting the hang of this i posted this on over on the mercedes boards because thats where i started in research  but after scanning for a while found all the other boards  and this one is where i should have posted anyway looking back this board has a good balanced sense for these type of questions right now i drive a 2004 volvo s60 t5 im trying to decide whether i want to purchase one of the new mercedesbenz cclass vehicles to replace it the new enginetransmission combo for the 2006 cclass line is making me give it serious consideration im trying to find out if theres enough benefit to make the move id welcome all opinions the tough part is that the volvo s60 t5 is perfectly fine for some quick comparisons the first number is the volvo figure the second is the 2006 mb c280 cylinders 5 vs 6\\nhp 208 vs 228 25l vs 30l\\ntorque 236 ft lbs 1500 rpm vs 221 ft lbs 2700 rpm the volvo is turbocharged i like the volvos ride power and smoothness what i dont like is that the s60 is not quite as compact the turning radius for the s60 is 387 the c280 touts 353  which would be better for me in the area i live the width of the s60 is 714 vs the c280s 680 yet these are minor points  given my car is only 2 years old thoughts opinions other facts tia  the 3 is still on top despite the horsepower advantage of the is the lexus fanatics are fuming about this and proclaiming bmw is dead hp aint everything and the rags are biased the bmw fanatics dont seem to notice really  there are two fallacies in this post 1 that lexus fanatics are fuming and 2 that bmw fanatics dont seem to notice 1 lexus fanatics are not fuming rather we recognize the vast superiority of the is350 over the 330i the numbers speak for themselves or do you want me to post them for ya  the tester bimmer couldnt even make it through the test mechanically breaking down under its own weight 2 and bimmer fans are slowly but surely waking up to the new cd review just wait until it is widely available on newstands i dont think most bmw officianados ever imagined an entry level lexus to do a 51s 060 and a 137s  104mph to the 14mile  an e90 cannot even approach these numbers and that is an auto tranny is350 going against a 6mt 330i just imagine the is with a 6mt  and the difference bw these two cars according to cd  1 pt separating 1st from 2nd  that is a virtual tie maybe bmw needs to be more concerned that teir tester car proved to be unreliable when faced with its peers will be interesting to see how bmw reacts to this new challenge from lexus it should be a lotta fun for consumers eh  if you think new ls is a challenge to bmw let it be so bmw fans dont think so you need to stay in line next to g35 owners bragging about hp and 060 20 year olds buy hp and 060 if you would know how to drive i assume you dont according to your post you would not brag about those numbers what important is driving dynamics look at skidpad and slalom if i would want a boat with lots of hp i would go with charger if anything is can go against mb if you ask me its another bust for lexus i second what pp said hp isnt everything bmw is not dead in spite of certain selfproclaimed prognostications to the contrary as a matter of fact they are just warming up lost the set but will win the match i think lexus needs to be concerned that again they may not have gotten it right yet again in spite of hp numbers bmw has always delivered a one two punch one point from a car that has 40 hp less hp isnt everything i do agree it will be fun for consumers i havent driven either car but your comments i like the volvos ride power and smoothness what i dont like is that the s60 is not quite as compact the turning radius for the s60 is 387 the c280 touts 353  which would be better for me in the area i live make me think you should also consider the volvo s40t its faster than your s60 which you said is fast enough but its size is more similar to the mercedes it might be the perfect combo for you i test drove an s40 and think i wouldve been happy with it but it was too small also while your post doesnt discuss luxury features if youre a luxuryfeature kinda guy the s40 might fall short there too dont know if thisll work but i ran a quick comparison of the s60 s40  c280 on the edmunds website heres the link again once i close out i dont kow if this link will work or not and you might need to copy  paste the link nto your browser but\\nhttpwwwedmundscomappsnvcedmundsvehiclecomparisonjsessioniddjh84ctnwjx6tc

but you have to readd the s40 lets see if this is clickable 2006 volvo s60 25t vs 2006 mercedesbenz cclass c280 okay it works for me  however ymmv no promises here d d sticking your head in the sand here guys but i can understand when people dont like to deal with reality thats what the shrink will tell you the is brings a total package to the table the new is350 is sleek elegantly styled as opposed to the muted bangled e90 better interior ergonomics as opposed to the spartan interior of the e90 better braking bestinclass as tested high quality build typical lexus fit and finish improved chassis tightened and more rigid enormous hptq rating for a naturally aspirated v6 motor 51hp57ibft of tq higher than the e90 excellent mpg for a 300hprated car luxury features out of the wazoo everything u can get in a 65k fullsize lux sedan and priced competitively based on mag reports against the e90 that cd described as platinum visa priced and you have yourself a car to be worried about lexus is not worried they did not get it right just wait until the car hits showrooms before we pronounce hitormiss did you read the cd review yet  here is a quote welcome to the most exuberant lexus ever built i suggest you take the time to digest the review and youll see that the 330i did not win the comparo on objective stats you gotta ask how the 330i won by 1 pt  did you see the numerous mechanical issues that the tester had  i can understand why you dont want to face that fact and instead claim hp is not everything as if the is is only about hp see above like cd said hp is just one thing  lexus has also poured sweat into the steering and suspension on your part gentlemen feel free to discount the new is i am sure bmw execs are not and true entry lux sport sedan buyers are going to seriously want to jump into a lexus sedan that can do the amazing things this is350 can do as tested knowing they are looking at a car that is wellbuilt very fast very safe and very reliable with excellent customer service to boot well this is the whole argument right you keep talking about objective criteria but buying a car is all about subjective criteria car reviewers get this even if you dont not that im taking one side or the other i havent driven the new is yet i liked the old one a lot more than most people regards\\nkyfdx oac you gotta ask yourself how did a slower car that broke down beat out a brand new contender that sprang from the most powerful and financially flush company in the world how could the company behind such sensational tactile insanely great cars as the ls430 camry and rx330 not beat out a slower more expensive most likely less reliable bmw how did the is350 lose a vast automotive conspiracy bias to think the 330i couldnt outrace an is350 to 60 or the 14 mile and it broke down yet some wacky jouranlists still picked it things that make ya go hmmmm the is brings a total package to the table dont look now but the total package is missing a manual transmission assuming youre referring to the is350 as you yourself expressed just imagine the is with a 6mt imagine id rather they actually make one available but thats just me the is300 i drove had more hp  tq than the 325i e46 i bought why did i buy the 3 because hp isnt everything and thats a fact its not even in my top ten when i buy a car that fails to pull itself up the steep incline to my parents house then ill consider it underpowered i like the new is more than most but without a clutch and h pattern shifter available the 350 isnt even a consideration if i were looking at purchasing a new car this fall id be looking seriously at the is250 not the is350 by the way a v6 is a step backwards over the previous i6 there must be a lot of denial going on around here confuse you gotta ask yourself how did a slower car that broke down beat out a brand new contender that sprang from the most powerful and financially flush company in the world a vast automotive conspiracy bias bgdc on the face of it that an unreliable bmw beat out a new is350 smark of conspiracy dont ya think  lets see of the 3 major cateogries  vehicle powertrain and chassis the is350 beat out the 330i in 2 of 3 vehicle and powertrain but lost in the chassis category hmmm  the is350 is a better car where it matters vehicle fitandfinish ergonomics style etc and powertrain performance engine flexibility tranny etc gottahaveitfactor dead tie funtodrive 23to22 a virtual tie so how exactly did this broken down unreliable e90 win  and if you diehard fanatics cannot even see that these two cars are a virtual tie you must have more denial than i think but more to your point we all know how much these auto rags rave about the 3series as the benchmark of bmw automotive engineering excellence to beat that car will take a herculian task and the is350 did even with a slushbox  the measured objective and subjective difference bw the e90 and the is350 is infinitesimal at best virtual tie at worst that it took lexus 6 years to beat the vaunted 3series is what counts not the unreliability of the bimmer or the money flush at toylexus at least they put their money where their mouth is dont look now but the total package is missing a manual transmission assuming youre referring to the is350 as you yourself expressed just imagine the is with a 6mt imagine id rather they actually make one available but thats just me for how many people in the na market  even bmw sells far more slushboxes than stick shifts so  the is300 i drove had more hp  tq than the 325i e46 i bought why did i buy the 3 because hp isnt everything and thats a fact then what is  oh i forget the name and the hype  the ultimate driving machine always trumps reality i like the new is more than most but without a clutch and h pattern shifter available the 350 isnt even a consideration if i were looking at purchasing a new car this fall id be looking seriously at the is250 not the is350 and youll be missing out on the overall best car for ya money in the category your loss is someone elses gain there wont be enough is350s for the demand you can bet that by the way a v6 is a step backwards over the previous i6 the same ol song from bmw officianados the v6 in the is is smoother more efficient provides better mpg than an i6 can ever be and it is technologically superior to an i6 there  and youll be missing out on the overall best car for ya money in the category your loss is someone elses gain there wont be enough is350s for the demand you can bet that well i can understand your feelings of frustration having an automaker with 11b in cash not being able to beat bmw at their own game this thread is the redux of the highend luxury marquees wheres merc1 when we need him in addition with katrina and current bump in fuel prices this might not be the best time to introduce a thirsty car hubris about the gas mileage aside if people drive these cars as intended they will probably be getting less than stellar gas mileage my guess is oil will top 80barrel shortly ouch could rain on lexus parade well i can understand your feelings of frustration having an automaker with 11b in cash not being able to beat bmw at their own game frustration what frustration  ttc all im doing is pointing out reality from hypeu all gotta remove the blinders and face the truth your vaunted 3er aint all that no more  there is a new kid on the block now and it is the is350 this thread is the redux of the highend luxury marquees wheres merc1 when we need him you need merc1 to defend ya  my guess is oil will top 80barrel shortly ouch could rain on lexus parade really  with lexus bringing out more fuelefficient cars in the next couple of years how can that hurt them  the prius is a best seller the highlanderh rx400h are all selling quite well the gs450h will be here in 6 months and soon the camryh what does bmw have to offer the buyers in fuelefficient cars  diesel  ya right  the redux of the high end luxury marques discussion it is a discussion specifically about the vehicles listed above it is not a general conversation about the manufacturers and it is not about each other please keep your comments confined to the subject vehicles thanks what the hell id rather a disel to a gaselectric hybrid no contest diesels run forever and get outstanding gas mileage on the freeway while still supplying great torque batteries engine shutdown i know from experience with turbo diesels that i can pound them and still get great mileage from what ive heard even nanny drivers that do 7080 on the freeway dont come close to 50 mpg with a prius the performance hybrids weigh more and get basically a little bit better mileage than gas versions oh and oac youre basically saying theres a vast automotive conspiracy directing the 330i to beat the is350 in subjective tests when buying my g a couple of years ago i remember the dealership plastered with an article titled the bmw beater when you told them you were also considering other options namely the 3 series they threw the book at you literally well the magazine reprint anyway i bought the g but even though the magazine touted the g as being a bmw beater they confessed that the only reason the bmw lost was because it was priced higher than a comparably equipped g the g has been selling for some time now and guess what bmw has survived no wait thrived i equate the upcoming lexus with the introduction of the g im not one who pulls out a magazine and points to numbers when justifying my decision but kdshapiro makes a good point toyota with all of their resources were despite their best effort and a truck load of hp unable to bump bmw off its seat at the top and some of you are not giving those of us in our early 20s enough credit i choose the 3 over all the other models because i like a car that can hold its own as a complete package hp is not the deciding factor for me and im sure its not the only consideration for many future bmw buyers but before everyone erupts in an argument over which sedan is superior let the gosh darn thing arrive on us soil for sale before throwing punches i bet bmw comes out on top in the end its quite a feat to unseat the old master especially when he re invents himself with the help of one of the best automobile companies around i agree just wait until the car gets here first instead of second guessing whos better this discussion could go on forever peoples opinions will differ and tahts it hard to change someones mind once its set on something just wait til the is gets here then well continue our convo _ its about the cars listed at the top and yeah theres an echo in here and it aint of the toyota variety ah but entry level sport sedans in this world market with diesels are plentiful were not really talking out of turn as bmw mb and the is are all available with diesel engines sorry pat im picking up my new tl tomorrow i ruled out rwd cars because i dont want to put on snow tires every year and id need to here in upstate ny i chose the tl over the g35 awd and is250 awd because of overall value better mileage than the g and more power than the is thanks to everyone here for helping with my decision tim congrats tim if you have the nonnav tl with bridgestone turanza el42 tires be very careful in the snow my first winter with mine here in boston left me wholly unimpressed with the snow performace of these tires take it slow other than the tires cool car does everything well imho best looking of the bunch too regarding the comparos everyone who is simply declaring a victor by the numbers dont forget that the judges all drove the cars and made their decisions does a 060 of 56 vs 58 or 84 vs 87 gs on the skidpad really matter in the real world to you read all you want but drive the cars and make your decisions and voice opinions dont just regurgitate s from the autorags and cr btw long time c and d subscriber love the mag and respect most of their opinions is the is better than the 3 is the g better than the tl is the tl better than all of em yes to each if youve done the research driven the cars and evaluated them versus your criteria thats how i ended up with the tl but keep discussing im sure you will convert everyone to your way of thinking sooner or later yet many car manufacturers brag about hp dont they  weve heard for the umpteenth time how many people claim the is250 awd is underpowered because of its 204hp rating relative to the weight of the car maybe bmw erred in upping the hp going from the e46 to the e90 eh  big mistake who needs more hp in these bmws since it appears many of you dont really care for higher hp in your bmw oh i get it since the e90 has lower hp ratings than the top dogs in the class tl g is then hp doesnt count right on bro many car manufacturers do indeed brag about hp and safety and mpg and interior space and value and build quality and reliability and whatever they believe will move iron drivecompare the cars drivecompare the cars i have driven all these cars except the new is which i plan to as soon as it hits the dealer showrooms loved the feel of the 330ci i drove very recently would buy the car except for the quirks reliability issues mainly the is350 promises to be a great carso i am looking forward to deciding if it is the car for me well see it doesnt count for some it does count for others lexus was never about hp and now it is since it temporarily has the most hp it should automatically be rated 1 confuse as far as bmw goes they dont have to build the most hp to get the most performance and the best handling bmw was never about hp a lot of cars have much more but dont do quite as much imho the e46 325i was worthless not nearly enough power for 3035k car same holds true for an is250 if only want 200 hp ill go buy an a3gti and get a smoother more efficient torquier and in my view better engine than the 30 in my e46 loved the feel of the 330ci i drove very recently would buy the car except for the quirks reliability issues mainly what quirks and reliability issues surfaced in your test drive none in a test drive i drove my friends 2001 330ci but it is not comforting to see that a brand spanking new e90 330i tester provided by bmw to cd broke down with several mechanical failures during the cd review what guarantees are there  see what i mean   and i imagine that since the miata mx5 has less than 200hp it would not qualify as a driving machine less hp than the competitors but one of the finest examples of a balanced machine where all the parts work in symphonic harmony true with the bmw as well imo many posters here appear to know the price of these cars but the value of few the engineering inside of true driving machines allows balance to shine as a primary quality in addition to cornering gs and hp the thought that a 200hp 20 turbo fourbanger in the audivw even compares with the acclaimed 225hp 30l six in the bmw is an interesting take smoother more efficient better lmao most advanced engines produced today are admirable but i dont see the audivw on the wards list as i do the 30 from bmw btw many of the arguments made in this forum for this car or that car would consider ranking a camaro ahead of anything simply due to pricehp ratios kinda like comparing the corvette to the 911 both excellent sports cars but are built to different standards than just hp sit in em and driveem more than empirical numbers will shine through and youll feel the difference true in many products from watches to suits there are buyers for all of these cars that have differing reasons for their choices some financial some just want the fastest for the least and some want the finest that todays automotive engineers can produce regardless of the price  and none are necessarily wrong some buyers just like having the choice of a rolex submariner or a seiko dive watch  its what makes choice a wonderful thing will have to read the article and get back to you  and i imagine that since the miata mx5 has less than 200hp it would not qualify as a driving machine less hp than the competitors but one of the finest examples of a balanced machine where all the parts work in symphonic harmony true with the bmw as well imo no that car is under 30k under 30k and under 2600 lbs means that little 160 hp engine is aokay with me ive made myself clear on this over and overover 30k the car better have more than 200 hp many posters here appear to know the price of these cars but the value of few the engineering inside of true driving machines allows balance to shine as a primary quality in addition to cornering gs and hp the thought that a 200hp 20 turbo fourbanger in the audivw even compares with the acclaimed 225hp 30l six in the bmw is an interesting take smoother more efficient better lmao i find the 20 to be far smoother than my 235hp 330i performance package i find the power delivery to be smooth and linear  unlike the hiccuping stuttering peaky style employed on the 30 the 20 is extremely efficient as it gets 2532 v 2030 on my 30 sorry ive owned a 18t and now own a 30 im more impressed by the old 18t and the current 20 as for trannies the dsgs got it all over bmws notchy balky slow binding 6 speeds most advanced engines produced today are admirable but i dont see the audivw on the wards list as i do the 30 from bmw wards list  pr crap its as worthless as a magazine comparo they put the vq on there too and ever since nissan bumped displacement from 30 to 35 that engines been a nvh nightmare at least in my experience with that rough ratchety engine btw many of the arguments made in this forum for this car or that car would consider ranking a camaro ahead of anything simply due to pricehp ratios this is so patently false its not even funny maybe you forgot this forum has a list of cars that are in the same class not some far out of space thingy please make better argument and leave out the spurious onescomparing the speeds of an is to a 3er is quite correct afterall they are in the same class thanks got the nav in part for the michelin tires that i read about on these forums hopefully theyll be ok in the snow once again you missed the point if you like to go with hp get yourself a charger and save some money but if you enjoy driving experiance you cant get it in is you also missed some important numbers like slalom and lane change handling makes bmw an ultimate driving machine nice leather makes a lexus you know a lexus you can have a good argument with mb owners but bmw is in the different world i bet fwd tl handles better then is p boat is a boat even if its small and rwd with lexus badge on it could not resist not making a comment here dima you are right here  boat is a boat very comfortable boat i must say and for those who like comfort  that is the perfect choice i tried it i liked it comfort side of it but i am still part of those who prefer superior handling of bmw over any comfort of cars like lexus its a very nice boat you right for that reason its better comparable with c320 lexus always targeted mb not bmw when bm finally decided to up hp lexus followed right alone let them catch mb in luxure game and then maybe theyll concentrate on performance not hp and 060 which 3 did you get 325 or 330 6mt or at 325i at nonsp minimum options power and heated seats only at the time i was buying the car i did not even consider anything else  i went straight to the bmw i knew what i wanted and that was it even despite the fact that i knew there is a competition and i could get more car for potentially less money if i go with a different brand but like i said i knew what i wanted after that i had a chance to drive lexus infinity g35 so far no regrets that i went with bmw but it is only my subjective opinion and describes my personal taste just wanted to point out that if you have 208 hp in your volvo you do not have a t5 i notice that none of the bmw officianados posting here have provided a single stat to back their statement about how the bimmer is better than the is rather its the same ol same ol you trut out about how bmw is such a great handling car blah blah blah ill say it again the new is350 is a 3er beater it comes with everything youd need to kick the 330i even when mated to a slush box it still outruns all the mt sedans in its class but its not just about speed is it  its braking is bestinclass its interior ergonomics is better than the e90 its exterior style is equally better its handling is about even and its ride is a tad lower than the e90 wnonsport version is350 v sporttuned 330i in the funtodrive category it is a virtual tie with the e90 and in the gottahaveit both cars are a dead tie how hard are these stats to digest for yall  oh it promises to be more reliable more safe and we already know it is the fastest naturally aspirated v6 car in the entrylux sport sedan class a 51s to 60 is unbelievable and doing a 137s to 14mile has to be even more outstanding but who cares eh  oh the is350 is 5248 while the e90 is 507493 these two are the most balanced in the entire class in 1990 mb execs and fanatics looked down their nose at lexus 15 years later they are looking up their nose at lexus now its bmws turn to face toylexus and if you guys dont learn anything from history guess what you are bound to repeat it like i said bmw execs are certainly not taking lexus lightly but itll take you guys a while to come to that reality so continue your headinthesand folly ill say it again the new is350 is a 3er beater it comes with everything youd need to kick the 330i except the road feel the is isnt out yet and cd like the 330i better finesse over hp i think that says it all i find the proclamations about bmw being dead amusing when a competitors car that has more hp but not a better drivers car looses to the incumbent if hp alone is your game you will never win because someone will always have more hp if bmw ever looked down their nose at lexus they must be celebrating with champagne at this latest comparo even though the car had some issues it still came out on top now where is the 35l twinturbo note i too find 51 unbelievable but i wonder how many times that can be done without the tranny falling out lemon it still is remarkable though not unexpected 060 times have been inching down for the last few years with gas prices inching up to 400 gallon its going to be interesting how many people actually buy the is350 when its available ok oac if i agree with you that is350 is a 3er beater will it make you feel better if it is and if it helps you to sleep better  ok is350 is 3er beater i just dont recall since when it even became an issue what car beats what car it is wise to discuss proc and cons and exchange opinions on different cars in order to make and an educated decision when choosing your next car but argue and yell with no apparent reason my car beats yours reminds my yearly school years\\nbut again  if it makes you feel better then ok let it be so you car beats mine 325i by the way have you driven is350 and have you driven is350 and 325330 bmw backtoback lately id really wish to hear your objective opinion you are right though in one thing  none of the bmw aficionados posting here have provided a single stat to back their statement about how the bimmer is better than the is well maybe because it is useless to defend something that you simply love and enjoy driving i dont see any point in it but to answer your statement about bmw handling same ol same ol  how bmw is such a great handling car blah blah blah i guess i just remembered how i measured the handling once i was driving my friends lexus nice comfortable car and turned steering wheel slightly and anticipated actually needed that the car will start turning i turned the steering wheel a good id say 10 maybe 13 degrees well needless to say the car kept going straight at the same speed and turning bmws steering wheel the same number of degrees bmw actually responds that is why i personally prefer bmw because of its handling and other things\\nbut in no way i am saying that my car is better or god forbids beats yours i am just saying that i like my car for characteristics that have values to me and you probably like your car for some other characteristics that have values to you we just have different values\\nlighten up dude i give up u guys just cant post straight i conclude that you cant handle reality even when presented as clearly as one can braking ride handling speed fitandfinish ergonomics etc were all tested and the is350 and 330i are a virtual tie yet i get statements like this i find the proclamations about bmw being dead amusing when a competitors car that has more hp but not a better drivers car looses to the incumbent sad really i notice that none of the bmw officianados posting here have provided a single stat to back their statement about how the bimmer is better than the is rather its the same ol same ol you trut out about how bmw is such a great handling car blah blah blah can you tell me with stats why veal cordon bleu tastes better than a mcdonalds hamburger in 1990 mb execs and fanatics looked down their nose at lexus 15 years later they are looking up their nose at lexus now its bmws turn to face toylexus and if you guys dont learn anything from history guess what you are bound to repeat it like i said bmw execs are certainly not taking lexus lightly but itll take you guys a while to come to that reality so continue your headinthesand folly in 1990 the ls400 undercut the price of the nearest bmwmbs by over 10k they got in on price and ability the ls400 was more reliable and almost as nice as the bmwmb counterparts but it had a massive ace up its sleevethe price was so scary low 35k that people had to look this is the tactic infiniti took with the g35 offer 90 95 of the 3 series but at 57k lower its worked and the g35 has carved out a niche will lexus do this with the is250350 indications are the is250 will start at 30k stripped no leather no xenons no moonroof is350 would probably be 3436k well know soon as far as i can tell to get xenon lights on the is350 you must get the 3rd highest package and a moonroof is still an option we know the cars will come with this stuff on lots so its safe to say an is350s gonna run over 38k msrp im betting given gs pricing differences between the 6 and 8 that the is350 will start at 3637k just like the 330i so im not expecting the is350 to be less than a 330i wheres the value the value proposition is what got lexus where it is never forget that just like hyundai lexus came up offering almost as much as the competition but for less money maybe some of us have different meaures of what makes a car worthwhile to us your metrics are different than my metrics my metrics are different than cds metrics stats does not tell the whole story and never has sad that a giant conclusion has been drawn from one comparo and a car one cant even buy my 330is been in the shop for about a week and in that time ive driven a rentals and borrowed my broinlaws 325i last night after 5 days in a sebring my bros 325i felt so dialed in i wasnt a fan of his car until last night kd you and i exchanged posts on the is board and you prefered we bring it over here now that its here you complain about it stats does not tell the whole story and never has i agree however you initiated this discussion about the cd comparo saying that lexus fans are fuming and bmw fans dont seem to notice or care so i tried to capture the essence of the comparo and argue that the new is350 at least according to the comparo you pointed out showed a vitural tie between both cars thats it but after debunking your assertions you turn to the other kicker  stats dont tell the whole story if you cannot argue facts why initiate a debate on one eh  i am done thats an interesting comment about mb executives in the early lexus days i was staying in a hotel in germany in 1993 at which a meeting of mb executives was taking place i was driving an ls400 at the time  a wonderful car i mentioned this to one of the mb executives i chatted briefly with in the lobby his attitude was one of polite disdain at even considering lexus as competition now we see mb following the cheap to execute horsepower race strategy while lexus pulls ahead with the new paradigm of hybrid synergy drives ill say i miss my car so much that just about anything with a manual and no dive in corners feels like heaven finally a rest from oac and i was just getting fired up surprise  does anyone know where i can get info on the bimmer turbo thats supposed to come out oac i have no idea what your talking about let me recap the things i have generally said across both boards 1 i find the lexus 350 appealing\\n2 with gas prices estimated to be going to 4gallon toyota has picked a lousy time introduce what is probably a gas sucking sports sedan unless you dont drive as intended this thing will suck gas you cannot have blazing acceleration and blazing gas mileage simultaneously\\n3 there seems to concerns with the bias of the cd toward bmw seemingly having a lesser car take the 1 spot\\n4 there is no doubt the engine is bigger on the is but that doesnt make it a better sports sedan\\n5 bmw is not dead\\n6 its going to take a fair number of reviews to see where the is350 fits in the pecking order when the g35 it was the king was dead not even close for bmw it beat bmw in every metric as more comparos were done different results began to emerge\\n7 the 51 to 60 is impressive no doubt i wouldnt want to try that with my car though\\n8 the hp and gas sucking wars are not over bmw is rumored to be working on a 35l twin turbo engine so if im complaining what are you doing  good point its a 25t having a designation of 25t and t5 on the same model s60  makes it easy to make typos volvo really wants to confuse people no doubt and seeing as how nobody caught it in the couple of pages of posts that followed i think that proves your point well that and the fact that volvo falls under the radar of most sporty sedan buyers unfortunately imho 35k sports sedans bmw 330i finishes 1st with 213 points edging out the is350 with 212 points 3rd place with 203 points infiniti g35 then acura tl audi a4 cadillac cts volvo s60r and saab 92 the is350 smoked the others in acceleration 060 in 51 next best being the tl and g35 at 59 sec i found the details on cl forgive me if this info has already been posted here i dont frequent this forum as for trannies the dsgs got it all over bmws notchy balky slow binding 6 speeds hey blueguy im a happy tsx owner who loves running through the gears of my six speed its one of my favorite aspects of driving this car that and the sharp handling im also nurturing a serious e90 jones i challenge anyone here to read all of yours and shipos posts on this and the 3 series board and not develop one p  and see it as my next car my question is about the bmw tranny are they really that bad itd be hard to go from a great tranny like the tsxs to one thats not so great thanks states that while they really like the car overall it falls short of its intention to compete with the 3 series bimmers mostly because of its rather disconnected feel from the road and lack of steering feedback they also mentioned that the engine  while powerful is so quiet its hard to hear except under hard acceleration they also state that they felt the car had lost some of the edge of the is300 basically they are saying its less of a drivers car than it needs to be to compete with the 3 series on those terms this all comes on the heels of a rather solid review of the e90 they had their nits to pick with it as well but said its chassis makes up for a lot sounds like its a very sharphandling car cant wait to drive one personally i think the is350 is a sharplooking car with a squat muscular stance but i cant understand why lexus wouldnt offer a mt in a car they expect to compete with a drivers car like the e90 just my 02 worth johnny i still have fantasies about owning hondas silky 6 speed the tsx tranny made me so happy ok how about a lotus elise well over 30k and under 200hp my point was to drive home one of the many reasons people love to drive bmws balance  me included i drive a 2003 530sp and find the straight6 one of the finest engines ive had the pleasure to drive  and ive owneddriven everything from the subie wrx sti to 911s hiccuping and stuttering are not qualities ive observed in my car and doubt if any other bmw owners with the 30l will concur unless they are using 87octane fuel glad you are personally more impressed with your 18t and 20 audivw powerplants your comments regarding wards are interesting given the holy wars that have erupted around here based upon magazine comparos dont think id dismiss wards as easily as you have  what is your opinion based upon lousy engineering expertise marketing dollars in reviewers pockets you can take anything in print with a grain of salt important thing is to see for yourself as each persons objectivity is distinct i enjoy reading opinions but that does not shape my own until i have seatofthepants evidence to form my own opinions based upon my personal value system in this review the is350 got a 060 time of 60s no theyre not that bad the 5speeds in my e36 318ti and e46 325i are notchy between 1st and 2nd but it doesnt interfere with shifting in the least ive been driving bmw manuals for 10 years now and feel theyre better than most its as good as most any in this category confess i didnt test the tl the 6speed in the mb c230 i tested last year was the best in this category by using the word slow i think blueguy is comparing all manuals to a dsg a dsg is faster can be smoother wouldnt be balky or notchy but personally id take the worst manual in this category over the best dsg but thats a personal preference of course out of category a smattering of reviews ive read said the shifter in the miata is the smoothest but i didnt feel compelled to verify it elise is a fun car but not an everyday driver hiccuping and stuttering are not qualities ive observed in my car and doubt if any other bmw owners with the 30l will concur unless they are using 87octane fuel to each his own i use 91 in my 330i performance package ever since they replaced my blown ignition coils known issue bmw blames on the supplier instead of admitting fault my engines run like a trash compactor you can take anything in print with a grain of salt important thing is to see for yourself as each persons objectivity is distinct i enjoy reading opinions but that does not shape my own until i have seatofthepants evidence to form my own opinions based upon my personal value system same here i dont trust cr magazines edmunds wards or anyone elses views awards comparos or statements i must experience the car for myself i still think audis 20t is a better engineered engine than the 30 in my bmw by using the word slow i think blueguy is comparing all manuals to a dsg nope a bmw tranny cannot keep up with a lightning fast shift  as in bam clutch down out of gear 2 into gear 3 gas clutch out the tranny binds and or it simply wont go into third i can replicate this on my broinlaws 325i too the tranny simply cant keep up with the kind of speed shifts im used to getting from mazdahonda trannies love the dsg but still like the tactile feel of a clutch out of category a smattering of reviews ive read said the shifter in the miata is the smoothest but i didnt feel compelled to verify it love miata manuals the tranny simply cant keep up with the kind of speed shifts im used to getting from mazdahonda trannies hmmm i go through all the gears as fast as my right arm and left leg will allow pretty sure i wasnt shifting the any of the others any quicker my procedure is a clutch pedal down gas pedal up and moving out of gear all at the same time\\nb when my clutch foot hits bottom it comes right up and id better be in the next gear or therell be heck to pay as the left foot is coming up the right one is going down the mb felt better but i doubt if i was shifting it any faster as far as bulky and notchy that describes the 6speed in the r32 to a tee love miata manuals noted ill have to get off my derriere one of these days and try one  things are getting personal and thats not what we are here for we need to keep our comments confined to the vehicles we are not here to talk about each other and certainly not here to make personal criticisms thanks guess one reason the new bmw m5 has the smg is that a suitably slick 6sp manual is not ready although i hear one is coming will be interesting to see what bmw delivers to mate with the new v10 if its good it should trickle down to the 5 and 3series maybe the new 550 6sp is better someone posted that they drove the 550 6sp in germany and that it was fast wonder what shiftfeel was like in this new car i personally enjoy the 5sp in the 3series but love the miata tranny honda s2000 is also sweet problem is that the miata and s2000 are designed for hobbits and im a svelte 64 no more personal comments please if you cant keep your message about the vehicles in this discussion you need to not post at all if you believe that someone has posted something inappropriately email me and let me review the situation there are no circumstances that make attacking another member appropriate none at all  see the membership agreement or email me if you have any questions did you notice the asterisk regarding bmws brake test the freaking brakes failed and the car spun out so they used figures from a previous years test give the bmw a zero for its brakes like it deserved and it doesnt even come in second no wonder mercedes didnt supply a c350 for the comparo they knew it was fixed the general consensus is that the 330i set a new standard while some may not like the car in general it has garnered high praise while i think bmw probably should have made sure it supplied a car without defects this is not the first time a car german or japanese has failed in a comparo and it wont be the last given what the car manufacturers know about how these tests are conducted they probably circulate a beater although at times the mags comment how they get a brand new car so in order to have a comparo cd did a reasonable thing these comparos are to be taken with a grain of salt anyway althouth they are good to use as a data point in a discussion such as this i have no problems with my e46 5mt either i had a chance to drive both tl and tsx 6mt honda manuals do feel much softer and easier to shift you know i did experiance the same thing in my car from 2nd to 3rd i thought i did not push the clutch all the way down maybe it is trany i was not be able to replicate this though so in order to have a comparo cd did a reasonable thing these comparos are to be taken with a grain of salt anyway althouth they are good to use as a data point in a discussion such as this with a grain of salt indeed  here are the actual scores for the 330i in the vehicle category 873437979017 74 but cd gave it 75 to yield the 1pt margin of victory for the bimmer fuzzy math indeed  meaning overall the is350 and 330i had the exact same final score  212 pts a tie for 1st overall id say the test was rigged cos a broken down car should score zero and using previous yrs number shows how much they wanted the bimmer to win so much for objectivity  for those happy that i have left dream on taking nothing away from the 3er it simply is not the ultimate driving machine that is all hype  for those who wont give the is350 a test you will be missing a great car ill surely wave bye to you as you watch my tail disappear in traffic in my is350 for those happy that i have left dream on taking nothing away from the 3er it simply is not the ultimate driving machine that is all hype  it may be hype and it may be rigged but as others have noted before horsepower is not the endall and beall thats the hype you allude to just ask infiniti im sure bmw execs broke open the champagne when they read this review lexus gave the is350 its best shot but it wasnt good enough if your goal is stop light racing and triple digits on the speedometer ill wave as you pass in order to have a reasonable comparo i gave the kid who couldnt read a b so he could graduate he just put the wrong part on your car and your point is what magazines are different or the same as college educations thanks for the input on bmw trannies i guess from now on my point of reference for transmissions will always be the tsxs 6mt p now i just have to drive the e90 im very curious to compare its driving dynamics with the tsx ill drive both the 325i and the 330i johnny while i dig the tsx its the tranny reliability and value i like the e90 is far imho beyond the last gen 3 e46 for handling that all the competition is in major catchup mode now sublime is the only way to describe the way the new car feels with a sport package and a manual for those who wont give the is350 a test you will be missing a great car as far as im concerned it cant qualify as a great car unless theres a working clutch pedal next to the brake pedal an is250 with a 6speed might just might qualify in my book if it aint got a stick youre just a passenger no matter where youre sitting ill surely wave bye to you as you watch my tail disappear in traffic in my is350 and ill be sure to wave back as i pass the gas station yeah i find this intriguing cause the tsx is the best handling car ive owned i can rail corners in that car even with the stock allseason tires nice quick steering rack handles midcorner bumps well it does push pretty hard at the limit the idea that a car like the e90 can be that much better gets me pretty hyped to try it ive been a big fan of bmw for a long time but ive never driven one or in one like i said ive been nursing a bimmer jones somethin fierce shades johnny as far as im concerned it cant qualify as a great car unless theres a working clutch pedal next to the brake pedal an is250 with a 6speed might just might qualify in my book if it aint got a stick youre just a passenger no matter where youre sitting agreed im not sure the is350 is a direct competitor to the 3 series without the manual johnny i was that way for a long time once i got into the seat of a 330i with a manual i finally got it i had to buy one after that if it aint got a stick youre just a passenger no matter where youre sitting thank goodness now i dont really have to pay attention to the road when im driving i can concentrate more on my crossword coffe email etc cuz im not really a driver phew or any of the race series drivers that use the paddle shifters do they know theyre just along for the ride those cars have dsgs not autos although im sure you already knew that there no power sapping torque converter to me the dsgsmgssg or what have you is the best compromise between auto and manual race series drivers using paddle shifters are controlling gearing with clutches people driving slushbox automatics are not doing anything remotely similar theres a big big difference between a sequential manual or direct shift gearbox and a torque converter equipped videogamey tiptronicsportmaticsteptronic ive been driving an automatic car for a week now im bored to death theres barely any engine control  even with dorky shift buttons or paddles my interest in my drive time has gone from paying total attention to passively sitting in long lines even when the lane beside me is moving why bother pulling out ill have to endure the excrutiatingly slow shifts and harsh downshifting one gets from automatics honestly my drive with an automatic has turned me into another listless worker bee either heading to the hive or away from it the only time this week that i felt in control and alive  i had my broinlaws 325i manual for about 2 hours heaven geez i didnt realise that 60 of all bmw drivers with slushboxes arent really driving their wonderful machines eh  even owners of 745750760 the m5 ultrasuperduper performance machine and tons of amgs out there with slush boxes must be drinking coffee and putting on makeups while in these cars by your logic these people are simply poseurs and not drivers see how ridiculous that is  i drove plenty of cars with sticks in my lifetime but i am not enamored by it its simply a much more involved way of driving thats about it but if you live in your car maybe its important here in socal with the constant stopandgo traffic having an auto tranny is convenient you can look down your nose at those with slush boxes while your small band of stickloving drivers continues to dwindle by the second before long their would not be a single true manual to be found in any car then whatll you all do  ride a bike to work  hehehehehe actually a lessthanskilled driver with an automatic will usually blow the doors off a lessthanskilled driver with stick not only do you have to coordinate rapid shifts but you have to know the torque and horsepower peaks of the engine to nail the optimal shift points given two comparable cars i would bet that more often than not the guy with the automatic will beat the guy with the stick and i146ve seen it happen quite often well the is350 has set the new standard in this class in terms of acceleration i dont think there is any doubt about that how about other aspects of what makes a car handling definitely not gas efficiency definitely not ride no room definitely not features depends a fully loaded one is tops in this class in features imo a base is350 has less features than a base g35 interior quality not yet known but i bet its up there with the a4 in this department price gonna be up there with a 3 series here in socal with the constant stopandgo traffic having an auto tranny is convenient to me its boring and i live in so cal you can look down your nose at those with slush boxes while your small band of stickloving drivers continues to dwindle by the second before long their would not be a single true manual to be found in any car then whatll you all do  ride a bike to work  hehehehehe get a dsg and still be involed in the driving of the car in some fashion without a torque converter robbing power or a cpu overriding my gear changes and transmissions  along with the intelligence that guides the automatics  are getting better each day the new c280c350 that mercedes is putting out and maybe the slk equivalents have a 7speed automatic that has been reviewed as smooth enough to both adjust to the individual drivers habit and make it tough to figure out what gearspeed youre in at any given time havent tried the car but i want to im not really a driver so true or any of the race series drivers that use the paddle shifters do they know theyre just along for the ride race car drivers are in it to win period theyll sacrifice the pleasure of driving to be first across the line if sitting on thumbtacks will make them go a little faster theyll do it  i wont geez i didnt realise that 60 of all bmw drivers with slushboxes arent really driving their wonderful machines eh  as far as im concerned that is correct by your logic these people are simply poseurs and not drivers see how ridiculous that is  never said or implied that theyre poseurs i said theyre passengers theyre wonderful people who have made the choice that they want to get from point a to point b in as much comfort and convenience andor as fast as their budget will allow thats their choice i never denigrated anyone for choosing that route the word poseur was introduced to this thread by you not me i have nothing against passengers ive been known to be one myself on occasion actually there are a few g owners posting here who have accused all 3 owners of being poseurs regardless of what transmission they choose before long their would not be a single true manual to be found in any car the automatic has been around for over fifty years and yet the manual lives on you can look down your nose at those with slush boxes while your small band of stickloving drivers continues to dwindle by the second then whatll you all do  ride a bike to work  hehehehehe you dont have to worry about me if all manufacturers decide theyll be more profitable selling only automatics your local transmission shop will start advertising autotomanual conversion jobs and ill be one their first customers besides youre assuming the situation in the us is echoed all over the planet talk to a european ask himher if the manual transmission is dying not only do you have to coordinate rapid shifts but you have to know the torque and horsepower peaks of the engine to nail the optimal shift points true but with most dohc 4valvescyl engines the optimal shift point is generally easy to figure  its the point where the rev limiter kicks in i cant believe what happened yesterday since i now know that im not a driver just a passenger i decided to read the wall st journal on the way to work rather than pay attention to the road steer brake accelerate or play with my tls autostick well after getting the car going in the right direction weird i was in the drivers seat and it seemed if i didnt use the steering wheel accelerator and gear selector the car wouldnt move i whipped out the wsj and began reading as my tl approached the 90 degree left turn on my street the tl didnt turn it went straight into my neighbors yard as if there was no driver funny though every other morning when im not driving the tl responds to my decisions and inputs using all the controls provided to drive the car im so confused could it be that manual or automatic or semiautomatic or some variation we really are all drivers confuse actually i do understand what you live manual or die guys are talking about im just having some internet fun well i think its fun for the first 15 years of my driving life i was a diehard 5 speed manual guy saab 99 vw scirocco mitsubishi mirage turbo acura integra and then came the fateful day i was promoted into sales and inherited the sales mangers olds at 11000 miles the gas tank ruptured a seam on the top of the tank and for the next 5 years boring but servicable domestic automatic sedans i did however teach the evil wife to drive a stick and bought her a nissan sentra se  r fun fun fun followed by a saab 900s fun very practical my attempt to avoid an suv or minivan as the family began to grow these were mine to play with on the weekend i retired downsized  from the sales game and bought my company dodge intrepid nice car but very loud and not honda build quality but reliable and good looking good in snow i believed i would return to the land of the driver soon once i began my second career it was time for a new car as i was now a commuter evil wife suggested i drive the saab for a month of commuting to ensure i wanted a stick i was sure the commute wouldnt sway me away i was wrong it was just no fun shifting between 123 every 17 seconds rarely getting above 40mph after a week i returned the saab bought a chrysler 300m  i cant believe i bought a first model year domestic chrysler i broke every rule there and had a plan the wifes next car would be a 5 speed saab 95 or maybe a4 avant possibly a bmw 3 wagon i was looking forward to shopping for her and i would continue my tradition of enjoying row your own boat driving on the weekend ah but as is often the folly that is my grand planning the wife said she was done with manuals she commutes too and driving to her is just a necessary evil hence the saab turned into what else a lexus rx 300 as our family grew again shes very happy therefore im very happy will there be a manual tranny again in my future who knows until then i will continue to drive whatever i choose understanding those that rhapsodize about their fabulous fifth to third slingshot passes on i95 or deftly selecting just the right gear for a sweeper on their favorite hometown back roads but i wont label people very funny i to drove a manual for many years i dont care what people label me as i dont want to row my own gears anymore a dsg type vehicle would be fine its the off the clutch on the clutch off the clutch on the clutch for miles and miles in horrendous traffic that changed my mind so today im a passenger in my own cars which by the way is fine with me oi was sure the commute wouldnt sway me away i was wrong it was just no fun shifting between 123 every 17 seconds rarely getting above 40mph why are you shifting that much keep the car in second thats good for 062 understanding those that rhapsodize about their fabulous fifth to third slingshot passes on i95 or deftly selecting just the right gear for a sweeper on their favorite hometown back roads but i wont label people thatd be 6th to 3rd p i dont care what people label me as i dont want to row my own gears anymore oh  a bimmerophile admitting a necessity for slush box blasphemous kd out of here and in your corner and dont come out ever again  laurasdad excellent post im just having some internet fun ouch you got me shifting between 123 every 17 seconds sounds like heaven to me the dsgsmgssg or what have you is the best compromise between auto and manual to me its actually the worst of both worlds its really not anything like operating a manual trans  coordinating the clutch while rowing away on the lever  but its also often not very good as an automatic sometimes shifting too abruptly and doing other strange things at least early smg now i would be interested in trying out audis dsg trans ive seen the cutaways and decription of how it works and it looks like a very efficient replacement for an automatic but i still dont think its a very good compromise with a true manual trans food for thought had the automatic transmission come first would there have been a need to invent a manual transmission one of my customers said that to me when i asked if he would prefer manual or automatic dont get me wrong i love manual transmissions for the sheer fun factor thanks me hangs my head in shame thats why an smg type of vehicle is appealing potemkin mi amigo never change i imagine your tombstone in a hundred years or so of course will be in the shape of a bmw 6 speed stick tranny console shades keep on shiftin when i was your age there was no sixth gear you whippersnapper unless you mated two three on the tree trannys man i am old im 31 i recall 4 speed manuals im 1 i remember my friends dads car having three on the column uh i owned a 3speed how old does that make me extending this offtopic  had a used 53 ford flathead v8 with three on a tree if you shifted slow to moderate speed from 1 to 2 it was ok if you attempted a speed shift 1 to 2 linkage would hang up and it would be stuck in first had to stop the car open the hood reach down and jiggle the linkage free current crop of drivers dont know how good they have it with slick shifting manuals from bmw 3 series hondaacuras that there are people on here even older than me the first time i made a 4wheel vehicle rode a lambretta scooter earlier go down the road was on a fish hatchery on the fort apache indian reservation in az with a three on the tree the previous several vehicles for our faimily had similar transmissions the thing was amazingly gutless 60 chev belair and i still remember trying to get over red mountain pass in co while people on foot not really passed us the transmission wasnt the issue  the six was still only want to drive manuals mostly because they almost never break and when they do theyre cheaper to fix i tried automatics and it wasnt pretty its better than the alternative just finished applying coat 7 of zaino z5 this time see if i can cover up a few parking lot scrapes this may be my first true addiction at least one more coat of z2 before ole man winter comes around being new england that could be next thursday your posts are great laurasdada p i learned to drive in san francisco and with all the very steep hills i had trouble with a mt when it would slide backwards and hit cars behind me once i got the hang of it i really didnt like working the stick and clutch all the time because i am basically lazy so call me a passenger p hmm having learned to drive stick at 10 ive always found automatics to be less than involving i remember my dad  who was always trying to find ways to keep me off the roads he had no idea i was tearing around a friends farm at insane speeds for 6 years  told me i couldnt take my car the one i bought with my own money until i could prove i could start 10 times on a steep hill without the car rolling backward i cracked off 10 starts he griped and walked away btw im entering my 9th day without a manual as a daily driver im driving like an old lady nowtotally disinterested in the journey thanks nick i used to take pride in my ability to take off from stop on a steep hill i used to seek out challenges never slid back in to a car behind me i havent driven a stick since late 01 so i sure id need some practice took the tl on an unprofitabel road trip today 170 miles 75 highway 25 local roads overall averaged 30mpg  56mph for just the highway portion one way i averaged 32mpg 68mph im impressed beautiful day for a drive ugly day to play blackjack i personally have nothing against driving a slushbox ive driven some fun ones and some plush ones and enjoyed them both in their own way i just wouldnt want to own one as my only car so if youre looking for the perfect car  one that costs between 30000 and 35000 is reliable sporty and fun yet luxurious and comfortable in rush hour traffic may i recommend a 2001 mazda miata 5speed and a 2001 lexus ls400 btw i finally got to read the cd comparo and the rt is350 review it sounds like they both agree the is350 is a terrific performance sedan but one that places luxury above driving dynamics  in other words as a drivers car its no threat to the 3series personally i like a car that communicates what the tires are doing ill gladly sacrifice 5 secs in the 14 mile to drive a car that encourages and rewards good driving technique and puts a smile on my face in this segment it would seem bmw is still top dog i have three coats of z2 pro with the zfx flash cure accelerator applied and was thinking about applying a coat or two of z5 also and a few more z2 afterwards how did the z5 do on the marks i have a few very light swirl marks that i wouldnt mind getting rid of confuse handling definitely not\\ngas efficiency definitely not\\nride no\\nroom definitely not wow when did you get your test drive any more details you could pass on why did you not like the ride did you mean too little room in the back or the front\\noh wait maybe you didnt actually drive the car maybe you are just talking out of your  and do not have any actual emphirical data ps read a review of the 3 series a couple of surprising notes\\n an electrical relay sitting in the front windshields rain gutter\\n keyless entry but you have to put the key fob in a slot in order to start the car\\namazing that such engineering relay or silly execution slot could be part of the class leader in intro lux sedans the z5 seems to do a good job on swirlies and light scratches i have a series of scratches going down the rear passenger quarter panel it looks like someone let my car be a bumper for a shopping cart mad  and the 3 coats of z5 have made them fairly invisible unless you are really looking closely no swirl marks that im aware of ill z2 again for the ultimate shine though i even like the way zaino smells what color is your car a tl i presume keyless entry but you have to put the key fob in a slot in order to start the car this is dependent on the options in the car chosen an electrical relay sitting in the front windshields rain gutter  handling definitely not\\ngas efficiency definitely not\\nride no\\nroom definitely not werent some of these comments from the comparo i believe it was stated the rear seat is cramped now that may not matter to some people but nonetheless it was stated but these are all subjective anyway you have to see what you like and dont like hp isnt everything though definitely not everything cd had 3 categories vehicle won by tl engine by is chassis by 330 4 yearold g also bettered is in chassis cd said is lacks the poise of 3 or g with next gen g certainly will have better engine and chassis and probably will handily repass is lexus really didnt raise the bar that much it sounds like im going to order some z5 and see how it does i didnt order any because the car is only a few months old but after getting three coats of z2 on it i can see the marks no one else could probably see them because they havent been as intimate with the finish as i have been in the last few weeks its a jet black bmw thanks they didnt raise the bar at all they made a fast car thats easily defeated by both infiniti and bmw dont expect a new g35 for awhile though the cars only a few years old i wouldnt expect an all new g35 until 2008 or more likely 2009 i got the hang of a mt but didnt really care for it i can still drive a mt and the new mts are much easier to drive now my first car was a pickup truck i started checking the alfa romeo and found out they dont sell them in the us the alfa is very similar to the tl but does anyone know how much they cost i am a statistician laurasdada and i recommend you learn how to card count when playing blackjack only in your head though p i dont think people around the country realize how steep some of the hills in san francisco can be california street going up to the fairmont hotel is extremely steep it scares tourists dont expect a new g35 for awhile though the cars only a few years old i wouldnt expect an all new g35 until 2008 or more likely 2009 well theyre doing a lot of work on gtr which will debut in a few months in tokyo admittedly its engine and chassis are much more expensive than run of the mill g35 but at least some of the work they should be able to carry over so maybe 25 years from now 3 at the most a lot of work on m carries over also cd really panned a4 saying it stood still getting gased by the competition i guess something has to give when youre trying to develop the useless bugatti and almost useless lm and lamborghini itd be interesting if c350 was available my guess is itd finish ahead of or behind tl i perfected my handbrake launch start on some of those hills i ordered the z5 in addition to the z2 as i have an abyss blue tl my first darker color in a while i started with two z5 coats to hide swirlies and light scrapes it seemed to do a good job but wont perform miracles of course then on to z2 for the higher optical properties nice results nick i know how to count cards an ace and ten equals 11 so double down and take a card which my wife actually did at a charity casino night math isnt her strong suit she did get a ten so turned a blackjack into a 21 im a decent basic strategy player but yesterday there were a couple of inexperienced players one guy stuck on a soft 6 a 6 that seemed to turn a profitable table around to the dark side one rather large gentleman in the sixth seat who was enjoying fairly constant alcoholic beverages drove em away by eventually shouting at them youre working for the casino stop takingnot taking cards from the table geez you must be working for the casino i shoulda walked a couple of shoes earlier than i did oh well im still up for the year the nice smooth powerful economical drive of the tl on the way home took some of the sting away not a whole lot but some sick that the line between sportssedan and luxury sedan excitement and ensconcment attitude and aptitude is a line they refuse to cross who asked for electronic steering or vdim sportssedan with automatic only im sorry luxuryperformance sedan with automatic only new slogans making safe cars too safe to drive the passionate pursuit of reticence onboard driving instructor standard the ultimate frustration machine ruler across the knuckles standard on all 2006 models like an 8yearold afraid to jump into the deepend of the swimming pool the is is the ultimate poseurmobile looks runs built sized like a sportssedan but with the soul of brooke shields the base engine is too base and the bigblock will scare away the average lexus customer lexus will sell its 50k a year but has surrendered a real chance at slaying the last dragon that is the bmw 3series i guess the supra was the last time toyota will ever cross the line drfill guys dont laugh but what is z5 z2 etc is that some sort of car polish if it is how safe it is to apply that to a new car bmw dark blue why would you even want to apply anything to a new car paint i am under impression that any chemical applications to new car paint would void a warranty for paint is that right\\nmike check out zainostorecom for answers zaino is a car polish system it is safe and will not void a paint warranty as unless im wrong there is no warranty just for paint confuse\\ngreat stuff especially for darker colors its time to get back to the cars folks those who are interested can continue the zaino conversation at that link the future of the manual transmission will probably be of interest to a number of you and other offtopic subjects such as cardcounting in blackjack need another forum altogether thanks handling definitely not\\ngas efficiency definitely not\\nride no\\nroom definitely not wow when did you get your test drive any more details you could pass on why did you not like the ride did you mean too little room in the back or the front\\noh wait maybe you didnt actually drive the car maybe you are just talking out of your  and do not have any actual emphirical data haha before you get bent all out of shape you do realize that all posts here positive or negative are just speculation specs derivation and reviews derivation in fact we have 4473 posts of speculation i would think that this would be assumed i also made speculative comments that were very favorable to the is350 yet you didnt have any beef about that or copypaste that i guess if its something positive about the is youre fine with it but if its negative god forbid    by the way i stand by my comments zero reviews so far have said that the is350 sets the class standard in handling we know that the is350 has less room than the g35 tl and even the 330i and i will give you a cookie if the is350 has better mileage than the 330i the only thing maybe that i might change my mind about is the ride component handling definitely not\\ngas efficiency definitely not\\nride no\\nroom definitely not dont know how anyone can say definately not without test driving or at least seeing a car sure this forum has a lot of speculation i just find it strange that so many beemer cult members are taking shots at the new is if it is not real competition to the 3 serieswhy even bother to acknowledge such a lowly vehicle\\nin the final analysis the sales numbers will be all that countsand i think the is will be very successful so if your mind is made up here is a review of the 3 series to confirm your admiration for the handling when you get past the handling aspects consider the other traitsoverall quality of the car enjoy httpwwwthetruthaboutcarscomcontent11244693671382797373indexphp sorry for poor choice of words i meant rust perforation warranty 12 years no a wax or polish shouldnt affect the rust perf warranty another reason not to buy rust proofing from the dealer i think c and d has a history of forgiving overlooking build and reliability flaws for cars that they love to drive as its recent 50 year anniversary issue has pointed out the mag basically started as an ode to british sports cars back in the 50s and as history has shown we all know how reliable and well built british cars were but they loved the driving experience and that was the thrust of the relationship c and d noted the imperfections and because of their respect for the marque downplayed it as far as rating the new 3 imho of course what a cool comparo theres a car there for everyone another thought bmw has been building bmws for a long time acura lexus and infiniti have been building bmws for what five years give em a bit more time and who knows the real winner you and me folks are not hype  we all have different priorities and we are all entitled to them everyone here needs to recognize that someone elses priority is just as important to them as your own is to you and neither of you are right nor are you wrong some of you folks need to calm down and stop making this so personal the cars are what they are and we make the choices we make to suit ourselves and not each other we are here to compare the features of the cars in this class  not to beat each other over the head about our preferences and our choices it was a 212212 tie with the is350 i have the october issue in my hands and the bmw outpointed the is350 by 213212 page 112 if it matters regards\\nkyfdx\\nhostprices paid forums acura lexus and infiniti have been building bmws for what five years honda toyota and nissan have been trying to build bmws for a lot longer than that and since the is350 is the fastest naturaly aspirated v6 sedan out there this can be easily defeated by bmw or infiniti  which bmw would this be  its not a v but its called the m3 awd is not class important just more hype from eastcoasters we in the left coast dont give a hoot about awd it may not be a priority on the west coast but for some folks on the east it is the snowy east coast is a huge market that cant be ignored and if one looks around at the cars on the road the number of awd drive cars is huge not a small miniscule percentage ride and handling the bimmer is good in this area but skimps mightily in other areas i agree with that however the reason i like bmws is for what they dont put in a car in terms of luxoitems i dont need lexusbranded luxury nor do i want it i find the cockpit of the 3 series to be very calming and reassuring but the fact that the 330i had a mechanical issue should have automatically been factored into the comparo the fact it had a mechanical issue has no bearing on the way the car was designed to ride and drive and does ride and drive imo this is what they are measuring truthindisclosure they didnt hide it under the rug the reader can form any opinion they want on the mechanical issue and since the is350 is the fastest naturaly aspirated v6 that statement is true for now however slightly ot the bmw 32 liter i6 is the engine to beat in the naturally aspirated class the base m3 which is a few thousand more at 50k than the 350 and 330i will obliterate the cars in this segment so if your mind is made up here is a review of the 3 series to confirm your admiration for the handling when you get past the handling aspects consider the other traitsoverall quality of the car enjoy httpwwwthetruthaboutcarscomcontent11244693671382797373indexphp interesting thought that they gave the 3series 5 out of 5 star in performance ride and handling 4 out of 5 in desirability and 2 out of 5 in deisgn both of which are entirely subjective categories sound like they really liked the 3series except for the styling not sure how this backs up your point as blueguy so humorously pointed out unless you like to look at your reflection in passing buildings one livesdrives in the interior i really think reviewers ought to stick to the task of evaluating a car from a formfunction perspective and leave the stylingdesireability ratings out of the picture i dont need someone else to tell me if a car is beautiful or ugly what is subjective about having an electrical relay in the rain gutter of the front windshield do you know why its there why is there even an issue unless this car was abused or crashed and a part became loose if not its under warranty for 4y50k what is subjective about being charged more for keyless ignition that is really keyless you dont have to buy the car if you dont like the vehicle options what is subjective about the maintenance issues plaguing these expensive cars yes i agree for the hundreds of thousands of bmws out there there will be some problems no car is immune the g35 has certainly had its share as well and lets not even talk about the toyotalexus sludge and tranny issues the bmw also has a bb 4yr50k free maintenance program along with the warranty my point as it has always been is that these cars should be considered from a to z as a total package if reliability is not apparent how can best in class even be on the radar who said reliability is not apparent because a test car had a malfunction thats like throwing the baby out with the bath water wait dont tell me it handles well it handles like its on rails and its selling like hotcakes ive done some heavy cleaning here im not sure that ive gotten every grimy detail but ive given it a good shot lets see if the rest of you can help keep things neat and tidy around here  well try again and i hope and trust that those who want this discussion to remain viable will all pitch in thanks all the talk on this forum seems to be about bmw infiniti lexus and acura why is nobody talking about the mercedes and cadillac are they that far out of this segment quality features cost etc mb and caddy are pretty much not players in this segment in my experience neither car is very nice handles very well or installs much confidence in their quality id take a bimmer infiniti audi acura lexus before id even touch a caddy at 50 off msrp while ive read that the cts offers a decent driving experience the exteriorinterior style and quality of interior materials is so offputting it never occurred to me to seriously shop it against the frontrunners here the entry level mbs have never seemed to be too exciting a driving experience save for amg models and they aint priced entry level anything nor a good value and yes there is a poor perception regarding gm and mb quality ive heard rumored laurasdada  i disagree about the cts i didnt test drive the v model but the driving experience and amenities were excellent loved the interior i havent driven the cts but have checked it out extensively at the auto show i really thought the interior was low rent typical gm i was truly surprised especially given the 40k window sticker the exterior is a basically handsome shape ruined by extra lines and layers mho of course and i believe it is selling well so gm may not be too concerned with mho my dad loved driving his catera when it wasnt in the shop which unfortunately it was a lot he traded up to an 04 tl hes much happier i found the interior of the cts to be plush without being annoying or distracting im guessing the car you saw at the auto show and the car i looked at had different interiors forgetting about the catera for a moment the cts and also in general the caddy lineup have decent interiors why is nobody talking about the mercedes and cadillac excellent question it appears attending forum members are not so keen about the above marques myself included what surprises me most is the lack of interest in audi the audi a3 is one great performance vehicleespecially the upcoming 32fsi quattro version i guess to each their own hmmm guess well have to agree to disagree here actually bob lutz had a great quote about the cts interior to paraphrase he said we actually used very expensive materials in the cts interior we just made them look cheap it was in an issue of autoweek this summer perception is reality the sts interior is better but it does cost a bit more compared to their peers well caddy needs to borrow a lexus designer and materials buyer i think mbs are great looking cars but i cant overlook the reliability problems i thought the mb c230 handled great but again if its in the shop all the time what fun is i agree i would take those cars over a caddy any day too although the caddy got some great reviews dead last in this segment the thing dipped and swayed in corners it was maddeningly softto the point of feeling like it was designed for an entirely different segment the rest of the cars in this group track correctly and without drama in corners to say i loathed my experience in the cts would be a gross understatement wretched wretched car worst salesperson ive encountered in years guy scoffed when i said i wanted to drive a manual he kept asking how i liked it and when i was honest placing it far below the competition posed by the g a4 3 series he would always offer the same answer ah but those arent cadillacs what does that mean should\\ni be impressed by a company name my bad pardon my last post with great insight i just determined that a a3 is an inappropriate topic for a sedan forum sick hmmm inappropriate though it may be im coming out of three consecutive sedans and im looking at virtually all of the cars covered by this topic including the a3 best regards\\nshipo theres no reason to completely eliminate talk about sedan competitors that are not techincally sedans such as the a3 the lines between body styles get blurrier and blurrier we shouldnt get too caught up in vehicles that arent strictly our subject but some side comparisons are fine  check this out httpwwwconsumerreportsorgmaincontentdisplay_reportjspfolder3c3efolder_id77276 3assortment3c3east_id389451bmuid1126202086364 not surprising at all as ive always maintained most cars do worse than epa in the city and better than epa on the highway also real world mileage of bmws as with most other manufacturers arent anything to call home about well thanks for the clarification about this topic audi a3 vs audi a4 avant cant imagine why anybody would buy the more expensive a4 when the a3 is the better performer and handler in addition a3 interior space is almost equivalent to the a4 avant  another advantage for most north americans who do not like manual is that the a3 t has dsgan option that is unavailable in the current a4 personally i prefer manual myself the only issue i have with this apparently terrific car all audis actually is  where do you draw the line i mean if the a3 fits your needs then why not consider the jetta or golf same beautiful build same performance same amenities cheaper price i mean if the a3 fits your needs then why not consider the jetta or golf same beautiful build same performance same amenities cheaper price beautiful build i know its subjective but man the jetta is so ugly sandra bernhard was heard making fun of the cars appearance really the jetta gli is outrageously bad looking in person it looks like someone crossed a 4x4 with a pill bug same performance not really the a3 has returned 63 060 sprints with dsg the jetta gli is consistenly getting 67 and above as for handling theres no comparing them either yes the have some of the same underpinnings but the displacement of the weight is different and the cars handle markedly different ways i have not driven the gti yet but for now the next year or so it wont have the utility of the a3s 4 doors very different cars and the prices differencesarent there a3 with dsg open sky and sport is about 30k same stuff on a jetta gli is 28k httpwwwautomotorundsportded88304 translation a good 20 years after the entry of a turbo charger in the 745i for an increase in performance bmw as of 2006 once again turns to the turbo in order to pry out more power the 335 makes its debut as the strongest model of the 3er series below the powerful m3 the nomenclature would lead one to err as was the case in the 1980s instead of a 35 l motor literally equipment there is a 3 l straight 6 cylinder with two turbochargers and piezo direct fuel injection by siemens this will put out ca 340 ps horsepower visually the potent 3er will show its power with dual exhausts along side the 3er we can expect an m version of the 1er and further bmw will test a 4 l v8 biturbo as well as a 2 l 4 cyl turbo if thats true i may have to return to bmw sooner than i originally planned 340 hp and its biturbo egad that thingd smoke an e46 m3 and with biturbos one of my chief complaints about bmw torqueless engines will be answered you gotta expect at least 300 ftlbs of torque very different cars and the prices differences quattro for the audi 32 is a key selling point for me would pick a quattro over any comparable fwd vw instead of a 35 l motor literally equipment there is a 3 l straight 6 cylinder with two turbochargers and piezo direct fuel injection by siemens this will put out ca 340 ps horsepower visually the potent 3er will show its power with dual exhausts surprise beautiful build i was referring to the interior design and materials exterior appearance is subjective and fwiw im lukewarm to both same performance well i havent driven either one and i havent seen any headtohead tests of the jetta and a3 im basing my opinion on their specifications if youve driven them sidebyside then ill concede to your firsthand experience based on my reading they both have the same underpinnings same wheelbase same engine and weigh within 50 lbs of each other my conclusion is that they are going to perform in a similar manner price differences if 2000 is insignificant to you ill email you with the address where you can send my check price differences if 2000 is insignificant to you ill email you with the address where you can send my check supposedly the audi servicewarranty is superior to vw and that initself may be worth the price differential then again i owned an audi many years ago and i cant even imagine how services could get any worse if thats true i may have to return to bmw sooner than i originally planned 340 hp and its biturbo egad that thingd smoke an e46 m3 so a 340hp 335i would get you back to bmw even when you all holla that its not about hp or speed  hmmmm well see how the 335i turns out and what price youd have to pay to acquire one same performance well i havent driven either one and i havent seen any headtohead tests of the jetta and a3 im basing my opinion on their specifications if youve driven them sidebyside then ill concede to your firsthand experience based on my reading they both have the same underpinnings same wheelbase same engine and weigh within 50 lbs of each other my conclusion is that they are going to perform in a similar manner i have driven both gearing can make all the difference the a3 being that its an audi may be geared to offer a bit more zest in performance id hope so price differences if 2000 is insignificant to you ill email you with the address where you can send my check for my happiness 2k is well worth it im not going worry about a lousy 2000 dollars if its the difference between me being 90 happy and 95 happy i paid a good 7k difference opting for the 330i performance package or a g35 mt havent regretted it once i can always make more moneybut being happy thats something worth paying for so a 340hp 335i would get you back to bmw even when you all holla that its not about hp or speed  hmmmm well see how the 335i turns out and what price youd have to pay to acquire one do you have any idea why im not opting for a e90 330i 1 because only the handling is better than my e46s\\n2 the setups not as engaging as my e46 perf pack\\n3 if i have to put up with how unreliable bmws are then i want the car to be ludicrously fun an e90 is not ludicrously fun neither is my e46 my plan assuming an e90 335i is not announced is to buy something simple and cheap  like an s2000 or miata ill drive that for 2 or 3 years and wait for the e90 m3 sedan the e90 m3 sedan assuming it comes out should satisfy me to a level of 9192 the 335i allows me to avoid having something as garish as an m on my car and no ostentatious gills on the fenders plus the 335i would address something i hate about the current 3 series line up  no torque i have stated several times i prefer vws 20t to my e46s inline 6 i like the full blast of torque from 18005000 rpm having over 300 ftlbs of torque over a broad range of the powerband in an e90 would suddenly take the decent car to a higher level  nice handling ideally tightened up more for the 335i matched to power for once the g35 is faster than an e46 and e90 so what the cars got snap oversteer issues i want the whole package sublime handling crazy power and 4 doors as for price bmw bumped the price of the 325i to 330i about 45k id hope the same bump would occur to the 335i and then the m3 would ring in at 5055k starting if i can outfit a 335i at 45k with just leather sport paint ill be happy so a 340hp 335i would get you back to bmw even when you all holla that its not about hp or speed  hmmmm well see how the 335i turns out and what price youd have to pay to acquire one right its not all about hp and speed but when you add hp and speed to an existing bmw with the handling and feel then its even better right on like a subpar m3 at subpar m3 prices for my happiness 2k is well worth it i totally agree with you just consider that drivers as picky and enthusiastic as you and i are in the minority for 90 of buyers out there the only significant difference between these two cars is the cargo configuration and badge on the hood right its not all about hp and speed but when you add hp and speed to an existing bmw with the handling and feel then its even better all of these on a 70mph freeways  the most notable thing about these cars is their pronounced hash rides where you feel all the ruts and imperfections of the road if that is your idea of driving more power to you then whats all of the hoopla about more horsepower and razor edge handling if none of the that mattered the public would have spoken and wed all be driving kias and hyundias you cant get razor edge handling in a car that has a soft suspension and what good is 300 horses if most of us live in a traffic clogged suburban or urban area where average speeds are 2025mph the most notable thing about these cars is their pronounced hash rides where you feel all the ruts and imperfections of the road if that is your idea of driving more power to you i want to feel it all come through my steering wheel if i have to put up with how unreliable bmws are then i want the car to be ludicrously fun you are a rare breed indeed amongst performance car buyers unlike you if my bmw would have major reliability issuesi would seek any car but a bmw just after my warranty expired i received a 55k dollar bill of repairs at a bmw dealership got a alternative quote from an independent of 650brake pad replacements if i had to pay 55k in repairs i can guarantee you i would be owning a japanese performanceluxury sedan so after 7 years why do i still own my bimmerbecause currently my cars maintenance costs can outlexus any lexus if i am going to enjoy any performance carthough i am pushing the definition of performance by calling my 168hp 99 bmw323 a performance car then it would have to be reliable to each their own though i am pushing the definition of performance by calling my 168hp 99 bmw323 a performance car i think your definition of performance is spoton you may not have m3 horsepower but you also dont carry the extra 300 lbs and you dont feel the road through wheelstires that are almost a foot wide and weigh 50 lbscorner anyone can drive a 300 hp car quickly but it takes real skill to go fast with only half the horses and its more fun ill take light weight and a responsive chasis over hp any day  thats my definition of performance i agree that hp is not everything but i really like the m3 and m5 however with respect to bmws i am concerned about reliability but i must add cr does recommend the 3 series bmw because of recent good reliability ratings ill take light weight and a responsive chasis over hp any day  thats my definition of performance i agree hp in itself does not make performance agreed hp is not everything the g35 330c hemi and the is350 have tons of hp two out of three dont impress me and thats only because i havent driven the lexus i just cant see spending 40k on a 330i e90  great handling nice ride perfect interior but lacking in verve its easy to improve handling with simple mods wheels sways springs etc but really getting extreme hp comes from the factory or it requires some warranty crushing mods like the folks who turbo their e46 330is going fast in corners driving a slow car is fun\\ngoing faster in corners driving a really faster car is way more fun i believe the minimum hp for any car should be 240 for me to consider the car and anything over 300 hp is a waste of gas then again 200 hp is good for most all purpose driving but i like the added power p how is 300 hp a waste of gas youre assuming quite a bit who needs a 400 hp vette just a waste of gas imho mb has a 12 cylindar car why the speed limit in most of the us is 65 so why the need of all this hp just a waste of gas a limited resource btw you bought a car with 250 hp right tl so please dont babble about how one doesnt need power we all want it you did too or you would have bought a cylinder camry  better gas mileage more room etc these are luxury performance sedans performance is in the title the 65 mph speed limit thing is a weak argument position regarding hp hp has little to do with top speed or acceleration a car with 135 hp can break the limit without breaking a sweat theres nothing illegal about strongly accelerating away from the onramp stoplights or accelerating out of a corner strongly also many people track their cars remember this forum is about cars that luxury items toys these are not necessary vehicles theyre toys who needs a 400 hp vette just a waste of gas imho err the 400 hp corvette gets 1828 epa not that different from most v6 sedans take 30 off the city number for a more realistic estimate of city and stop and go yes there is a big difference between needs and wants nobody needs any of the cars in this thread but take away wants and you kill capitalism and fun ahem my 350 hp corvette makes 37 mpg highway according to the sticker on the windshield take 30 off the city number for a more realistic estimate of city and stop and go and that applies to most other cars including all cars in this class that applies to just about any car ok ok i stand corrected cheez p and what good is 300 horses if most of us live in a traffic clogged suburban or urban area where average speeds are 2025mph excellent point how many people with lots of hp underutilize their vehicles in citysuburban mundane type of driving  going back and forth to work each day or out shopping i suppose their answer is that they could go fast if they wanted to how many have lots of hp and handling and live way out in rural areas where they can truly put handling and hp to use probably not too many i see many folks in corvettes bmws driving very sedately on interstates when i pass them in one of my vehicles minvan many are driving about the same pace as golden seniors in their fullsize fords and mercurys they dont want to be noticed by police i guess maybe a large point of it all is to be seen in it and the perceived prestige notice that a lot of bmw corvette hummer etc type of owners like to park their vehicles in the driveway of their mcmansions in the suburbs rather than pulling into the garage they will even put them in prominent angles so that driversby can view them better wow youre pretty smart grouping all bmw corvette and hummer drivers into one tidy little package can you see my tongue firmly planted in my cheek i drive my cinnabar red bmw pretty sedately around town and on the freeway  not much fun no matter what your speed except for an occasional onramp apex or sunday am country backroad romp i basically save my tiresbrake pads for the racetrack where i can really enjoy them in a controlled environment oh yeah i always park my bmw in the garage it keeps my car cleaner longer which means i washwax less frequently it also protects the dash seats and paint from premature fading or cracking and helps keep the interior temperature more comfortable yearround finally it also keeps the car out of view of potential thieves so much for stereotypes huh notice that a lot of bmw corvette hummer etc type of owners like to park their vehicles in the driveway of their mcmansions in the suburbs rather than pulling into the garage they will even put them in prominent angles so that driversby can view them better how many garages are big enough to fit a hummer thats my guess as to why you see them in the driveways wow youre pretty smart grouping all bmw corvette and hummer drivers into one tidy little package can you see my tongue firmly planted in my cheek you are misquoting me you said that i said all but i used the term lot big difference my quote from previous message notice that a lot of bmw corvette hummer etc type of owners like to park their vehicles in the driveway of their mcmansions in the suburbs rather than pulling into the garage were here to talk about the cars not our impressions of the drivers  yes its dangerous to gun it in traffic and you are likely to get a big ticket my wife and i go driving to the ca gold country where there are few cars and people and then open it up you are misquoting me i used the term lot a stereotype is a stereotype comments like that are insulting and dont belong here smart money magazine came out with their rankings of the 2006 cars by class  they rank the audi a4 as best in this class of course for you hp fans this is one of the

bmw needs to wake up and offer bluetooth as a standard option have they integrated the satellite antenna or are they still using the black addon style i am curious as to see how the bluetooth will be displayed without nav why do you need a display with bluetooth a wireless headset doesnt have a display and it works in conjunction with a cell phone same principlethe car becomes one giant wireless headset billyperks i need for you to drop me an email as soon as possible  pat at edmundscom  thanks not sure they mention their methodology and sources  but some of it seems to be their road testing the great thing about magazines and the internet is that it makes an opinion seem very important quite frankly there are a few magazines that really see that a car is to get you from point a to point b reliably and inexpensively well to the masses as opposed to the superrich inexpensive is below 25k a toyota avalon at 40k or a bmw 5 series at 60k while certainly nice cars dont fulfill the missive of inexpensive so to that end all magazines that are self proclaimed carreview specialists get reviewed and the information promptly ignored having said that i like cars over 25k also but most magazines such as forbes money etc that publish these recommendations carry the same weight as my friends opinion thats why i rely on cr a nonprofit who i believe shoots straight they do but their evaluations have not meshed with mine for a very long time therefore i find the only way to find a car is to knock on every dealers door and test drive every car you may be interested in and thats what i do in the end i make the decision based on the utilityform and function and financials nothing else i dont consult the statistics purveyors or the mags oh and if possible i do consult with people who have these cars to find out their experiences with the car and the dealer the only time in many many years i had buyers remorse is when i didnt get the m3 depends upon what your criteria are cr doesnt always give me what im looking for in their evaluation whats important to one person isnt always whats important to another just because an organizationpublication is nonprofit and doesnt accept ads doesnt excuse them from all bias which is a natural human condition they do have their own biases which thankfully are less virulent in the automotive sector their board is dominated by consumer advocate types who believe strongly in government regulation and intervention an approach that can actually work against consumer choices and intangibles such as performance click here 1st

the more appropriate lexus is 300 discussion here is a link christina271 lexus is 300 2968 19 sep 2005 521 pm really cant disagree strongly with the rankings especially the 330i i think the tl is a bit under under rated but in terms of handling the mb c class is very good did cd complain the the c had too little hp between the lexus is 350 and the e90 330ia nyccarguy bmw 3series 2006 4340 19 sep 2005 1122 pm hop over there and check it out then come back here to discuss  hmmm i test drove a c350 about 5 weeks ago and my dealer had a half dozen of them i guess the dealers have a lot more clout than cd or maybe daimlerbenz recognized the cd bias toward bmw the is thrashed the bmw on all objective criteria but lost on the subjective criteria and a calculation error in adding up the final results cr explains what they test and how they test it in their latest issue it is all pretty objective i once thought they had a bias toward lexus but after reading the sep 05 issue i am convinced they are completely objective what is most interesting is that they dont get a specially prepared car from the factory for their tests like all the car mags do they go to a dealer and buy one off the floor just like you and i do the is thrashed the bmw on all objective criteria but lost on the subjective criteria every magazine ive read said the is has overboosted numb steering this alone should be enough to knock the lexus off the podium in a sport sedan comparo but how do you measure it objectively if objective numbers are all that matter save 15000 and buy that 300 hp pontiac grand prix gxp you know you want the is thrashed the bmw on all objective criteria but lost on the subjective criteria and a calculation error in adding up the final results the cd verdict was quite decisive in what car they favored lol if you reread that cd article you will realize the bmw over is choice was a bit more than a calculation error and subjectivity every is review i read so far had the following to say in all their final paragraphsthe is is a great car but certainly not a 3 series subjectivity call it what you like httpwwwgermancarfanscomnewscfmnewsid2050919006bmw1html the terms bmw and fuel efficeincy are rarely used in the same sentenceexcept future hydrogen vehicles the website linked above indicates that bmw is currently taking fuel efficiency quite seriously 1bmw is therefore now becoming the first car maker in the world to offer high precision injection as a solution appropriate for largescale production saving fuel to an extent in practice simply unparalleled by other technologies 2brake energy regeneration and automatic startstop substantial improvement of fuel economy without forfeiting that driving pleasure so typical of bmw 3the second major component of bmw146s technology package is the automatic engine startstop system being introduced as 147auto startstop148 this system will automatically switch off the engine in an increasingly large number of models in future as soon as the car comes to a standstill for example at the traffic lights then as soon as the driver presses down the clutch or operates the gas pedal the engine starts again automatically the terms bmw and fuel efficeincy are rarely used in the same sentenceexcept future hydrogen vehicles the website linked above indicates that bmw is currently taking fuel efficiency quite seriously with the 3 series i think of the cars as fuel efficient over 30 mpg at 95 mph all day through the desert is pretty darn impressive 2030 for the new 3series 2129 for the 5series and 1725 for the big 750li 48l v8 the bmw gas mileage that really amazes me is the x5 48is at 1621 with that same v8 in an suv i don146t mean to rub it in but on a recent trip in my 530ia i got 334 mpg pure highway averaging 70 mph\\x85 and that was headed into the prevailing westerlies my 4cyl outback doesn146t even get that much a friend of mine said he got almost 600 miles on a tank pure highway with his 328 but they will drink when you whip them or languish in traffic in general the bimmers are pretty fuel efficient however i do agree that fuelefficiency and bmws is not a general perception probably because of the 147ultimate driving machine148 branding ive heard many anecdotal accounts of drivers get better than posted mpg in their bimmers when they drive them conservatively i think that most bmw drivers get less than the posted mpg because they drive them as they are meant to be driven therefore there is the public perception that bimmers dont get as good of gas mileage as they really do when driven like any other car ive heard many anecdotal accounts of drivers get better than posted mpg in their bimmers when they drive them conservatively i think that most bmw drivers get less than the posted mpg because they drive them as they are meant to be driven therefore there is the public perception that bimmers dont get as good of gas mileage as they really do when driven like any other car hmmm i dont think you get what i wrote and what many will back up at hyperlegal speeds were getting over epa estimates with bmws these cars are geared and designed for the autobahnsixth gear at 95 and werestill not even at 4k rpm i dont baby my car in the least 5k rpm shifts are standard for my car when its warmed up if you reread the article you would find under bmw statements such as repeated attempts to start and brake failure just what i want in a performance sedan the is started every time and the brakes worked you are right it is not a 3 series i believe they also understated the epa estimates for the is should be 2128 i dont own an is but i know bias when i see it funny thing my 330i has been out of commission the past two days two different sensors went out one right after another and the x3 loaner im driving has a christmas tree of lights blinking on the dash yet im looking forward to hopping back in my 330i and unless i can get into a is350 for less than 35k with leather sport xenons moon ill probably 85 sure end up in an e90 ideally a 335i will be available sometime in 2006 so i can extend my lease to get to the 335i is that bias no if the is350 offered a better driving experience itd win my purchase who knows maybe it doesbut given the reviews that seems unlikely what is most interesting is that they dont get a specially prepared car from the factory for their tests like all the car mags do they go to a dealer and buy one off the floor just like you and i do that is why i trust cr more than others if you reread the article you would find under bmw statements such as repeated attempts to start and brake failure just what i want in a performance sedan i agree and most reviewers including cd agree with your above assertionthe e90 is exactly what you would want as a performance sedan it does get great mileage on the freeways but in the cities its horrible i only get about 300 miles on a full tank and i dont even push it i drive conservatively  main reason being the breakin period is this normal i mean i know u get way less in the cities but 300 miles perhaps im just paranoid i dont know whats your beef 300 miles on a full tank its pretty normal on city driving at least thats the kind of range ive been getting on my tl and im a pretty conservative driver and this is driving with maybe 50 of the time using the ac saigon mileage will improve i shift at over 4500 rpm most of the time after warm up 75 to wot for me is pretty common too and i still get 22 mpg around town hmmm miles per tankful is a pretty poor way to guage fuel efficiency since there is a small factor called size of the tank my buddy gets way more miles per tankful in his motor home but then it costs him over 300 when he finally fills it up  in my normal aroundtown easy driving i get about 25 mpg in my e46 325 and 30 in highway driving thats about 12 mpg worse than my previous car an a4 18t but then the 325i has a bigger more powerful engine and id expect a difference like that these comparisons whether in a magazine or on this message board are always subjective even an objective comparison usually has subjectivity in the categories that the comparison includes and how theyre measured i think we also all have various prejudices in viewing different brands for example if i were buying an american car i would look at gm and chrysler but would not even walk into a ford dealership why i have no idea but ive never liked fords in a similar way i could see myself in a nissaninfiniti or hondaacura but would never consider a toyotalexus product that may be just me but i suspect that there are similar prejudices lurking inside all of us oh absolutely many of the brand perceptions people have date back many years to their initial perceptions as an example my wife still thinks of mercedes as top of the line can do no wrong despite several years of electronic problems i still think of bmw at first gut reaction not so much as the leader but as the yuppie brand  until i think about it i know several people in their 40s who would never consider any american car because of issues from 25 years ago all of these post claiming 30mpg on the 330s and even the 530s really got jealous p  i guess i should have bought the last of the 05 330s\\nmy last 300miles to greensboro nc in my 03 maxima only got me roughly 27mpg  roughly 70mph however on my way back to wash dc somewhere allong i85 i got into a chase with a tl and a 325i for about 25 min we hit 105mph before we got to petersburg va and had to slow down it was a bit nerve recking because that section of i85 has only 2 lanes each way so we were basically blowing past the slower 70mph traffic in the next lane blush the guy in the 325i gave up once we hit 95mph\\nhowever according to consumerreportsorg the 330 225hp mileage doesnt look all that impressive for overall driving its less efficient than the 04 tl 270hp and equal the 03 tls 260hp confuse\\ni guess to get that kind of claimed mileage one better start taking a vacant freewayinterstate which sometimes translates to a longer route to work\\ni also have a 03 tls maybe i should take it on my next trip to see what kind of mileage it gets drove my 1995 318ti from atlanta to daytona 450 miles on one tank 135 gallons oh and i averaged about 90 mph in my 30s as are my friends ive helped about 8 people buy cars in the past 3 years not a single one would even look at an american brand they flat out refused i believe the american brands have lost my generation  especially on the west coast euro and japanese brands are all theyll consider american brands are considered junk here dont forget tonights membertomember chat  its open mic night so come and discuss whatevers on your mind 67pm pt910pm et

must be done outside of car gas mileage in the teens uh no thanks that many on the lexus board are screaming about how could cd choose the bmw over the new is350 the is350 is faster had a great braking distance and the bmws brakes failed i think for these guys it is really about the drive and the way the car flows everything together the fact that the brakes failed doesnt enter into their mind i know a few people who owned alfa romeos in the 60s 70s  80s they all tell me the same thingthe car was in the shop all the time but it was so much damn fun to drive they all say theyd buy

i like the miata more lighter on its feet but you gotta admit thats a heck of a lot of car for the money ok i admit the topdown thing is a minus nah one less thing to go wrong make believe it146s an old porsche or your spyder i think the sky styling is much better very cool saw a solstice on the road for the first time yesterday definitely looks sporty albeit a bit too playful toylike on the front end despite the name of this forum i cant help but notice the emphasis among many forum members with mpg mpg has become as important as performance or luxury also during the frankfurt show the focus was not so much on the new gasconsuming mb s series as on new fuel efficeincy endeavors by all attending auto makers is it mere coincidence that the two major exhibitsthe mb s series and the audi q7 have futue hybrid versions in fact most of the excitement was reserved for any car that boosted fuel efficiency definety the sign of the times maybe sometime in the future the best performance luxury sedans available will not be defined by its performance or luxury the best future luxury performance sedan will be defined by how well it consumes gas at a given level of performanceluxury i meant to say north east but in any event it is the same thing\\ngood luck driving in the ice and snow with your rwd good luck hmmm im thinking that it is more a matter of a very competent car 530i and a very good set of winter tires michelin arcticalpin oh and a modicum of driver competence as well  over the years ive driven them all awd 4wd fwd and rwd and my 530i shod with winter tires has been

and had uncomfortable hard rear seats\\nthere was a big bump on the course that really upset the cars with the bmw tracking the best over it\\non the street the 325 felt great in normal driving but the tight interior convinced me that i made the best choice for myself and my family by buying the g35\\noh well theres my 02\\nps on the street the 540 was nice and roomy but the only word that comes to mind when describing the interior is sterile ill take an m35 or 45 any day the z4 just seemed like a toy not my cup of tea describing the interior is sterile i like sterile when i drive less is more ditto must be the german in me i like things austere maybe back in the eighties when i was in junior high sterile would be acceptable i saw an m on a website and didnt like the looks but anyone here test drive one i like the g thanks in advance this is really offtopic to this board why dont you hope on over to the luxury performance sedans board describing the interior is sterile i like sterile when i drive less is more maybe that wasnt quite the right word to use i also feel that the e90 does not have as attractive a view from the drivers seat as the e46 with its more cockpitlike feel the e90s interior is less unique more generic less traditional bmw it seems more similar to what you might find in an audi not that thats bad  just not distinctively bmw even the cd review mentioned something about not caring for dash design true the e46 cockpit feel is missing in the e90 and that is a shame and the reason the e90 has become more generic is because it is less sterile than older bmws imo i favor sterilityfunctional designs over the ostentatioustrendy designs that are evident in all current performance sedans drivetrainchassis considerations are what drives into

2005 837 am is anyone in this forum old enough to remember when most people laughed when toyota introduced a luxury line called lexus or a few years ago when many would never think that a korean samsung can outwit sony in consumer electronics well here is something more current hyundai will be introducing a 35l rwd luxury sedan and should be on our shores early 07 httpwwwedmundscominsidelinedonewsarticleid107396 i keep mentioning hyundai pulling off what toyotas done in the past 16 years so far people scoff so did bmwmb in the 80s theyre not laughing at lexus now 15 years from now will hyundai be the new lexus i wouldnt count them out theyve gone from 1980s joke much like toyota was a joke in the 60s to strong value contender in the 00s much like toyota in the 80s its not beyond the realm of possibility for the 2020 hyundai al760 entry luxury sport sedan with 1500 hp to be the big contender aiming to knock off infiniti and lexus aging but still popular platforms yeah a lot of people just thought lexus was some gimmick although it seems crazy now im sure that korean cars will be generally accepted by the public within 1015 years yeah its hard to imagine suzuki and hyundai as mainstream cars but they said the same thing about japanese in the 70s the american big 3 laughed and then proceeded to get run over in their complacency just as a slight correction to a possibly offtopic post suzuki is japanese not korean and they have long been one of the big four japanese motorcycle manufacturers current or up to recently at least korean brands include hyundai kia and daewoo my bad yeah suzukis japanese i wouldnt call them part of any big four in this country internationally especially in asia they are big but not so much in the usa btw isnt daewoo automobile division long gone yeah suzuki is japanese but a few all of their cars are built in korea and funny thing you mention daewoo some of suzukis cars are originally daewoos see here for example httpcarsaboutcomcstestdrivesfrsuzuverona_testhtm\\ndumont\\n05 acura tl at navi yikes i guess we were both right p i am in sacramentoca and have ordered a mb c350 obsidian blackstone with all options excluding allleather and 4matic for invoice price750 costco deal i am a first time luxurycar buyer and had test drove bmw 325 lexus es330 and avalon ltd all 2006 within a span of 2 days the mb test drive was fantastic  smooth ride effortless and quiet acceleration very responsive steering rich interior interiorexterior looks are much better than the 2006 bmw 3 series i had test driven the bmw 325 in tight corners at about 4050 mph as i did with the mb and did not notice any significantsuperior handling that the beemerfans rave about i tested the bmw just hours before the mb and soon as i got into the mb i could see the superior appointments  the different can be instantly felt it was love at first sight the bmw had very bland interior and a straight black front panelling that i disliked old corolla look plus i found the driver seats a bit tight for my comfort both bmw and mb have horrible cupholders  the rear ones are too shallow for comfort on a price comparison loading the comparable bmw 330 with the same options as the c350 gave me a price higher by about 400 for the 330 so the beemer did not have price advantage over the mb except when you factor the freemaintainence for 4 years offered by bmw versus the 300year needed for the mb the lexus es 330 was cool but a bit elephantine for my needs same with the avalon which i found smootherquiter than the lexus good thing about the avalon was the new engine 260 hp plus and the flat flooring in the rear seat very cool for the center seat also the lexusavalon looks very camryish to me and i wanted to stand out from the crowd heh heh i did not notice significant difference between the c and s modes comfortsport in the feel of the car except during startup when it starts in 2nd gear in c mode for a smooth start i love the 2129 mpg rating since most of my driving is on freeways to work i will opt for michelin tires though instead of the standard allweather continental i also plan on getting the wheels chromed mbs look best when they shine avalon is an elephant on four wheels in comparison with bmw\\nand hesitation is terrible looked at an es and an avalon but yet drove a 325 at best shod in 17s and then compared it to the mb c350 so baffled drive a 330i with sport and youll understand then again you drove an avalon so odds are good sporty driving isnt yoru thing yes you are correcti was not looking for a pure sporty car  i wanted a good mix of luxury and sportiness my top speed is not going to be above 100mph and nor am i going to be whizzing around corners  moreover feedback from the road was desired to be minimal  but not so much as to dull the senses i was also impressed by the excellent reviews for the new mb engine upgrade and its smooth 7tranny i did not want the awd models saving on mpg and did not test drive the bmw 330i nor the c350 sport nor the mb 4matic options i got disinterested mostly pardon me pls if anyone is offended  by the interior of the 325 and hence did not try out the 330 not offended we all have likes and dislikes 3 series for my money has the best interior around i sat in a current a4 crreambeige and found it not to my liking all the other interiors are too foofoo for my tastes clean hard lines please both bmw and mb have horrible cupholders  the rear ones are too shallow for comfort ah yes the cupholder the absolute pinnacle of a cars worth for any driving enthusiast worth his salt driving should be about driving period alas in the us this is becoming less and less so actually operating the vehicle has become a tertiary activity at best consuming beverages solving crossword puzzles applying makeup etc is best left for times when one is not operating a motor vehicle ill take the car that performs on the road over one that best holds my beverage any day of the week just my two bits worth shades end of rant i also find it funny how many americans includeexclude certain cars based on cupholders i am american but i find this absolutely ridiculous and absurd do you think you might be able to make that trip home from the gas station without the 64oz biggie drink geez its just a reflection of our fattening society yes the germans seem to have it right the reason their cupholders stink is because they actually focus on building a good car not the best mobile drink carriercell phone holder lol i havent bought a new car since they started including cup holders not only do i want a cupholder for water bottles i may take around i want a nice and convenient feltline sunglass holder so i dont have to always put it in cases and then in glove compartments also want ipod support too as well as good wind and engine noise control doesnt have to be either or no reason a luxury performance sedan cant have amenities and be a good drive driving should be about driving period alas in the us this is becoming less and less so actually operating the vehicle has become a tertiary activity at best it is pretty sad people dont want to drive cars these days they want to drive their living room doesnt have to be either or no reason a luxury performance sedan cant have amenities and be a good drive sure as long as something like cupholders is not the reason you reject a luxury performance sedan why dont you pop for the fee to attend the xhileration event hosted by mercedes at race tracks around the country you could actually drive and compare the c350 to the 330 at a bonafide track ours was held at indy race park along with a dozen or more other cars it might change your opinion or at least give your opinion some credibility some credibility ive driven a cclass its not my kind of car i flat out dont like mb id take an acura infiniti undriven infiniti audi and pretty much anything nonamerican in this class over an mb to each his own i have no use for mb sorry it could be worse it could be a ctsgag i agree to each his or her own i think wco81 and johnny420 expressed the difference quite wellmb has chosen more luxury over performance and bmw has chosen more performance over luxury i think mbs are some beautiful cars and quite nice to drive i also think bmws are some beautiful cars crazy about the new 3 and the 3 is a blast to drive p i just recently attended a driving event where i drove the mb e350 and c350 and the bmw 325i on a closed course both mbs handle quite well but imo neither mb came close to matching the road grip turn handling and general tossability and pure driving fun of the 325i ive also driven the 330i sport pkg on a closed course recently and with its extra power its just that much more fun i absolutely love the tight right on steering of the 3s bmws just feel like they are built to be drivenfast shades 02 give me a e55 amg any day of the week and twice on sundays that car is a beast give me a e55 amg any day of the week and twice on sundays that car is a beast i wouldnt call e55 amg entrylevel luxury for the money id get an e39 m5 and maybe spend the price diff on s3 treatment sure dave the m5 is a monster too but i was trying to imply to blueguy that he shouldnt knock all mb cars\\npersonally i wouldnt buy a mb without the amg kit\\nc55 amg\\ne55 amg\\ns55 amg those are the ones i would buy for my wife the e350 4matic would suffice personally i wouldnt buy a mercedes with the amg kit why correct me if im wrong but at least here in the usa arent all amg versions equipped with a slushbox transmission ugh best regards\\nshipo correct me if im wrong but at least here in the usa arent all amg versions equipped with a slushbox transmission ugh i thought all amgs regardless of country have slushbox that wouldnt surprise me in the least p best regards\\nshipo i know its a slush box but they are pretty responsive and fast\\nthe c55 and audis s4 manual are neck and neck in a recent car magazine article i have test driven the e55 and that autamatic is something special but i see your point a real driver always leans towards a manual it sorta sounds like we are on the same page  ive driven plenty of cars that were a lot faster than my daily driver however if that car had an automatic transmission including a dsg type the car would contain zero lust factor as far as i was concerned while i absolutely believe that folks should be able to buy and drive what suits them the best and should never be criticized for said choice from my personal perspective at least automatic transmissions should be limited to minivans and other such pedestrian transportation said another way every car that is covered by this discussion should offer a three pedal manual transmission as at least an extra cost option period full stop the end  best regards\\nshipo my comment paste everything shipo just said here i would like to pose a couple of hot questions to all of you that have the ebony interior in any car that you have previously owned i also posted this on another tl site  is it as hot as i think it is in the summer  if so i am really conflicted because im trying to stay as cool as possible within my two ideal color combinations for an 06 6mt now that i have waited 3 years to get my tl when they finally offer wdp w ebony for 2006  got to love it  people are telling me that this may in fact be the warmer combination in the summer so cal than my second favorite anthracite w quartz please tell me it isnt so any opinions from any of you that have had previous cars w these general color combos is a dark exteriorlight interior a cooler temperature combo than light exteriordark interior logic would tell me that this is not the case but i have searched these forums for a while now and havent found anything definitive on this so far does the tl have the ability to drop the windows and open the sunroof from the fob ala 3 seriesg35 if so the color scheme wont be a problem with a tl in socal left in direct sun shining on the seats a dark exteriorlight interior should be a bit cooler but if the sun is directly overhead the dark exterior could be hotter light exterior and interior would be the coolest there are some things that you can do use a metallic sun shade leave the windows open a crack and the sun roof popped up when you come back to the car open all the windows and wait a minute before getting in also leave them open for a few minutes after driving off with the ac running yes the tl has the ability to open all windowssunroof from the fob i find it quite useful for just this reason i have been to germany many times and witnessed how bmw has been taking market from deimler bentz years ago mb cars had a special appearance not any longer especially in smaller cars\\ni have been twice on assembly and body lines and have seen that the company is ageing now came agressive japanies\\nby the way it was funny to see the parking lots at mb one can see a sea of cars all mb by the way it was funny to see the parking lots at mb one can see a sea of cars all mb i used to work for mbusa in the mid to late 1990s and for a while i was helping out on a project in stuttgart due to the fact that i was a consultant i was not allowed to drive a company car for insurance reasons so they rented me a bmw instead every morning as i pulled into the parking lot i got a serious hairy eyeball from the other folks  best regards\\nshipo thanks guys for the input i posed this heat question to some of the engineers at work and one of them told me to take two thermometers to the acura dealership at 2pm and quickly throw them into the two candidates passenger seats and let them bake in the closed cars for 20 minutes then open the drivers door of each car and observe the readings as they come down over the next 510 minutes this may be more telling than what i could tell from a subjective seatofthepants test not bad advice  i actually may do it my concern now after all this research is that even after using the techniques to cool the car prior to entering the ebony leather will retain heat longer than the quartz grey especially being trapped against my back side while the car is trying to cool on a hot summer day even though the ebony is beautiful the day in and day out hassle of the extra heat may drive me nuts after awhile and the beauty may turn out to really be only skin deep thanks blue player and aaargh for your comments  anthracite is starting to look cooler by the minute i have a suggestion that might give you the best of both worlds tint your windows i highly recommend llumar brand i have used llumar for over 20 years and it is excellent i have never had any problems with hazing or bubbling their top tier tint comes with a lifetime warranty choose the top of the line llumar product and im sure you will be pleased be sure to choose a metalized tint they have tints now that block virtually all uv rays and have high degrees of heat rejection you dont even have to get a really dark tint to do the job i always use about the second lightest tint and have very good results i am a big believer in white cars i live in the great state of texas and you know we have tons of hot sun i dont have empirical evidence but in my experience i have found that even light colored cars absorb significantly more heat than white cars do plus i admit i really like the brightness and cleanness of white even though it seems counterintuitive white actually hides dirt better than any other color high quality tinting also protects and preserves your interior if you have tinting on your windows and use a reflective sunshade shades in your windshield ill bet the black interior wont be too bad btw  leather adjusts temperature much faster and better than vinyl my 02 fwiw also btw  dont get the tint done by your dealer theyll charge you at least twice as much find a good llumar dealer and let them do the installation thats what your dealer would do and then double the price to you correct me if i am wrong but doesnt a metalized tint make it more difficult for the navi assuming you have one to function properly i dont really think so most navi systems now have an antenna on the roof though if your only radio antenna is in the back glass i think it can adversely affect reception thanks for the email makes sense in regards to the navi however just a quick fyi acura actually recommends not tinting the windows on the tl why does acura not recommend tinting sorrykinda corny i know acura would have to give me an exceptionally good reason not to tint i have tinted all my cars since 1982 and never had any problems i know lots of the car makers are using so called green glass but imo it doesnt do the job personally i think high quality tint looks nice but without question it significantly even dramatically reduces heat intrusion on the g35 the navi also has no external antenna tinting may effect reception for the gps im a top 10 expertpro licensed motorcycle road racer ive been through the kink at road america with one knee on the ground at 130mph the only thing between me and a stone retaining wall being 2 quarter sized contact patches and a set of vanson leathers ive broken my neck and shattered an arm only to return the following year to race again i race vehicles capable of 10 second 14 miles and 190mpg top speeds that go 4 through a turn within inches of each other again with only a helmet and leathers as protection my m45 sport has an automatic transmission from the attitudes some have on this board i guess that makes me a wussy and my car an incapable pedestrain transporter sdiver so you enjoy driving a car with an automatic to each his own sounds like you have an exciting time racing motorcycles ive always admired motorcycle racers because nothing looks more fun and dangerous i can understand why youd want a car with an automatice youve probably had enough of shifting gears yourself m i havent read the is350 board lately so i dont know if you test drove the is350 yet if so what did you think and is it on your list m my m45 sport has an automatic transmission from the attitudes some have on this board i guess that makes me a wussy and my car an incapable pedestrain transporter well i say if the shoe fits ive also raced motorcycles but strictly on an amateur basis youre probably familiar with grattan but anyway the days of manual transmissions as we know them might be slowly coming to an end with the technology in bmws smg or even trickier audis dsg gearboxes the performance of these cars with 7 or more gears and a direct mechanical connection no torque converter with millisecondlevel shift times will make manualclutch cars slower and clunkier to drive manual gearboxes will be around for a long time yet but will be relegated to a vintage role driven only by middleaged geezers hey ive been driving mostly stick shifts for over 40 years now but even i can see the handwriting on the wall manual gearboxes will be around for a long time yet but will be relegated to a vintage role driven only by middleaged geezers ill be 1 of the middledaged geezers thatll refuse to give up the 3rd pedal hmmm my eleven year old son and my eight year old daughter cannot wait to learn how to drive a stick shift i suppose that would make them teenage geezers thatll refuse to give up the third pedal once they are old enough to learn speaking of old enough im thinking that a large empty parking lot fifteen years of age and dad in the right seat sounds old enough to me  best regards\\nshipo manual gearboxes will be around for a long time yet but will be relegated to a vintage role driven only by middleaged geezers hey ive been driving mostly stick shifts for over 40 years now but even i can see the handwriting on the wall hmm people have been saying that for the last 50 years im spartacus no im spartacus i too will be one of those geezers with a traditional three pedal configuration by the way to my knowledge no one here ever used or implied the word wussy or anything similar to it in reference to people who prefer automatics please refrain from making strawman arguments in the future ok is there such a thing as an automaticonly true performance sedan not in my book certainly not in europe or asia only in america is such an oxymoron possible sad but any car that truly holds itself out as a performance sedan needs at least the option of a manual tranny manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver excitement and slushbox dont seem to be compatible no one should drive an automatic without a doctors excuse buying an automatic in a sports sedan  its like forcing jessica alba to wear a sackcloth all the time this strawman has a backbone good thing you qualified your statement with to my knowledge and in not one of those statements did anyone use a derogatory term for drivers of automatics straw man still exists all europe drives cars with manual transmission i think automatic is against the spirit of bmw 3 series i am 70 and i have 06 325i with manual\\nlehrer1 manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver always is a very hard statement consider the f1 cars no true gearstick and third pedal for them paddle shifters are faster that technology is trickling down to commercial vehicles i will agree that the enthusiast may always prefer traditional manuals assuming that they are still offered no its not lol whatever you made an unfounded accusation insulting too and when called out on it you posted a bunch of quotes that do not in any way back up the assertion someone here called automatic drivers wussies your claim is disingenuous at best always is a very hard statement consider the f1 cars no true gearstick and third pedal for them paddle shifters are faster that technology is trickling down to commercial vehicles i will agree that the enthusiast may always prefer traditional manuals assuming that they are still offered paddle shifters f1 style or dsg are still manual ie no torque converter so the statement about manual being faster than automatic is still true paddle shifters f1 style or dsg are still manual ie no torque converter so the statement about manual being faster than automatic is still true do the f1 and dsg paddle shifters have the third pedal because if they do theyre not called manual at least according to some of the enthusiasts on this board p hmmm my eleven year old son and my eight year old daughter cannot wait to learn how to drive a stick shift shipo i myself will be contributing to posterity i am educating my two children4 and 7 years old on the virtues of manual i am crossing my fingers that by the time they are teens they will be manual enthusiasts this is one of my most important goals for their education other than the 3 rs do the f1 and dsg paddle shifters have the third pedal because if they do theyre not called manual at least according to some of the enthusiasts on this board they have a clutch so they are manuals do i want that type of manual no i prefer ones with a 3rd pedal do the f1 and dsg paddle shifters have the third pedal because if they dontsic theyre not called manual at least according to some of the enthusiasts on this board  true i and many others use the term manual to refer to a traditional transmission using a clutch pedal and h pattern shifter requiring input from the driver consider it shorthand also when i refer to an automatic im referring to cars equipped with torque converters and gearboxes that dont require input from the driver yes that includes you steptronic just because f1  dsg type transmissions dont have the third pedals doesnt make them automatics im not sure how the dsg functions but i know that f1 cars wont change gears without the driver flipping the little paddle so theyre definitely not automatics sometime in the future well have to come up with a new name for these hybrids but thats a discussion for another topic the third pedal is dead long live the third pedal they have a clutch so they are manuals just because f1  dsg type transmissions dont have the third pedals doesnt make them automatics its an automatic clutch this makes them automatics call it a semiautomatic or whatever you want but its still an automatic and nothing like a true manual transmission where the driver is an actual part of the drive train suffice to say this extremely well qualified expert feels the whole manual over automatics performance superiority complex its a question of preferences has nothing to do with qulifications or superiority heres a good breakdown on how the dsg works httpwwwcanadiandrivercomarticlesjk031119htm inside the computer controlled gearbox there are four shafts two input shafts and two output shafts the input shafts are concentric with one shaft passing through the centre of the other hollow input shaft there are two multiplate clutch packs similar to those found in automatic transmissions each clutch pack connects one of the input shafts to the engine so depending upon which is applied either one of the two input shafts can transfer power an oil pump at the rear of the gearbox supplies hydraulic pressure for the clutches the speed gears are divided between the two output shafts first third fifth and reverse gear are on one output shaft while second fourth and sixth gears are on the other shaft synchronisers are moved by the computer to lock each of the speed gears to their output shaft as required each output shaft has a pinion gear that drives the differential when the driver places the shift lever in drive first gear is engaged inside the transmission but the clutch doesnt engage until the driver steps on the gas because the clutch is running in oil it can slip without burning up allowing the car to creep along in first gear just as an automatic would step harder on the gas and the clutch is fully applied a neat feature of the control system allows the driver to step on the gas and brake at the same time audi calls it launch control and it allows f1type starts in sport mode with both pedals pressed the engine revs to 3200 rpm release the brake and the car launches in drag strip fashion with the transmission engaged in first gear the computer locks second gear to the other output shaft but the input shaft clutch for that gear is not engaged when it is time to shift the computer releases the clutch for the first gear input and engages the clutch for the second gear input in preparation for the next shift the computer now shifts from first to third gear but leaves its clutch disengaged until the shift is requested as the cars speed increases the computer continues to preselect the next gear so all it has to do is switch clutches there is no grinding no delays and no shock by monitoring driving style the computer predicts whether the driver will request an upshift or downshift next so it can preselect the correct gear it is possible to fool the computer by driving erratically but even if the wrong gear is preselected it only takes a fraction of a second for it to catch up this transmission shifts fast with shift times in the 03 to 04 second range even an excellent driver has trouble matching that consistently and this transmission can do it all day long its an automatic clutch this makes them automatics call it a semiautomatic or whatever you want but its still an automatic and nothing like a true manual transmission where the driver is an actual part of the drive train if youre definition of automatic is computer controled clutch then smg dsg etc are automatics youre the first i know of who defines automatic that way since majority of people  most automotive mags define automatic as having a torque converter and manual as having a clutch folks this is a matter about which everyone is entitled to choose the personal confrontations going on here are inappropriate  you like what you like  allow others the same freedom thanks blueguy fascinating article ill have to look into driving one soon manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver cool my manny tranny hyundai accent is faster than an automatic corvette im headin out to blow some highpriced doors off as you were i dug everything about the dsg but the weird sensation of the car going into neutral a moment before you pull to a stop your brain screams theres no clutch pedal and im coastingdanger danger danger okay maybe only my brain screams that in between woefully singing cyndi lauper songs in barry gibbs voice oh how i long for the days i imagined kathie lee gifford and r lee ermey singing marine corps marching duets darn xanax i have similar panic attacks driving regular automatics xanax is okay but it wasnt helping enough so i switched to heroin things are much better now errr i fall into that category as well to my way of thinking if the car only has two pedals and can shift for itself its an automatic  best regards\\nshipo what if it has two pedals but you have to shift for it im having trouble deciding which catagory that would belong to or whether or not it should have its own catagory what if it has two pedals but you have to shift for it in my mind at least thats easy its a semiautomatic  best regards\\nshipo perhaps there is problem with the general perception of transmission genre the term 147sequential manual148 is somewhat of a misnomer only half accurate hence misleading both gear selection and torque conversion can be automated the major difference between the true manual transmission and all others151conventional automatic sequential gearbox and cvt151is that with the true manual transmission the human being is not only the shifter he is also the torque converter by way of the clutch pedal he is an integral part of the transmission mechanism it is the only type of transmission where torque conversion is not achieved automatically perhaps another problem with perception is the term 147torque converter148 although it is a specific part in the automatic transmission torque conversion happens in all types of transmissions but is not commonly associated with any type of transmission except the 147automatic148 now to further convolute this mess we must realize that the transmission itself151any transmission151is a torque converter the part known as the 147torque converter148 is a transmission within a transmission it may sound confusing but this may be because there are snags in the naming conventions to begin with anyway the bottom line of this rant is that with the manual transmission and only the manual transmission\\x85 human being  torque converter oooooh i like the way you think human being  torque converter hey i resemble that remark  best regards\\nshipo hey i resemble that remark indeed your reputation precedes you if anyone is mr mt on edmunds yooda man with deference to blueguy also although he has been sniffing out that is350 so i don146t know  hey what about me i even have the name copywrited in any case i may have to give up on my true manual gearbox car as the other day i almost had an accident spilling my starbucks latte grande in my lap while trying to dial my cell phone and having to shift gears at the same time actually on a related topic i almost had a headon collision the other day on a bike path of all places when a teenage girl coming the other way didnt see me because she was dialing her cell phone while riding her bicycle mad  i believe the name of the corporation that manufactures mercedes is daimlerchrysler in any case i may have to give up on my true manual gearbox car as the other day i almost had an accident spilling my starbucks latte grande in my lap while trying to dial my cell phone and having to shift gears at the same time when i drive cell phone stays in the briefcase and no open containers since no cup holders dont think wife will like it if i refer to her as cupholder i just focus on joy of driving i drive manual while on the cell phone drinking a cup of black coffee while refereeing my children from behind and taking the proper dosage of my medication while driving in a congested city street the above situation happens almost daily and i would never ever consider an alternative to my good old fashioned stick my cel phone has a speaker setting that lets me keep both hands free to drive my entrylevel luxury performance sedan uh i think gordonwd had his tongue firmly in cheek since we were on this subject recently heres a really funny article from slate magazine about taking driving lessons for a manual trans hope posting this link is legal here httpslatemsncomid2128407navtap1 speed rt comparo 1 330i\\n2 g35\\n3 is350 the 330i and g35 were both 6mt 060 14 mile g35 58s 144s\\nis350 60s 145s\\n330i 62s 149s 600 g35 116 ft\\n330i 124 ft\\nis350 128 ft they said that the rankings were heavily biased toward sport and performance and would have been very different with luxury factored in more the is was definitely the luxury champ is this in the dec issue m hmm havent we been hearing lowmid 5s for the is350 those speed numbers for the lexus are disappointing slalom whats interesting to me but off the subject a bit are the 14mile numbers of these cars my first new car was a 1969 pontiac gto with a 400cid engine and i forget the hp rating it might have been 350hp but horsepower was rated a lot more optimistically in those days anyway i took it to the drag strip a number of times and ran in the pure stock category which meant street tires and no engine mods the tires in those days were 14 bias ply tires and very skinny by todays standards i won my class a couple of times running 143 seconds  100mph the one time that i tried the car with a pair of cheater slicks on the back it went through at 139 seconds anyway i am surprised in a way that todays performance cars are not all that much quicker in the quarter mile of course dont even start comparing ride  handling with those old beasts live axles leaf springs drum brakes etc some of the 60s muscle cars probably didnt weigh any more in some cases less than a new compact like the is which runs about 3500 right traction was another big limiting facotr but that showed up more in 060 or et than in trap speed at least the is will give you a bit better mpg than the old goat i am new to the luxury market and am considering the bmw 325 in an i or xi package and am also considering an infiniti g35 first on the bmw i live in mn and on a hill do i really need the xi or can i get by with a good set of winter tires ive heard differing opinions on this but would like to save the  and performance of the i if i can second i drove the g35 and was impressed in its relatively much stronger engine and overall value proposition i would be interested in hearing opinions from those of you out there who are more in the know i heard the same thing but only cds initial eval of the car and lexus seem to be able to get any numbers in the low 5s all other car mags that have tested the is seem to be getting in the mid and more likely upper 5s however i suspect that once a stick comes into the picture you may well see some low 5s seems like you have to decide first what you want with bmw you are definitely paying for the name and less performance in comparison to the g35 with the g35 are you looking at the awd version or only the rwd in either configuration it seems the g35 would be the better performer audi a4 20t would be another vehicle to consider if you want awd and comparable performance to the bimmer but i still think the g35 would outperform the audi however the audi does have significantly more tuning potential compared to either car being that it is turbocharged if you are into that kinda thing  other things to consider are warranteies both audi and bmw include all service in their warranties whereas infiniti does not it may be something to factor into the price  do you mind paying more up front for 34 years of expense free driving or not then of course you get into talking about reliability and ill let you do the research on edmunds to come to your own conclusion about that good luck however i suspect that once a stick comes into the picture you may well see some low 5s ummm what do you know that the rest of us dont last i heard the is350 was definitely not going to get a manual gearbox yes no best regards\\nshipo lexus has expressly stated that the 3 series bimmer was their target with this car they can not state that they have a bimmer killer with a conventional auto tranny  unless its a dsgsmgtype setup maybe they will have to put a stick into it im beting one to two years max anyway they said the original is300 was going to be an autoonly setup when they first released it also take what lexusianyoneonthisboard says with a grain of salt lexus has expressly stated that the 3 series bimmer was their target with this car they can not state that they have a bimmer killer with a conventional auto tranny so one would think i too remember early on when the folks at lexus stated that this new is would be a direct competitor to the 3series or some such language however everything that ive read over the last several months including stuff from lexus executives seems to indicate that they are backing off of that stance at this point i for one would be very surprised to see a new is350 with a true three pedal stick shift although a dsg type of tranny is i suppose not out of question best regards\\nshipo the is350 is a competitor to the tl and mb c class its not on the same level as a g or 3 series lexus has expressly stated that the 3 series bimmer was their target with this car yes i believe bmw is their target but i am not convinced lexus understands what a bmw is it doesnt matter what you or lexus thinks a bmw is it matters what lexus shoppers think it is or want it to be plenty of people think they want a bmw but dont really like the experience when they get it plenty of people think they want a bmw but dont really like the experience when they get it hmm ive heard of people getting porsches and sports cars and not liking them but never anyone buying a bmw and not liking it unless it gave them service headaches as far as the ride i think most people who buy them love them by nature of the is size i think there was more room to forsake some of the luxury formula for more sport especially with the back seat sized the way it is actually i think the is could be a new class of car a 222 whats the last 2 the back doors  plenty of people think they want a bmw but dont really like the experience when they get it ive never heard of a bmw owner that truly dislikes their experience i know and have talked with a ton of bmw owners and there are a few that might be a bit disappointed with their particular cars service record yet they still say but i love the car then of course there are the others that love the car and have no problems either most bmw owners love the drive so much that those that have any service headaches dont mind enough for it to affect their overall ownership experience i was really referring to the subset that bought it because it was cool or trendy or whatever than decided that it was too noisyfirm rideheavy steeringwhatever the same ones that could really care less about the whole driving experience but probably do like the acceleration thatd be me my bmws been a nightmare for service but its so darned much fun ill forgive it the is350 could be impeccably reliable and id still hate it every day for lacking any character or fun plenty of people think they want a bmw but dont really like the experience when they get it\\nill tell you whati have a 9 year old e39 bmw 528 5spd with more than 132k miles on the clock and have been shopping for a new lps for the past six months i instantly ruled out another 5 series because i hate bangles styling i have tested the sts rl cts e350 a6 gs and m guess what none of them is better than my old 528 none of them yes they have some new technology bits but as far as ride performance quietness solid construction reliability handling gas mileage roominess whatever they all have significant shortfalls yes some are better in one area or the other but overall none have the full set of attributes that my older car does in my opinion one thing is very clear bmw builds the very best road cars on the planet no one else is close for second place some may accelerate better have fancier interiors whatever but bmw owns the road because or mr bangles styling i may not replace my 97 e39 with another bmw but then i may just keep what i have bmw owners may complain about this or that but you wont find many complaining about how their cars drive how about replacing it with a low mileage 2003 e39 the last year of that platform mine has been faultless and as you have attested has been a pleasure to drive sp is the only way to go  well a better way to go yes i believe bmw is their target but i am not convinced lexus understands what a bmw is i can not agree with this statement more mistakes imo lexus has made with regard to their pursuit of bmw with regard to sportinessperformance awd is a great sporting application it offers great traction in all weather conditions however awd systems cause high amounts of drive line power loss  why would you only combine an awd system with your lower horsepower engine this is not consistent with a goal of producing a sportyperformance vehicle btw they did the same thing with the new gs manual transmissions have always been associated with sportingperformance applications again why would you only offer a mt with your lower hp engine again this is not consistent with a goal of producing a sportyperformance vehicle at least i have to commend them on making the vehicle rwd acura is still trying to make sporty fwd vehicles to compare with bmw though they do a fairly decent job of it now for my bias you rarely see a japanese made vehicle outperform a comparable german made vehicle in any comparison infiniti seems to be the rare exception to the rule now for my bias you rarely see a japanese made vehicle outperform a comparable german made vehicle in any comparison you said it its a very biased statement the whole statement hinges on your defnition of outperform and comparable there are plenty japanese cars that out accelearate and outhandle german cars in the same size segment ultimately choosing a car is a balancing act among four things size sportiness accelearation and handling and luxury content all three balanced against cost german car makers historically have endeared itself to car rags by cheating on three out of four categories fielding a car that was substantially smaller than compeition 3 vs tl g es etc with less luxury content and interior plus at higher cost three out of four compromises made any wonder it would win in the fourth category scientificly there are two ways of defining whats comaprable either by size or by cost the germans loses almost every time if either objective measures is held constant for comparison tl and g beats 5 e and a6 on handling quite easily if size is the criterium for comparable tl and g beat 325 c230 and a4 1820 handily if price is the criterium for comparable it is only when one relaxes standards and bias the comparable in favor of the germans that they would win compros any wonder in the rigged result if you are willing to spend moreny more on a smaller car with less luxury chances are indeed good that you will get better handling unless the mfr is utterly incompetent if you are willing to spend moreny more on a smaller car with less luxury chances are indeed good that you will get better handling as long as the size of the car is big enough for the target market it doesnt matter that the e90 is smaller than the is theyre both big enough personally i think the g35 is too big  more of a midsize car pretending very well mind you to be compact luxury is more than just feature content luxury in large part is qualified by the feel of an automobile how refined is the drivetrain how quiet is the interior how solid is the body structure how well does the suspension absorb impacts andor transmit them to the cockpit how do the doors feelsound when you shut them what do the plastics lookfeel like how smoothly do the controls operate an e90 with vinyl seats and halogen headlights may be lacking some features one expects to have in an entrylevel luxury car but it is definitely a luxurious where it really matters it really boils down to individual priorities size amenities handling acceleration refinement all of these cars offer a different mix of them heres the thing though the japanese mfrs are theoretically just as competent to make a great performing small or medium sized sedan as the germans are so why do they not make direct competition for the germans as you said the 3 series is quite a bit smaller than the tl g es i cant believe you even mentioned the es  what car has that thing ever out performed so why not compete directly with them the tsx is similar in size to the 3 series but acura gives it a relatively weak engine makes it fwd and what do you expect it doesnt compete with regard to the tl and g which 5 e or a6 will they beat with regards to performance thats another imo problem with japanese mfrs  they give you limited choices you can get an a6 32 a6 42 s6 soon or rs6 in a few years and similar options exist with bmw and mb will the tl out perform all of them obviously not you dont have to be that biased or at all to see that in regards to handlingperformance and i dont just mean straight line german cars generally out perform comparable japanese cars  imho of course  dont take this as a personal assault i like japanese cars and would readily buy one but it has to perform and in the cars ive compared they generally havent kept up a bewildered lexus salesman watched as i adjusted the front seat on the is250 to my liking and then hopped in the back to take photos some on edmunds forums are saying a 6 foot man fits just fine in the back of the new is perhaps its my physical limitations but i found the back of the is250350 uninhabitable visavis even the uncomfortable e46 i own i am only 57 145 lbs and i could not get my legs into the foot area and place my bottom comfortably on the seat at the same time my pics is250350 backseat  notice my legs are cocked and my right knee is within an inch or so of the front seat im only 57 so the drivers seat isnt that far back  backseat of my 330i  notice i have at least 45 inches between my knees and the back of the drivers seat and you can even see some of the seat cushion  my feet in the foot area of the is250350  theyre smashed together my shins are painfully crushed against the back of the drivers seat and my back is flush to the backseat note you can barely see a bit of the seat cushion  my feet in the foot area of the e46 330i  notice my feet are apart and at most the lower edge of chair touches my shin my knees are also not even bent at 90 degrees  is this scientific no will it be true for all no but to my experience with the seat in the is250350 in a comfortable driving position i can not even come close to sitting semicomfortably in the back of the is the chinese were into foot binding for over 1000 years maybe japanese engineers in the 21st century have a thing for leg binding btw that salesguy at the lexus dealer was totally perplexed dont you want to drive it no thanks drove it already dont like it too soft sure youll sell tons of them though blueguy i do know a good chiropractorseems you may need it after sitting behind the is you can get an a6 32 a6 42 s6 soon or rs6 in a few years and similar options exist with bmw and mb will the tl out perform all of them obviously not you dont have to be that biased or at all to see that in regards to handlingperformance and i dont just mean straight line german cars generally out perform comparable japanese cars  imho of course once again it hinges on your definition of comparable rs6 is a 7080k car are you seriously comparing that to a 30k japanese car and call yourself unbiased what you call options in the forms of s6 and rs6 are nothing more than a waste of money for the overwhelming majority of buyers of a6 the sales of s4rs4 and s6rs6 combined dont even make up 10 of their a4a6 volume and can never get their rd money back what you call options are really the elimination of the very practical option of being able to get the a4 or a6 at an otherwise lower price and the even more critically important option of getting an a4 or a6 that is reliable the plethra of nonstandardization is the big reason behind german unreliability and high cost i cant believe you even mentioned the es  what car has that thing ever out performed btw the es out performed 318s of its time quite well in typical american street and highway driving conditions it certainly did better than the a6 28 quatro that could not even get out of its own way and accounted for the overwhelming majority of a6 sales for a long time the is350 is a competitor to the tl and mb c class its not on the same level as a g or 3 series my 45k says otherwise the tl and c are long off my shopping list is g and 3 are the only contenders left competing for my money prefer a folding top both is and 3 are making one one can only assume g is to follow suit soon i too live in mn on a hill we bought the g35x in july to replace the front wheel drive passat so far the g has been a treat cant say i looked very closely at the bmw but odds are in your favor for lack of mechanical issues with the g if that factors into the decsion say i looked very closely at the bmw but odds are in your favor for lack of mechanical issues with the g if that factors into the decsion mechanical issues with the 325xi what mecanical issues are you referring to i did not know there were mechanical issues nice legs dude could you have at least worn shorts for the photoop i am surprised that the jag didnt get much exposure when people discussed the entry level luxury sport sedan the price falls well within the entry level moniker 30k it is definitely luxurious with a great reputation in us and abroad one may argue the sportiness of the car however with an option 30l v6 making 230 hp standard awd and a manual transmission it has all the right ingredients to at least warrant an honorable mention stop the harrassment that this is a ford if you have driven one you will agree that this car is every bit a well appointed luxury sport sedan i have driven an xtype its an afterthought in that group of saabs volvos and caddys part of the problem is the chassis which is an old mondeo i think the real problem with the jag is that it distinguishes itself in no category whatsoever its a total alsoran i wanted to like it in the worst way when it was introduced but oy its a stretch i think the modeo platform was a winner for what it was the competition is just way ahead now yeah bg nice gams the awd system is very slow reacting there is an excessive amount of body roll some of the interior materials are questionable and the v6 is straight outta dearborn duratec not to mention the price besides the factory backed leases as of late the stickers on these cars are well into ill take a 3 series for that kind of dough range personally it would be the last car on a long list of competitors in the entry level sport sedan category think the real problem with the jag is that it distinguishes itself in no category whatsoever except for the jaguar xke unfortunately that was far too many decades ago is and 3s are about the same size and we further agree that g35 is significantly larger than both whether it is too big is an entirely subjective matter within each companys lineup however the bigger car almost always commands higher price premium and delivers less sportiness eg is vs gs vs ls and 3 vs 5 vs 7 thats exactly the point that i was making historically bmw had been selling smaller cars at high price on sportiness suppose company i made an exact copy of the 5 series and company l made an exact copy of 7 series and both companies sell them for 33k many rags and bmw fans would still claim that bmws are better the g35 came pretty damn close to the hypothetical copy of 5 series german car makers historically have endeared itself to car rags by cheating on three out of four categories fielding a car that was substantially smaller than compeition 3 vs tl g es etc with less luxury content and interior plus at higher cost thats pretty funny considering germans created the segment bmw in particular and the japanese are the new comers to the segment suppose company i made an exact copy of the 5 series and company l made an exact copy of 7 series and both companies sell them for 33k many rags and bmw fans would still claim that bmws are better that is a bit of a stretch\\nsort of like the movie invasion of the body snatchers although a snatched body is identical to the body it replaces the distinct character differnces between these two bodies remains distinct the same applies to your company l theory although hp and other stats of company l may resemble or even exceed an equivalent bmw there remains a distinct differerence in the character and feel of driving a bmw unrelated topic best version of the invasion of the body snatchers was directed by philip kaufman and filmed in 1978 with donald sutherland and jeff goldblum thats pretty funny considering germans created the segment bmw in particular and the japanese are the new comers to the segment sedan market existed long before bmw made 2002 the predecessor of 3 series the very concept of bmw sportsedan has been fielding a smaller sedan giving it better handling and charge the price of a bigger sedan in other words a bmw 5 series with badge replaced would have lost its soul    interesting theory probably a precise characterization of the typical bmw fans state of mind please notice the hypothesis was on cars that are actually identical not just hp and stats just lower price hence enabling a comparison to the 3 series on price point one has to conclude that the very high price itself must be what makes the soul  a little like crystals jewelry  the more one overpays the better the product must be or maybe its the roadfeel and the atthelimit handling the g35 still cant match btw what does the m3545 compete with then if you honestly think bmws are like overpriced crystal jewelery then that is fine with me but i can assure you that you will feel exasperation when those auto mags continue picking bmw as a number one choice your simple crystal jewelery theory will fail to explain auto mag choices why not just forget auto rags and your theories just go out there and do your own test drive comparisons my brotherinlaw test drove a infiniti g35 a bmw330i and a lexus es 330 he chose a es330 and thinks i am nuts in trying to persuade him that a infiniti g35 or bmw330i are more exciting cars to each his own sedan market existed long before bmw made 2002 the predecessor of 3 series true but were talking about entrylevel luxury performance sedans on this forum by most accounts that started with 3 series 2002s were very spartan or maybe its the roadfeel and the atthelimit handling the g35 still cant match match what g35 have long surpassed the 5 series in roadfeel is that a german word just kidding  and atthelimit handling btw what does the m3545 compete with then in price it competes against 5 series but in size once again half a size bigger or slightly less than that also notice the difference in wheel base among g m and q is only a couple inches 112  114 whereas the difference among the bmws is quite wide from 108 all the way to 117 with 5 smack in the 113 closest to g m and q match what g35 have long surpassed the 5 series in roadfeel is that a german word just kidding and atthelimit handling huh huh 5 series is actually a very staid car compared to 3 series and g35 true but were talking about entrylevel luxury performance sedans on this forum by most accounts that started with 3 series 2002s were very spartan so did entrylevel luxury performance sedan market exist or not before the 3 series didnt bmw have to steal sedan market buyers for its 3 series thats the point i have been making bmw wins points by charging premium for a small sedan that naturally outhandles much bigger competitions at the same price point which one has cd of 03 and which one has 028 mpg which one has 2129 and which one has 2432 that is a 15 engineering handicap why cant bmw just copy a lexus is it really that hard to make a copy with those over flow of german engineers that is so hard to lay off come on 15 is this the best we can get after that 7 long years match what g35 have long surpassed the 5 series in roadfeel is that a german word just kidding and atthelimit handling maybe on your planet the g35 in my time with it was a fun car but its nvh was unbearable the tranny notchy and the cars handling was skittish especially when pushedthe fm platform has a nasty proclivity for snap oversteer of course this is just my experience driving manual versions and my friends automatic since you appear not to have any issues wrt expressing your overimaginative opinions regarding these cars allow me to express mine you might be among the very few people on the planet to arive at the conclusion that the 5series is very staid coupled with your offthecharts opinions in general allow me say that you that you are coming at this from someplace ive never heard of p some humans are actually larger than the average hobbit so no performance car will do if it is impossible to drive comfortably that said the 5series sedans and estates continue to set the bar from a total balance performance perspective your comments are simply out there on their own and do not offer an intelligent counterpoint to the relative performance merits of bmw and infiniti trust me if you and i were to show up at road atlanta in our respective autos id give myself a better than even chance to out run you over a 10lap circuit you can drive the g35 or your saab and ill drive my little 03 530sp and the issue of being staid will most likely be laid to rest thats the point i have been making bmw wins points by charging premium for a small sedan that naturally outhandles much bigger competitions at the same price point so your point is a smaller car will naturally outhandle a bigger car everything else being equal so a civic can outhandle a 550 which one has cd of 03 and which one has 028 mpg which one has 2129 and which one has 2432 lol i am so impressed it just makes me want to jump right out of my seat and place an order for that potent agile and highperformance king called the lexus is250 p regarding mpg did you compare a manual is250 to a manual bmw325i contrary to your example above the manual bmw has a bit of an edge over the manual is250 in terms of mpg but i dont think bmw engineers are too concerned about mpg for a 325i when they have fuel miser turbodiesel versions of the e90 bmw intends to sell diesels to our continent in a few years the g35 in my time with it was a fun car but its nvh was unbearable the tranny notchy and the cars handling was skittish especially when pushedthe fm platform has a nasty proclivity for snap oversteer wheres your sense of adventure  what you have described is the soul of a 911 in case you did not notice served up in smaller portions so your point is a smaller car will naturally outhandle a bigger car everything else being equal so a civic can outhandle a 550 not sure where you are getting your strawman a ferrari 550 cost 15 times as much as a civic and a bmw 550i costs nearly 5 times as much if thats what it takes to beat the lowly civic    on the other hand when cost are anywhere within shouting distance a 550i certainly lags a 330i in the handling department lps  luxury performance sedans what bgdc described has absolutely nothing in common with or to do with a 911 the more thoughts you express here the more you make my prior point of coming at this from an unknown place a g35 has the soul of a 911 served up in smaller portions rich my man rich you are making the vain attempt to compare the larger and smaller platforms also in the spirit of this discussion 550 can only refer to the 5series sedan you believe is an underperformer guess everyone is entitled to their opinion and yours are abolutely thoughtprovoking in case you did not know the skittishness ie the readiness to swap the front and back ends has been the hallmark of 911s fun handling for decades to a lesser degree that oversteer tendancy is also what makes rwd more fun and sporty v8 5 series has been described to be the lesser in handling compared to the v6 brethrens for years 5 series being a lesser handler compared to the 3 series is not only well known but also reflected in the scca rule book 5 series is a whole class or two below the 3 series of comparable vintage 330i is way ahead of the nonm 5 series v8 5 series has been described to be the lesser in handling compared to the v6 brethrens for years ummm last time i checked bmw was not in the business of producing v6 engines the only six pot engines that they produce are of the inline six or i6 configuration and to the best of my knowledge they have never produced a single v6 engine for a production car best regards\\nshipo whew finally we agree an is350 will outhandle a gs430 a 330i will outhandle a 5 series a g35 will outhandle an m45 an s2000 will outhandle an rl so back to your original point they invented the market by taking a small sedan and making it fun to drive and then along comes the competitors making bigger cars and the e46 gets dinged but now the shoe is on the other foot as the 330i is bigger than the is350 and can still outhandle it the disparity in hp is only temporary as bmw is working on its version of the 35l twinturbo engin so did entrylevel luxury performance sedan market exist or not before the 3 series no bmw created that market bmw wins points by charging premium for a small sedan that naturally outhandles much bigger competitions at the same price point the flaw in your arguement is that bmw isnt building a small car its the competitions mostly japanese thats building a big cars i dont know if this will contribute anything to the discussion but i believe car and driver did a brief comparo between an m3 ctsv and m5 not the new one a few months back as i remember they ranked the cars from most sportiest m3 ctsv and then m5 it does seem that smaller size and weight in most cases tends to give you the advantage in agility and maneuverability handling when everything else drivetrain dynamics suspension are comparable personally i wouldnt bet a 530sp against a g35 wsport against a saab of course yeahall you would get with the saab would be a car with 250 hp258 lbft of torque90 available from 1800 rpm and upa double best pick crash test rating\\nevery available option except navigation36months of paid maintenance and the car barely breaks 35000 msrp yeahall you would get with the saab would be a car with 250 hp258 lbft of torque90 available from 1800 rpm and upa double best pick crash test rating every available option and no bluetooth and no awd best regards\\nshipo for 800 bucks i buy a set of snowms rated tires on nice looking alloy wheels from my saab dealers parts deptand with the 7 grand grand left over i can buy the most expensive after market blue tooth setup known to man and still take a 3 week vacation in aruba1 hmmm 7000 left over compared to what a 330i yup 7000 as close to apples to apples as possible for a car that will flat embarras a 93 aero in any performance category then again there is the g35 a price difference of 7000 there nope more like 1000 as close to apples to apples as possible of course while the g35 apparently cannot get around a race track as fast as the 330i can it can still handily destroy the aforementioned 93 aero in that same environment the saab is a competent car i drove one last week but it aint no performance oriented rwd sedan and it doesnt drive like one either me ill spend that 7000 and figure that the three years of smiles on my face was well worth not going to aruba for three weeks  best regards\\nshipo hi i am torn between getting a c55 m3 ctsv and 550i\\ncan you please tell me in what order which is best and which is worst are you sure you made that post in the correct discussion if you are are you prepared for lots of conflicting answers and potentially heated disucssion personally id rank them as follows bmw 550i 6speed\\nbmw m3 6speed not a sedan by the way\\nmercedesbenz c55\\ncadillac ctsv best regards\\nshipo not a bad dilemma to have but it seems there are three classes of autos there the m3 being the true blue sports car coupe the c55 a step up towards family life and the bigger road wreckers blingin in as the 550 and ctsv theres something awfully tempting about a beemer being called a 550 i suppose it reminds me of something i know i146ll never have from italy of course ive always wanted an m3 too drive them and decide for yourself it looks like youre more interested in sport and speed based on your selections the 550i is definitely the most expensive of the bunch once you pile on the options even before you add any options the most sporting of the bunch will be the m3 and ctsv it would probably be a tossup between the c55 and 550i nonsport on which is the least sporting the 550i is decidedly larger than the others the c55 cant be had with a manual all the others can the ctsv is manual only if you want a fast highway cruiser for you and guests that wont beat you up on the rough roads but wont let you down when the road gets twisty 550i all the way if you want hardcore performance all the time and want to be able to get the kids scared straight in the twisties ctsv will do nicely if you want all out ballstothewall performance for you and a mate and you dont mind your body taking a little beating on the city streets the m3 will work if you want to blaze down the freeway as hard as you can and dont mind slowing down a bit for the occasional bend in the road the c55 will suit by process of elimination the m3 is the only coupe in the bunch so out with that the 550i is much bigger than the others so out it goes by mentioning the m3 you showed that you are more on the sport side of the spectrum and mentioning the 550i showed that you probably have passengers to haul from time to time both of those eliminate the c55 and that just leaves the ctsv get the ctsv hi i am torn between getting a c55 m3 ctsv and 550i\\ncan you please tell me in what order which is best and which is worst you need to define whats best and worst are you talking about overall performance straight line acceleration luxury and this means what on the road race course the readiness to swap the front and back ends is called oversteer not skittishness to me skittishness is from uncontrolled body motions due to a less than ideal suspension setup controlled oversteer is indeed fun on the road course skittishness is not a 911 and its rear engine layout has nothing in common with these cars from a handling persperctive most of the severe oversteer tendencies of the 911 went away several platform generations ago anyway granted a lesser skilled driver in a 997 today could drive around a road course more easily today than heshe could in a pre993 911 todays rwd cars  at least the ones we are discussing in this forum  are all competent some moreso than others the 3series bmw offers the finest driving experience in its class imo that is not to say the is and g are incompetent  far from it the little things add up over the course of a road race and i believe the 330 shines when taking this into account the daytoday driving experience evens the field to a certain degree and that is the world that contributes to the perspective taken by many drivers of these autos some just like knowing they have a superior driving machine some prefer creature comforts some are driven by their own sense of styling etc there is something for everyone in this class this is just my opinion if i have the money i would either buy a c55 amg or an m3 because to me those cars are sportluxury to me the 550 is just luxury this doesnt mean it doesnt perform im just saying i look at it as just a luxury car i wouldnt get the ctsv simply because i dont like american cars some of them look nice but i wouldnt spend money on any domestic car so if i were faced with that question i would only be choosing between an m3 or c55 but then again i prefer more sport than luxury the c55 is off the list immediately  automatic transmission and mb engineering  no way in hell m3  too boy racer for me plus its a coupe blech 550i  last choice great exterior wonderful power manual tranny and its only 5253k through ed with sportpackage alright i have read all of these and agree with you about the america cadillac ctsv so that is out the 550i is too expensive so now it is only between c55 and m3 the c55 is off the list immediately  automatic transmission and mb engineering  no way in hell what is so wrong with mercedesbenz in your eyes im curious dynamics reliability styling what m so now it is only between c55 and m3 test drive both and go with the 1 you like better personally id go with m3 what is so wrong with mercedesbenz in your eyes im curious dynamics reliability styling what yes yes dont care about styling and add in engineering theyre not my kinda company i see them as the european caddy  ie all flash and dazzle no substance yes yes dont care about styling and add in engineering theyre not my kinda company i see them as the european caddy  ie all flash and dazzle no substance perception to each his own i guess thankfully that isnt the case m i recently test drove the mt c230 it is not your grandfathers cadillac it is a very responsive car from a performance point of view it is right up there with the leaders in its price category bmw 3 series acura tl infiniti g35 less hp but great road feel and cabin amenities the ony thing that makes me tend to shy away from it is the tarnished reputation of mb generally for reliability was it the 2006 c230 with the v6 m no it was the 05 with the 4 cylinder supercharger it was impressive for a 4 cylinder but not quite strong enough to match the big boys i understand that the v6 is better so i will go back and try the 06 within the next week ill post my experience i recently test drove the mt c230 it is not your grandfathers cadillac it is a very responsive car from a performance point of view it is right up there with the leaders in its price category bmw 3 series acura tl infiniti g35 wife and i test drove a 04 c230 with auto transmission and i didnt think much of it it was better than tl just about anything is but not in the same league as bmw for the money id prefer if the wife chooses a3 about a year ago i test drove a couple of c230s one of each type of transmission the two cars were worlds apart the at seemed sluggish and had a noticeable lag coming off the line the mt on the other hand felt quick and responsive and had no perceptible lag from the start the mts supercharged i4 was indistinguishable from a larger displacement normally aspirated i6 loved the feel of the shifter too its wifes car so it has to be automatic for the money  fun factor i prefer a3 vs c230 but its ultimately her car so she gets to pick the upcoming month of april will be the day the new reskinned g35 will debut at the new york auto show not much in terms of details in the article below 2007 g40 g30 30l vq w 250 hp 30000 g40 38l vq w 320 hp 34000 g50 48l vk w 380 hp 40000 better interior and 6 speed auto transmission is a given and please keep the weight down me want also now only if they can keep the gas mileage out of the single digits dave are you really serious about a c230 been better than a tl or are you just displaying ignorance here you gotta be kidding me not even the c320 comes close to a tl in any category whatsoever my current car which is the previous generation tl type s will run circles around both of these cars now if you had said the c55 amg i will strongly agree with you\\nplease do not mention the c320 and c230 in the same breath with the tl dave are you really serious about a c230 been better than a tl or are you just displaying ignorance here i havent driven the new ones but wife owns a 00 32 tl and mom owns a 01 32 tl they accelerate from stop reasonably well but if youre crusing at 6070 mph and want to pass youll need to wait a sec for the car to respond their handling is average at best take a 25 mph onoff ramp at 3035 and you get all sort of body roll and tire squeal their braking is average at also i need to brake quite a bit early vs my car or i overshoot my turn they are good at taking you from point a to point b in comfort but not much fun im not going to insist that the c230 is a better car but since the tl is fwd and the c230 isnt id take the merc over the tl but thats just me you must loathe driving your wifes car sorry billy but i have to pile on here i have extensively test driven the 32 s and the new tl and they both feel ponderous yes they roar off the stoplight but i dont tend to gun it from a standstill in the curves any german sedan including a jetta is a much more fun car than a tl i just drove a new bottom of the line c240 and while supposedly lousy compared to the c230 it was much tighter than the tls i drove i tried to like the tl as i like honda for many reasons and i love the tsx as it is very tossable and fun but the tl sporty nah just got delivery of the 7speed automatic 2006 c350 luxury ordered early sept man i am zapped like never before its all power and silken smoothness  the interior looks very refined  much better than the bmw 3series and i already hate to let the kids in raced to 100mph effortlessly without any noise increasethere is a very solid feeling throughout the car easily took some corners at high speeds sharp freeway exits and the steeering feels so light and the car so nimble and stable that i may get into this bad habit uturns has a very short radius and feels nicethe standard alloy wheels also look so great i decided against chromehave yet to try the touchshift manual i bought it loaded with most options\\nlightingxenon

warmers i have a question though for the informed pundits on this forum  is it ok to push the car to its limits speed acceleration etc in the initial breakin period or should i ease up what identifiers show you have a harmon kardon system the only indicator i have found on mine is one logo on the left rear speaker and the invoice there is no indicator in the radio or any other speakers i get no sound in the back im trying to figure out if they put in the wrong tuner or just had a bad wiring job it will go in for repair soon as you said the left rear speaker has the name on it plus in the sound settings there is an option for logic7 system other settings are speech standard default about your rear sound problem are you sure the balancefade setting is correct lucky you i ordered mine on 92905 they dont plan to build it until the middle of december i am almost pissed off enough to head over to the lexus dealer is it ok to push the car to its limits speed acceleration etc in the initial breakin period my advice consult your owners manual and follow their recommendations i know its like waiting for xmas but i know you can do it of course the moment you get past the breakin period test the revlimiter for what its worth i caved in and traded my 2000 bmw 328i for the new is 250 awd i was just not satisfied with the 3series offered and could not justify the price difference for what its worth i caved in and traded my 2000 bmw 328i for the new is 250 awd i was just not satisfied with the 3series offered and could not justify the price differencei im guessing you mean an 06 325xi v the is250 awd to each his own you must loathe driving your wifes car tl isnt a bad car its a very comfortable car i just dont consider it a performance sedan i end up driving it a lot on the weekends because my wife hates riding in my car my sentiments exactly my best friends wife drives a tl he loves how quiet and smooth and conforatble it is he would also trade it back for his sisters 02 325ia sp turned back in on a lease in a heartbeat his sister got a g35x and after 6 months admits missing her bmw its funny i used to think my 330i sp was sporty and lots of fun but once i started driving m coupe i found the 330i soft and boring this is what another guy said the information on a japanese car magazine is introduced\\nthe next g carries new v6 engine fz probably it is called fz37 37liter 320330hp \\nit is reported that a this turbo version is carried in next gtr\\na new style platform is used at the next g this is reported for the front section to consist of aluminum i think dude is in japan personally im a bit skeptical about this new engine there is no mention of it in the us press at all but the vq engine is going on 12 years old so maybe the change is warranted anyways aluminum and weight savings is always welcome in a sport sedan if true 320 hp v6 6mt aluminum body 33000   where do i sign up i certainly wouldnt bet on 33k well either way we know infiniti isnt going to let lexus keep that hp advantage for long id expect them to undercut lexus in price too m the detroit newss auto section yesterday had a comparison test between the 330i and is350 it was done by paul  anita leinert  maybe they are syndicated in other papers after rating the cars in several categories they gave the win to the bmw saying that although lexus is aiming at the 3series the 3series presents a moving target and has improved with the new e90 the only category where the is350 was a clear winner was the drivetrain as they liked the added power and also the transmission they compared automatics only one interesting comment was that they thought the is350s interior was cold and teutonic where the 330is was more warm and inviting so hows that for a turnabout lexus overgermanized their car p they also gave the bmw extra points for features like rainsensing wipers adaptive headlights and taillights etc of course a car comparison test that takes up just a few inches of newspaper column space is not very comprehensive but i thought that their evaluation adds fuel to the fire cant decide between tl and g35awdboth have points to consideri like price point of tl no navversus g35 awd with premium package c g35 is more moneylive in northeastis awd that necessarywhat about possible style change for 2007would hate to buy outdated car knowing big changes are coming wife is not driving enthusiastneed reliability and something sportytl complaints of leather seatingvibrationsrattles and horriffic tireshow bad is this car in snowcar sizes are closewarrantiesroadside etc are equali am a buyerwhat about resale value after 5 years of useall ideas are welcomelooking for deal by end of year i am likely to buy a tl in the near future and live in the northeast but fwd has nothing to do with it i currently drive a rwd vehicle with all season tires and get around just fine live in ma near the nh border i wouldnt choose on the basis of awd or tires  they are replacable the tl vibrations and rattles that are mentioned on these boards are unsettling id take that into consideration the tl is less of a racecar and a bit more packed with features it is a close call though i think the tl is a better allaround commuting vehicle if i was driving mostly on windy country roads the g35 might be more appealing awd that necessary thats a question that will get you a lot of varied responses for sure you dont need awd just like you dont really need snow tires people like to point out the number of awd4wd in ditches when it starts snowing and people also like to point out it doesnt help you stop that may be true but its stopping is not the issue when you are stuck in deep drifts and ive seen rwd rwd with snows and fwd stuck over the last several years as well as the same self said vehicles wrapped around telephone poles and run into ditches this is my pecking order of best to leastbest\\n 4wd with low range with or without snows\\n awd with or without snows\\n fwd snows\\n rwd snows\\n fwd\\n rwd good luck with your decision the only other point to consider is the hassle of changing snow tires on the tl vs leaving the allseason tires on the g35x you still have very good traction with the allseason rubber and awd i have driven awd after an 8 snow fall to get home and have found that awd is extremely useful in that situation all cars in my household are now awd as mentioned earlier awd will not help you stop any quicker than fwd i had the exact same decision to make 18 months ago i went with the tl because it has the best mix of performance and luxury the g35x is a bit too small for me and its interiorfeatures are well below the tls the tl performs well enough for me as for the tl quality you hear more on this board about it because people with problems let everybody know about it i and i believe the majority do not have bad problems that being said i do notice a slight vibration on by 04 automatic transmission at around 5055 mph when 5th gear kicks in this is a legitimate problem my dashboard has not faded the leather has stretched a little but it does not look bad lastly if you get the nonnavi tl comes with the horrendous bridgestone el42s you will want to get snow tires i did and it makes a big difference price that and the costs of changing them twice a year into your equation jeff  a happy tl owner shades the only other point to consider is the hassle of changing snow tires on the tl vs leaving the allseason tires on the g35x the other point to consider is the hassle of carrying around few hundred pounds of ballast in the form of awd system weaker suspension system and worse milage hi al boston area resident here tl owner i second what most of the posts after yours have pointed out i chose the tl over the g35x also because in favor of the tl superior interiorexterior style and interior materials\\nsmootherquieter ride\\nnot having the added complexityweight of awd to carry around 365 daysyr\\nbetter mpg\\nand i suppose a few  less expensive although that was not a major factor as i was shopping a broad price range but a factor after almost 11 months no vibrations one rattle but only when the sunroof is in the vent position which the dealer said they fixed at a1 service they did not leather looks fine not brand new but fine dash does seem to have a bit of the discoloration issue but cleaning it helps the tires now thats my biggest complaint they are terrible in the snow and i believe they flat spot i survived last winter but it was a challenge ive always driven fwd into maine new hampster  vermont to ski and in 25 years i probably would have apprecitated awd a few times very few times for me awd is a nicety not a necessity tl with the bridgestones is the first fwd i dont feel totally snowconfident in and its not the car its the tires so overall diggin the tl either is a fine choice tl is more luxurysport g is sportluxury tl will probably be less expensive to operate overall imho good luck keep us posted i made the same decision about a month ago went with the g\\nto me the g35x had enuff luxury but won me over with how it drove i dont think anyone will question that the tl has the much better interior but i felt the g was good enuff and underneath it all was the better car no offense but the tl is a super accord both good and bad it just felt too close to the camry type cars i was trying 2 get out of dont get me wrong if the tl had awd i would have snatched it up in a second but the g just felt better on the road i test drove each one over 4 times so i had a good feel for each car and there are times when i sometimes think i should have gone with the tl esp when im stuck in traffic and the nicer interior with more gadgets would have been nice but as soon as i start moving in the g i know i made the right choice btw for me the tl was more expensive to lease even though it stickers much less than a fully loaded g35x mf and residuals are padded by nissan much more than acura the last thing i was gonna do was give up awd and pay more for the car the other point to consider is the hassle of carrying around few hundred pounds of ballast in the form of awd system weaker suspension system weaker suspension as compared to what surprise i dont know what that means the g35x sits a little higher than the standard rwd g35 but that is so you can go better in deep snow when your 330i or a tl are spinning their wheels because their suspension is too low when your 330i yes but not the 330xi we were not talking about the 330xi i was responding to the comment from dave330i that the g35x had a weaker suspension i was asking him compared to what is it weaker weaker suspension as compared to what g35x has a weaker suspension compaired to g35 awd is marketing at its best or worst since most of the people getting it dont need it the g35x sits a little higher than the standard rwd g35 but that is so you can go better in deep snow when your 330i or a tl are spinning their wheels because their suspension is too low tell me how often are you expecting deep snow each year maybe 1 5 10 or 15 days for those once in a blue moon days youre willing to sacrifice performace the rest of the year it has gotten to the point where i firmly believe anyone disparaging awd has not owned a performance rearwheel biased awd system porsche the worlds most prestigious sports car maker offers awd on their 911and set the world on fire with the awd 959 in 86 the skyline gtr is legendarythe g35xs system is derived from that experience and in case you wonder from what experience i speak i have a top 10 road racing plate hanging on my wall and dislike unnescessary weight as much as the next racer on a road car in most climates in the us awd is a great feature despite the extra weight and has numerous advantages other than just deep snow dave330i awd is actually very useful for driving in snow and ice you dont experience that in sunny ca much but in the northeast or the midwest awd is not a marketing gimmick awd is not just useful in high snow but hilly icy driveways left turns across busy streets you get the idea awd offers a substantial traction advantage for street driving i dont think there is a large advantage from the rwd g35 to the x especially for 90 of the drivers out there if your talking auto cross or track performance then there are advantages to a smaller lighter rwd package calling the standard g35x suspension softer than the sport g35 suspension is a reasonable comparison however i was responding to al57 who is comparing the fwd tl vs the g35 and asking for help with his decsion in snowy regions my opinion is that the awd g35x offers handling advantages over the fwd tl the x is primarily rwd and does not suffer from torque steer like the tl in the end buy what you like not what someone on the internet thinks you should buy it has gotten to the point where i firmly believe anyone disparaging awd has not owned a performance rearwheel biased awd system i wasnt trying to disparage awd system i disagree with people who automatically assume they need awd because it snows on occasion porsche the worlds most prestigious sports car maker offers awd on their 911and set the world on fire with the awd 959 in 86 and yet they only offer gt2  gt3 in rwd only on a road car in most climates in the us awd is a great feature despite the extra weight and has numerous advantages other than just deep snow i believe right tire is a better choice than awd vs rwd vs fwd for most drivers if you can get better performance with awd great i prefer rwd and ill stick with it dave330i awd is actually very useful for driving in snow and ice you dont experience that in sunny ca much but in the northeast or the midwest awd is not a marketing gimmick i lived in northeast until 2000 without awd just fine awd is not just useful in high snow but hilly icy driveways left turns across busy streets you get the idea awd offers a substantial traction advantage again how often will you expericen bad weather even if its 60 days thats still 300 days where rwd will be better than awd for street driving i dont think there is a large advantage from the rwd g35 to the x especially for 90 of the drivers out there if youre interested in a performance sedan you should be able to feel the difference between rwd  awd however i was responding to al57 who is comparing the fwd tl vs the g35 and asking for help with his decsion in snowy regions my opinion is that the awd g35x offers handling advantages over the fwd tl i guess i should have been more clear i was trying to get al57 to consider g35 as an alternative to g35x or tl in the end buy what you like not what someone on the internet thinks you should buy very true i guess i should have been more clear i was trying to get al57 to consider g35 as an alternative to g35x or tl al57 was comparing the rwd g35 to the fwd tl in his post i was suggesting he consider the x sometimes i think we all rush to type an answer with our not so humble opinions before really reading what the question was a very good way to compare fwd tl to the g35x is to drive both especially on snow covered roads this can help you make an educated decision end of my not so humble opinion maybe 1 5 10 or 15 days  to that way of thinking its like saying its hot only 2 months of the year why do i need airconditioning the answer is  if i need it once it already paid for itself i lived in northeast until 2000 without awd just fine i also lived in sunny ca for a brief stint and admitedly awd doesnt have much of an advantage there but in the northeast in the last 10 years i lost track of the number of times i limped along and was concerned about getting stuck in very deep snow with awd getting stuck is no longer a concern unless one does something very very stupid with awd getting stuck is no longer a concern unless one does something very very stupid the same could also be said for any decent car with a good set of winter tires many choose to change the odds by opting for an allseason equiped car with awd some things get better some get worse while others are willing to spend enough to changed the odds even more by opting for awd and winter tires which is best it depends upon where you live how you drive and the conditions that you are willing to drive in consider this three winters ago my california born and raised wife had never driven in snow in a rwd car in her life although she did have a little fwd experience that winter i broke my right leg which prohibited me from driving a car with a manual transmission and as such the situation required us to swap cars i just positioned my casted right leg over in the passengers footwell of her car and drove left footed wouldnt you know it that winter here in southern new hampshire mother nature threw 114 of snow at us forcing her to drive my winter tire shod 530i back and forth to work round trip nearly 70 miles through it all she never got stuck never was unable to make it to work or home in fact she never had a single problem so much so that she threatened to break my other leg when i got out of my cast so that she could keep driving the 5er snow or no snow with that in mind i continually have to ask why when folks insist that they need an awd equipped car because they live in the north east sorry not buying best regards\\nshipo so much so that she threatened to break my other leg when i got out of my cast so that she could keep driving the 5er snow or no snow lol does she have any other reasons to want to keep you hobbling with that in mind i continually have to ask why when folks insist that they need an awd equipped car because they live in the north east sorry not buying agreed as a lifelong new englanderskier fwdallseason tires and a modicum of intelligenceskillexperience when driving in snow not that i reserve my intelligence for the snow or so i believe has kept me going and arriving safe and sound lo these many years a flatlander in the greenwhite mountains of beautiful maine new hampster and vermont awd is a nicety not a necessity but it will never cease to amaze me the number of drivers that believe awd overrules the laws of physics eg subaru outback wagon  snow  excessive speed after having tailgated me and illegally passed  sharp lefthanded curve rte 103 into ludlow vt  subaru firmly planted in a snow bank on the town green i did stop to see if all were ok besides the subie they were and i continued to my destination in my fwd acura without incident i test drive 7 cars recently i am looking at here is how i would rate them 1 acura tl\\n2 lexus is 350\\n3 infiniti g35\\n4 bmw 325i\\n5 cadillac cts\\n6 mercedes c class\\n7 lincoln zephyr neat care to expand on your rating mehod or pros and cons the same could also be said for any decent car with a good set of winter tires we just disagree on this point with rwd with snows or without snows you slip the dsc or whatever kicks in and engine power gets cut if needed if you dont have dsc tailspin with awd4wd depending on the system of course traction gets transferred to the front wheels its simply more secure besides being more secure imo of course i dont want to swap rims and tires absolutely agree no car regardless of how capable is a substitute for the matter between the ears thinking back on an old it help desk industry acronym pebkac problem exists between keyboard and chair i might humbly suggest that we might want to coin a new acronym for drivers that stuff awd and 4wd equipped cars into snowbanks or worse hmmm how about pebsapos problem exists between seat and pedals or steeringwheel best regards\\nshipo we just disagree on this point with rwd with snows or without snows you slip the dsc or whatever kicks in and engine power gets cut if needed if you dont have dsc tailspin well that seems to be a fairly common belief around here however i drove any number of rwd equipped cars through lots of snow in the days before abs dsc tcs or any of the alphabet soup electronic nannies were applied to the generally affordable automobile industry and i never tailspinned errr unintentionally that is  true if you simply mash the throttle without regard to the conditions around you then tailspin is the least of your worries the fact is that there are many millions of drivers whove driven nonnannied rwd cars billions of miles in wintry conditions without even a single tailspin best regards\\nshipo thinking about my last post a little more the only car that ive ever had an unintentional spin in was in my 1979 vw scirocco of course that was on dry pavement and i was pushing a little hard blush best regards\\nshipo 70miles commute on highways dont count for squat because both nh and ma are very diligent about ploughing highways and the ramps are always very well designed i drove 200 miles from boston to nyc more than a decade ago in an old bmw 5 series no dsc or lsd with bald allseason tires in a snow storm    when i stopped for a bathroom break and a sandwich lunch the headlights were buried by the snow on the bumper when i came out i should not have done that except for youthful inexperiencebravado and the snow storm was sudden    still i made it without incident or even much wheel slippage at all simply because the road was very well salted even as the snow coming down rapidly half a decade later when i had to drive in the boonie back country it was an entirely different matter the back roads of the hilly parts of new england most certainly need awd because the local authorities dont plough for days at a time awd is a nicety not a necessity awd is certainly more necessary than either luxury or performance or the sedan part for that matter can we just move on from this religiosity against awd interesting dichotomy you present dave 330i you advocate winter tiresdespite the fact they will need to be on the car from decmarch even in the midwestand have horrible performance in the dry so basically you advocate turning you performance sedan into an econobox for 45 months out of the year instead of awd then you say if youre interested in a performance sedan you should be able to feel the difference between rwd  awd im sorry but this just does not hold up in my experience ever go to a pca or bmw track event ever notice how 80 of the cars out there are dangerous rolling obstacles ever go to an autocross and find 12 the drivers turning in times slower than what i could achieve on my pit scooter these are people who are not only interested in performance but trying to do something to improve theirs and they make up what maybe 3 of drivers of performance cars and these are the people who are going to notice a couple of hundred pounds on the road at a safe 80 of their ability and yet they only offer gt2  gt3 in rwd only in case you did not know gt2 and gt3 are offered in rwd only because the respective race cars are rwd why are the race cars rwd because awd has been banned from these races due to the unfair advantage in other words when awd were allowed the rwd entrants had no realistic hope of winning the races when driving in the snow by myself i want every unfair advantage there is the fact is that there are many millions of drivers whove driven nonnannied rwd cars billions of miles in wintry conditions without even a single tailspin another fact is that hundreds of thousands of old rwd cars have gone off the road or flipped over in snow conditions the success of fwd cars in snow racing in the 50s and 60s and the success and ultimately the banning of awd cars due to their unfair advantage from car races should have made it plenty clear that rwd platform is not ideal when surface traction is limited as much as i love rwd cars i find it perplexing why some other rwd afficienadoes find it necessary to argue against simple physics 70miles commute on highways dont count for squat because both nh and ma are very diligent about ploughing highways youre pretty funny the fact is that not even the best snow removal team in the world can keep up with 18 of snow in 6 hours some hours were as much as 6 that and the fact that we live a fair distance from any major roads meaning that any commute for us requires a fairly long run on a two lane road that winds its way through hill and dale even when the interstate finally does get cleared its usually several hours before the plows get to our neighborhood best regards\\nshipo another fact is that hundreds of thousands of old rwd cars have gone off the road or flipped over in snow conditions  i find myself wondering if fwd and awd cars have fared any better the fact is that if you put a nut behind the wheel regardless of the car the odds are good that said nut is going to find a snow bank sooner or later i find it perplexing why some other rwd afficienadoes find it necessary to argue against simple physics so whos arguing against simple physics not me the fact is that ive driven nearly a million miles over the years in all sorts of 2wd cars through it all the most capable car that ive ever driven in the snow was my 530i when shod with winter tires true some other cars may have been able to do something a little better but for the overall go turn stop envelope that encompasses the winter driving regimen give me a rwd car with a 5050 weight balance and winter tires best regards\\nshipo distance is nowhere nearly as important as slopes just because you can get by without awd dont expect everyone else can as well i lived in ma for over a decade with rwd and allseason tires sometimes very bald did that make it right for me to proclaim that snow tires are not necessary then a move to the hills demonstrated awd and snow tires are both necessities for a lot of people in new england find myself wondering if fwd and awd cars have fared any better the fact is that if you put a nut behind the wheel regardless of the car the odds are good that said nut is going to find a snow bank sooner or later you dont have to wonder about it at all given the same degree of nuttiness rwd goes off the road first followed by fwd followed by awd followed by halftracks you only need to find a point at which you are comfortable somewhere in that spectrum if your choice is rwd thats fine for you just dont go around telling people your rwd car is the best traction device in the world so whos arguing against simple physics not me yes you are every time you argue that rwd is every bit as good as awd for traction either that or you are making nonpoints the fact is that ive driven nearly a million miles over the years in all sorts of 2wd cars so what i can give you one simple stretch of quater mile that your rwd 530i can not passibly make it in fact rwd snow tires or no snow tires is banned from numerous mountain passes across the country you can drive on flat land in dry ground all you want    still does not prove that your rwd is every bit as good as awd when it gets slippery through it all the most capable car that ive ever driven in the snow was my 530i when shod with winter tires capable as defined by what you are obviously trying to change the topic if it is the most capable in the snow that you have ever had then you have not had any real snow cars true some other cars may have been able to do something a little better but for the overall go turn stop envelope that encompasses the winter driving regimen give me a rwd car with a 5050 weight balance and winter tires a 530xi with regular all season tires can probably clean the clock with your 530i in 90 of winter driving conditions where neither awd nor snow tire is strictly necessary yet your car is stuck with snow tires for the remaining 10 or 1 going up slippery hills the difference is so great as to be laughable oh by the way fresh snow is usually not a problem even if 18 in 6hrs like i said i drove down from boston to nyc in a rwd without no dsc or lsd in a snow storm and on nearlybald all season tires while the snow was coming down so fast that a quick lunch break was enough to put enough snow on the bumper to cover up the headlights the drive was actually pretty simple just follow the tracks made the by cars in front me flat highway busy traffic actually makes snow driving a piece of cake even on my bald all season tires its the overnight packed down refrozen stuff on back country hilly roads that is dangerous in my opinion driver skill and common sense are the most important aspects of negotiating the winter stuff a good driver who also plans his time on road will certainly get by splendidly with rwd that said there is no comparison between awd and the rest none is it necessary depends on the buyer for those who are not particularly good drivers i recommend it highly my wife is an active person and i feel much better about her traipsing around in the winter with awd move south we rarely get snow  usually just a 2 day ice storm and everything gets cancelled anyway we dont need awd we need law enforcement on the roads atlanta perimeter speed limit is as fast as you can go before you hit the next bottleneck and the tl feels great  95 mph congratulations on surviving the trip despite your lack of regard for safety even if you dont feel that your life is worth the cost of a set of tires with tread most other drivers on the road would appreciate you stay off the road if you dont have good tires because regardless of you opinion you cannot drive safely without tread mad very true the need is highly dependent on the driver besides skills i would add more importantly the likelihood of having to drive in bad road conditions ie how important is it for you to show up on time regardless snow or sleet no not talking about going to a holiday party but the type of job you have point well taken that trip was made over a decade ago looking back it was pure youthful folly i would never do such a thing again nor do i encourage anyone to try nowadays i drive with awd and plenty treads the mud and snow variety and encourage everyone to do the same if you live in places that are likely to see unploughed snow sitting overnight turning into packed slick surface wife has family in the northeast and doesnt want to move if it were up to me i would long have moved to ca or hi applauseapplause speaking of winter in new hampshire shipo is it supposed to snow by you this wednesday night or thursday im going to my aunt and uncles house in salem nh and am trying to decide if i should have the snows bolted on my prelude or procrastinate and wait a week or 2 heres the thing when one drives an awd vehicle one has to put up with the thing all year long  noseheavy complex maintenance issues additional overall weight reduced steering feel oh and the thing costs more in the first place relative to the otherwise equivalent rwd with an rwd vehicle its necessary to fit appropriate tires for a portion of the year then use skill driving experience and common sense the few or not so few days that the awd people insist all others should stay indoors the nimble feel of an rwd vehicle trumps the idiotresistant awd vehicle every time in my world ymmv partially agree about the handling so i wont rehash porsches performance oriented awd but i am of the mind i can forgo the rwd handling and feel for the safety and security of awd4wd i dont believe that awd require more maintenance i would be more concerned about my sunroof motor blowing out than having maintenance issues with an awd system ymmv cdnpinhead your maintenance for awd is much cheaper than the purchase of dedicated snow tireswheels and the associated twice a year change out of the them every 30k miles you have one additional transfer case to change fluid out not too expensive or time consuming not to sound like a broken record but the rwd biased g35x is a blast to drive on the street auto crossing or on the track you may actually find the 150lb lighter rwd g35 shaves a couple tenths of a second off of your time in the midwest i am more interested in traction and the security of awd not to mention pulling away from you rwd only drivers at every light on snow covered roads heres the thing when one drives an awd vehicle one has to put up with the thing all year long  noseheavy complex maintenance issues additional overall weight reduced steering feel oh and the thing costs more in the first place relative to the otherwise equivalent rwd much of the same can be said of power sunroof power windows power locks airbags performance engines cd player cd changer nav system    etc including back seats are you talking about luxury performance and sedan or someones idealized bare bones race machine even then awd still comes out ahead of rwd so much so that awd has been banned in some races for unfair advantage with an rwd vehicle its necessary to fit appropriate tires for a portion of the year then use skill driving experience and common sense the few or not so few days that the awd people insist all others should stay indoors first of all rwd with best snow tires can never compete against awd with todays allseason tires going up hill on slippery conditions there is simply no contest second of all rwd on snow tires can not begin to compete against awd with all season tires on dry ground on top of it all awd has significant dynamic advantage in rain conditions the nimble feel of an rwd vehicle trumps the idiotresistant awd vehicle every time in my world the only advantage besides the financial one rwd has over awd is the nimble feel if i were getting a roadster that would indeed be my paramount concern some people may indeed prefer small displacement engines that takes a lot of revving to squeeze out power because that is more fun and takes more skill    its strictly personal preference dont apply your set of values to other people who are buying a sedan by definition a compromise vehicle and a luxury performance one at it thats completely untrue about awd cars i own an 05 audi s4 cabriolet and ive had it since midapril it is not any more noseheavy than the acuras ive had before my audis its not very noseheavy at all and it does not have maintenance problems for every bmw that ive played with ive easily blown by and that includes many current m3s it was sort of amusing there was a man with a 330ci convertible who looked very annoyed driving out of a parking lot i was coming out behind him and he was really pushing it i let him stay ahead of me for a while and then with no effort passed him without sport mode at the light he stared at me with wide eyes it happens a lot and again for maintenance problems the only problem ive had is a faulty air conditioner when i bought the car they gave me a pontiac grand prix and were so embarrased by the mix of crappy rental and bad ac that they gave me a free set of 17s for the winter fellow postersthanks for the great response to my original postseems like we all have our ideas of awd fwd and rwd and how we drive and handle our cars in a given situationthe decision of tl vs g35x is still to tough nowcan we discuss possible large scale changes on g35 for 2007and has anyone bought a non nav tl and negoiated to get the michelin tires installed and how much and how do you price out the difference and are 17 tires just bad in the snowperiod my 2000 maxima se with 17 tires is terriblebut changed to yokohama this year but no snow yet to test it outby the way in northeast dealers have mostly g35x in inventorycan order a regular g35 but would it be considered a white elephant in this market the final decision may be for me be the actual driving experience and feelbottom line and possible better financing terms by year end for either caris this crazy cannot speak much to the 07 g other than rumors of 330 hp motor no real info exsists that im aware of i would thought you had driven these vehicles already by all means drive them and see which one feels best they sell both rwd and awd g35 cars in mn so i dont know why rwd would be a white elephant in the north east if there are remaining 2005 cars you will get the best price on one of those with an rwd vehicle its necessary to fit appropriate tires for a portion of the year then use skill driving experience and common sense the few or not so few days that the awd people insist all others should stay indoors the nimble feel of an rwd vehicle trumps the idiotresistant awd vehicle every time in my world completely agree  i live in toronto and for seven years i love driving my rwd 99 bmw 3 series twelve months a year i have never ever owned snow tires and still find driving rwd manageable with the exception of about two blizzard days a year during those days i just walk a short distance to the subway and go to work not exactly a great inconvenience a couple of years ago one of the car mags did a study comparing four similar cars when driving in slippery conditions iirc the cars were two e320s one rwd and one awd and two a6s one fwd and one awd and for each car they had three sets of tires summer winter and allseason not surprisingly the winter tire equipped awd cars fared the best in all but braking and some of the handling scenarios however much of their focus was comparing allseason awd cars against their 2wd winter tire equipped siblings hmmm seems fairly germane to this latest thread funny thing though contrary to some recent protestations the only category that the allseason awd cars won was acceleration the winter tire equipped e320 won every other category some of them quite handily i might add the fact is that a winter tire equipped rwd sedan with a near 5050 weight balance will easily out drive an otherwise identical allseason equipped awd car like it or dont im only the messenger in this case as far as some of the comments regarding how bad a winter tire shod car will drive on dry roads well im thinking that given the quality of some of the high performance winter tires that have been available for several years now that that statement is a bit disingenuous all of the noise to the contrary winter tires like the h rated michelin pilot alpin pa2s will easily outperform the typical oem allseason tire on dry roads tires such as the continental contitouringcontact or michelin energy mxv4 plus best regards\\nshipo i know im a bit late into this thread but let me say this from my own recent personal experience i had a 98 audi a4 quattro and now have a 04 325i both had stock allseason tires in the standard sizes 15 on a4 16 on the 325i i live near detroit where we have to deal with snow but its rare to have major snow of more than a few inches to get through in similar conditions the a4 was definitely much better and secure feeling in getting through the snow than the bmw but so far the bmw has been sufficient and i have not felt the need for snow tires the a4 was more fun in the snow since i could really accelerate and let the quattro sort out the traction on the bmw the same action causes the dsc to kick in and i continue forward but slowly and i think in a really tough situation the a4 would be more likely to get me out of it this spring i intend to get a new wheel  tire package for the 325i going to 17x8 wheels with 22545 tires but even though im probably going to stick with allseasons for various reasons i still plan on keeping my current 16inchers around for winter mounting narrower tires within reason work better in the snow and when the current tires get some more wear on them ill replace them with a set of full winter tires that is an interesting snippet is the article available on line car magazine articles are opinions just like yours and mine take a test drive on snow covered roads that you normally have to drive with a rwd sedan and an awd drive sedan then decide which car offers you the most security i found that the rwd based g35x offers awesome dry handling with the added bonus of secure all weather traction ymmv it is or was on line because thats how i found it in the first place im thinking i came across the link to the article in either the 3series or 5series discussion back in 2002 or 2003 ive made a couple of half hearted attempts to find it since i first read it unfortunately no joy so if you do find it please post the link regarding their opinions yup what you said  of course they do manage to back up their opinions with some very interesting facts and figures yeah yeah yeah i know dont confuse me with the facts  best regards\\nshipo when im driving in 12 inches of snow the last thing i care about is acceleration and performance going at 20 mph the first thing i care about is getting home safely the second thing is not getting into an accident and the third thing is not getting stuck ill risk the couple of extra feet of braking from the couple of extra pounds for the tradeoff of not getting stuck but thats just me ahhh i see different thresholds me i stop driving when the stuff on the roads gets to about 8 of rutted snowslush after that my car becomes a snow plow and i dont choose to participate in that profession  if i found myself routinely needing to drive in 12 inches id opt for an suv or a pickup gun rack and beer cooler strictly optional best regards\\nshipo id opt for an suv or a pickup gun rack and beer cooler strictly optional id say if youre out driving on a day where theres 12 of snow on the ground a gun rack and beer cooler are pretty much mandatory ymmv when i lived in montreal we called those days vacation days as far as some of the comments regarding how bad a winter tire shod car will drive on dry roads well im thinking that given the quality of some of the high performance winter tires that have been available for several years now that that statement is a bit disingenuous all of the noise to the contrary winter tires like the h rated michelin pilot alpin pa2s will easily outperform the typical oem allseason tire on dry roads tires such as the continental contitouringcontact or michelin energy mxv4 plus cough lemon which facts are we referring to i think you would find most enthusiast magazines heartily endorse awd version lps in snowy parts of the usa again based on street driving you cant tell me that the fwd based tl is that much of a better performing vehicle than the awd based g3x it just isnt so even though many of you awd haters want it to be so you cant tell me that the fwd based tl is that much of a better performing vehicle than the awd based g3x it just isnt so even though many of you awd haters want it to be so if i ever implied that i thought the tl would out perform the g35x in any way shape or form regardless of road conditions then im truly sorry that was not my intent or my belief as for being a hater of awd that simply isnt the case if i am a hater of anything it is misinformation specific to this discussion im very troubled by folks who believe without question that an awd sedan shod with oem all season tires will outperform a similar or all but identical rwd sedan shod with high quality winter tires from the research that ive done and the driving in weather that ive experienced the only area where the rwd car will be lacking is in acceleration in snow or hill climbing sort of the same thing in every other way the rwdwinter tire car should handily out perform the awdallseason car in my case i live on a street with two sections that feature a climb with a grade of over 75 and my driveway is about 9 through it all my winter tire equipped 530i never had a single problem navigating either that being said there are six houses on my street that sport driveways that the 530i was completely unable to climb in the snow why easy they all have at least a 20 grade between the street and the house were it that i lived in any of those six houses you can absolutely bet that my wife and i would not only be driving cars with an awd drive train but they would both have a set of winter tires as well hmmm a g35x a4 quattro 330xi or 530xi with winter tires if you want to plow through the really deep stuff or climb the really steep hills thats your ticket  best regards\\nshipo lets talk about several scenarios where similar cars one awd and the other rwd where awd has a decided advantage\\nleft turns on snow covered roads on a busy rush hour day betterfaster cornering stability of awd vs your rwd on slippery roads i just dont believe your statement that rwd outperforms awd only in acceleration if you are forced to drive in inclement weather as well as nice weather there is nothing like the security of awd the icing on the cake of owning a car like the g35x is that it is rwd based unless the car detects that you need traction otherwise it drives like its rwd counterpoint the g35 yeah i did notice the emoticon however since i suspect that any number of folks think im a closet awd hater i thought id just state my position for the record just in case  best regards\\nshipo edit it seems that this response to your first version of the truth is outdated by your updated post  left turns on snow covered roads on a busy rush hour day betterfaster cornering stability of awd vs your rwd on slippery roads i just dont believe your statement that rwd outperforms awd only in acceleration i need to split a few hairs here first off lets assume like for like cars ie g35 vs g35x secondly is the awd car equipped with allseason tires asawd or winter tires wtawd third is this hypothetical left turn made from a standing stop or are you rolling through the turn with little or no acceleration if we are comparing asawd to wtrwd then i believe that the following would hold true  from a standing stop meaning that there is an acceleration component the time to make the turn and clear the intersection is probably a wash with the edge going to the asawd\\n rolling through the turn wtrwd should easily complete the turn safer and quicker than the asawd if we are comparing both cars shod with winter tires then i believe the following would hold true  from a standing stop the wtawd should handily beat the wtrwd through the intersection\\n rolling through the turn the wtrwd should have a slight edge due to its lighter weight the icing on the cake of owning a car like the g35x is that it is rwd based unless the car detects that you need traction otherwise it drives like its rwd counterpoint the g35 errr except for the extra weight that is there is another factor that may or may not be present in the two versions of the g35 but is definitely a factor with the likes of the e60 and e90 bmws some manufacturers bmw for instance only offer a true sport package stifferlower suspension and better rubber and wheels on the rwd models while this situation is not really part of the awd vs rwd debate perse it is a very real world factor to be dealt with the standard suspension setup that comes on the awd bmws while still competent is no match for the ones that come on the rwd sp equipped models rain sleet ice snow or dry the better handling suspension is still the better handling suspension to my way of thinking an sp equipped rwd bmw will handle significantly better in the summer months versus the xi version and during the winter months assuming a high performance set of winter tires are used on the sp equipped i it should at least match if not exceed the capabilities of the xi except in hill climbing and acceleration so it seems that youve called my bluff and that wasnt my last word after all  best regards\\nshipo \\x85there are six houses on my street that sport driveways that the 530i was completely unable to climb in the snow\\x85 they all have at least a 20 grade between the street and the house i am pretty darn sure that my outback with as performance tires will do a 20 degree hill from a stop in snow rolling through the turn the wtrwd should have a slight edge due to its lighter weight\\nan interesting opinion what do you base this on have you done time trials errr except for the extra weight that is\\nwhile there is a 150lb difference between the two in street driving there will be very little difference in performance between them on a snowy curvy road your better handling and lighter sport suspension rwd car is going to be left behind by my awd equivalent having all four wheels pulling and pushing you through the curves is going to be faster than snow tires on a rwd only car i think awd has banned from some types of road races because of this inherent advantage my final words on the subject i promise the problem i see with the g35x is that it weighs quite a bit more than the g35 costs 2000 more and is only available with an auto tranny if you live somewhere that you frequently benefit from the safety and security of awd may i recommend the toyota 4runner this terrific vehicle has many of the g35xs attributes youre looking for similar hp length wheelbase price amenities plus the added benefit of 7 passenger seating 7000 lbs towing capacity twice the ground clearance and 25 times more luggage capacity its front bumper will even accomodate a winch just in case you happen to leave the road unexpectedly i am pretty darn sure that my outback with as performance tires will do a 20 degree hill from a stop in snow probably true however all six driveways are facing south west and are paved with ashphalt as such with the sun shining on them the way it has a tendency to do they get these nasty icy patches on them i can only think of one word scary best regards\\nshipo an interesting opinion what do you base this on have you done time trials me personally no it was however proven out in the magazine article that i read i keep thinking that given the emerging popularity of rwd cars along with the continually growing popularity for awd cars that another magazine is going to perform an updated test edmunds yall got yer ears on having all four wheels pulling and pushing you through the curves is going to be faster than snow tires on a rwd only car based upon various things that ive read im thinking that that notion is something of an urban legend because its been repeated so often the fact is that a tire has a certain limit of adhesion and that by adding accelerative forces to a wheel that is doing the turning you reduce that wheels ability to turn or the other way around thinking back to the late 1980s i read a very interesting article about training road course drivers to push their cars to the very limit back then the racing tires were capable of about one g of tractive forces regardless of whether it was linear or lateral and they had developed a cute accelerometer graphing device that would log the drivers ability to keep the needle as close to the 1g mark throughout the entire course while theoretically possible to keep it pegged even the best drivers were unable to keep it there all of the way around however there was a direct correlation between lap times and that magic 1g mark the closer to the mark the faster the time best regards\\nshipo the fact is that a tire has a certain limit of adhesion and that by adding accelerative forces to a wheel that is doing the turning you reduce that wheels ability to turn or the other way around youre referring to the friction circle whether a wheel is being driven or not the tires contact patch with the road surface and the limit of adhesion determines whether the tire will grip or slip period when driving on reduced traction surfaces the ability to maintain control of your vehicle is primarily based on the inate ability of the tire to grip the surface contact area tread pattern rubber compound etc control input smoothness and speed simply put awd helps but its not as important as having the proper tires and driving slowly and smoothly i have never ever owned snow tires and still find driving rwd manageable with the exception of about two blizzard days a year during those days i just walk a short distance to the subway and go to work not exactly a great inconvenience perfect illustration of why cars are not necessary at all you are perfectly correct but i have not even begun the first step among the twelve steps of overcoming my addiction to cars the point you are missing is that a reducedfriction surface is usually not an evenly smooth surface there are patches with more friction than others equally as important when a vehicle is in a turn the four wheels trace out different circles hence different linear velocity the big advantage in an advanced awd system is the ability to apportion torque to the wheel with the most grip its not unlike lsd on rwd cars except this time with lsd on all four wheels rwd with rsd beats rwd without it all else being comparable similarly awd cars win nearly all reduced friction races where they are allowed the disparity is so great as to make the competition between the two incomtemplable in racing circles the fact is that a winter tire equipped rwd sedan with a near 5050 weight balance will easily out drive an otherwise identical allseason equipped awd car not for going up slippery hills which is the most dangerous snow driving winter tires like the h rated michelin pilot alpin pa2s will easily outperform the typical oem allseason tire on dry roads ever checked the price difference per mile of expected tire life span the price difference between rwd and awd that you cite so much can be burn through on two sets of michelin pilot alpines in three winter seasons in fact if you indulge in spirited driving pilot alpines silica compound last only the first 232 inch or so of wear after that they are almost as bad as all seaons in snow btw there are many tripletread allseason tires that can outperform the alpines for snow performance especially after the surface silica compound is gone id say if youre out driving on a day where theres 12 of snow on the ground a gun rack and beer cooler are pretty much mandatory ymmv when i lived in montreal we called those days vacation days when i lived in central ma 12 snow on the ground was called my drive way from december till april every year the town puts up a 2 or 3foot snow bank at the end of my drive way the entire winter the town puts up a 2 or 3foot snow bank at the end of my drive way the entire winter i had a name for those too and the 8 drifts in the backyard snowfort the point you are missing is that a reducedfriction surface is usually not an evenly smooth surface there are patches with more friction than others no i didnt miss anything you are talking about accelerative forces here and all along ive maintained that even a lowly allseason shod awd car will out accelerate a winter tires shod rwd car not for going up slippery hills which is the most dangerous snow driving errr sorry not buying the hill has to be both very steep and very slippery before it becomes an issue the price difference between rwd and awd that you cite so much can be burn through on two sets of michelin pilot alpines in three winter seasons in fact if you indulge in spirited driving pilot alpines silica compound last only the first 232 inch or so of wear after that they are almost as bad as all seaons in snow btw there are many tripletread allseason tires that can outperform the alpines for snow performance especially after the surface silica compound is gone youre making this up as you go arent you obviously you dont have any actual experience with buying and driving on winter tires best regards\\nshipo shipo i trust your opinion i have a 330i 2006 with sport package\\ni dropped down in size to 17 inch wheels\\ni have 22545qr17 on all 4 wheels blizzak ws50\\nright now there is 295 psi in each tire\\nshould i have same pressure in all 4 tires\\nmanual seems to say 29 fronts  36 rears\\njust doesnt make sense to me not to have same psi in all tires\\ni can see summer setup because wheels  tires are different sizes thanks not sure if you have anything useful to add to this discussion lemon  and i question why i should even bother to respond but i will surprise  have you ever owned or driven an awd equipped car on slippery hilly roads real world experience is probably more useful than magazine articles and juvenile humor the g35x is 05 heavier than the g35 just what is this huge problem i can live with the 1 mpg less than the rwd only model i dont care that you dont like the automatic transmission in the real world i have seen 25 mpg on the highway with the g35x why bother with the the rest of your post not sure if you have anything useful to add to this discussion and i question why i should even bother to respond whoa rambo mnrep2 slow down lets not get personal here i am enjoying everyones posts just because you disagree with someone doesnt mean you can be disrespectful its not needed or wanted here a journalist working on a personal finance story about auto insurance is specifically hoping to find some people who pay enormous amounts in auto insurance for example perhaps some young males who own pricey performance cars if youre someone whos paying several thousand dollars annually in auto insurance or has a son or daughter who is please respond to predmundscom before the end of the day weds nov 23 with your daytime contact number shipo i trust your opinion yes and i enjoy his posts as well he and i have a basic disconnect about the parameters of the conversation in that regard were both right and wrong regarding tests in the mags about awd vs rwd unless the mags drive in my conditions in my neighborhood in my traffic my experience trumps their journalistic opinion tweaking tire pressure between front and rear ends alters the handling of the car add more pressure in the front and youll reduce the amount of understeer your car will naturally display virtually every bmw manual ive ever taken a look at recommends anywhere from 4 to 6 psi difference between the front set and the rear set with the rears always being the higher of the two personally ive always been inclined to bump the settings a little iirc i usually ran 3339 in my 328i 3238 in my 530i with the summer tires and 3438 with my winter tires i came up with those settings simply by driving different pressures and deciding what felt the best scientific not even a little did it work for me yup  best regards\\nshipo i know that this is picking a nit here but the g35x is 05 heavier than the g35 just what is this huge problem i havent looked at the actual weight of the g35 anytime recently however im thinking that 150 pounds is more like 5 not 005  best regards\\nshipo i was simply responding in kind to the useless toyota suv crack if you found that a useful suggestion i apologize for responding so aggresively sick i did reply with the opinion that the 200lb weight difference between the rwd g35 and awd g35x was not any big deal imho for street driving backed up by my anecdotal 25 mpg on the highway on a recent road trip with said g35x i have been trying to be respectful to all reasoned and thought out responses ok there you go with those details again p i stand corrected it is 5 not 05 blush \\x85there are six houses on my street that sport driveways that the 530i was completely unable to climb in the snow\\x85 they all have at least a 20 grade between the street and the house i am pretty darn sure that my outback with as performance tires will do a 20 degree hill from a stop in snow i assume that everyone knows that there is a difference between a 20 grade and a 20degree grade percent grade refers to rise over run or basically the tangent of the angle a 20 grade is quite a bit less steep than 20 degrees and in fact a 100 grade would be exactly 45 degrees i assume that everyone knows that there is a difference between a 20 grade and a 20degree grade percent grade refers to rise over run or basically the tangent of the angle a 20 grade is quite a bit less steep than 20 degrees and in fact a 100 grade would be exactly 45 degrees i knew that however my guess is that that is a charitable assumption at best  regarding the driveways in question two of them do in fact climb for some of their distance at ridiculous angles well in excess of a 50 grade is my sotp guess regarding grades and regularly traveled roads iirc the interstate highway system is limited to 8 even in the most difficult to traverse areas of the rockies and the sierra nevadas other areas vary however it is my understanding that most places around the country have adopted the 8 limit as in back in the early 1960s for all new road construction does that mean that steep hills are going away nope many roads are grandfathered in and then there is the whole driveway issue like in my neighborhood does that mean that there are not going to be any new roads that exceed 8 nope as well exceptions are bound to pop up here and there best regards\\nshipo not sure if you have anything useful to add to this discussion sorry i didnt realize that growing up in the snow belt owning all manner of rwd fwd and awd cars over the years and completing a variety of advanced driving schools doesnt qualify me to post here please forgive my intrusion gordon thanks for refreshing my memory i think i learned that in earth science class back in 1963 i have a degree in aeronautical engineering but grade is an aspect that was never used in the discipline i would guess it is used in civil engineering and architecture in any event that means a 20 grade is approx a 113 degree angle and a 20degree angle would be a 36 grade correct simple trig anyway back to my original statement my subie with as performance tires will do a 20degree grade aka 36 grade and i believe most awd cars in this situation can negotiate the angle as well while most twolegged cars would be floundering like fish trying to swim up a waterfall i am now tempted to put winter tires on my 530 and run some empirical tests with both cars after all this rwdawd debate is cyclical with no sign of letting up and inevitably shipo is always right in the middle of it fighting for truth and justice with his snowy new hampshire anecdotes and wisdom of course  i did reply with the opinion that the 200lb weight difference between the rwd g35 and awd g35x was not any big deal imho for street driving 200 lbs is like me driving with my wife and 80 lbs of landscapers bark in car if you cant tell the difference in acceleration handling and ride quality then you certainly wont notice a few more hundred pounds of an suv and if you dont care about fuel economy and the availabilty of a manual transmission thats your personal preference many people do backed up by my anecdotal 25 mpg on the highway on a recent road trip with said g35x although my tongue was in my cheek the fact remains that the 4runner and g35x have similar horsepower length wheelbase price and amenties no anecdotal information there the g35x like the 4runner forces its owner to compromise driving dynamics for the sake of awd my point is that if you live someplace where snow and ice are major forces for months out of the year the g35x is not a panacea for 4seasons motoring on the other hand if snow is merely a minor annoyance why suffer all the awd sacrifices yearround for just a smidge more road confidence a few days a year snow tires and slower speeds are 90 of the solution for winter driving on the days where thats not enough to get you to your destination no awd sport sedan is gonna cut it is this the article you referenced earlier httpwwwcaranddrivercomarticleaspsection_id4article_id3888 nope its way too recent that said thanks for the head up i cannot wait to read it  best regards\\nshipo puhlease i am trying to provide some insight into driving dynamicsadvantages of an awd ellps versus rwd only your tongue in cheek comparison to the 4 runner while cute really offers nothing germane to this discussion if you actually feel that these two vehicles drive the same then i am quite sure you havent driven them and dont offer any useful insight most reviewers that have driven both the g35 and the g35x say that there is about a 3 second difference in 060 times these same reviewers have also stated they cannot really tell the difference in handling between the two cars have you ever driven either car i dont see much difference in real world performance numbers between the rwd version and the awd version the g35x has all of the advantages of awd when needed and the driving dynamics of a rwd sport sedan when the roads are dry p i am trying to provide some insight into driving dynamicsadvantages of an awd ellps versus rwd only yup and im illustrating the disadvantages fair enough your tongue in cheek comparison to the 4 runner while cute really offers nothing germane to this discussion on the contrary it shows a progression from more sportingless weather capable to more weather capableless sporting for example on a sport to weather capable scale of 1 to 10 1 being a lotus elise and 10 being a hummer h1 the g35 is a 3 and the 4runner is a 7 im saying the g35x is a 4 my point again is simply that a vehicle must sacrifice measures of sport to gain measures weather capability the g35x while certainly more sport biased than a 4runner nevertheless makes some of the same suv sacrifices in order to offer awd traction the decision to live with purchase those sacrifices is a personal one most reviewers that have driven both the g35 and the g35x say that there is about a 3 second difference in 060 times these same reviewers have also stated they cannot really tell the difference in handling between the two cars to use your own words real world experience is probably more useful than magazine articles yes i have driven both cars backtoback and yes i felt a definite difference in ride and handling your perception obviously differs i dont see much difference in real world performance numbers between the rwd version and the awd version the numbers may be close but they feel and respond differently the g35x has all of the advantages of awd when needed and the driving dynamics of a rwd sport sedan when the roads are dry no it has the driving dynamics of a 200 lb heavier rwd sport sedan when the roads are dry just because you cant tell the difference doesnt mean it isnt there using the 4 runner seems a round about way to express the small driving differences between the rwd g and the awd g but i get your point i decided the slight differences between the two cars driving the roads that i drive means the g35x was the compelling choice no it has the driving dynamics of a 200 lb heavier rwd sport sedan when the roads are dry just because you cant tell the difference doesnt mean it isnt there if you put the snow tires onto the rwd g 35 it will probably lose the slight handling advantages over the g35x with the all season rubber\\nas they say ymmv  we keep in mind what is our subject here yes what wheel drive is relevant to entrylevel luxury performance sedans but this tangent is taking us into vehicles that arent part of our conversation and for a few of you its taking us into personal comments which really need to be excluded from your posts  confuse for example on a sport to weather capable scale of 1 to 10 1 being a lotus elise and 10 being a hummer h1 the g35 is a 3 and the 4runner is a 7 im saying the g35x is a 4 yes but you saying its a 4 doesnt make it so i cant recall the review that i read before getting the g35x but they test drove both cars and felt the g35x performed better on the sport side due to the extra weight giving the driver more confidence going into and around turns to me this makes sense and was coming from an unbiased source given your rating scale the reviewer would have given the g35x something lower than a 3 maybe a 25 or 26 personally after driving both i couldnt tell a difference when taking an onramp at the highest speed i was comfortable taking yes i have driven both cars backtoback and yes i felt a definite difference in ride and handling your perception obviously differs i suspect your findings were based on your perception heading into the test drives that the awd couldnt perform as well given the extra weight and everything else you seem to know about cars real world driving and how the car feels when you drive it is the only test and opinion that matters when youre spending your own money too bad we couldnt have like a cokepepsi blindfold test and see the results im sure it would be a 5050 split between the awd vs rwd g35  but then again thats just my opinion scott if you put the snow tires onto the rwd g 35 it will probably lose the slight handling advantages over the g35x with the all season rubber on dry pavement i completely agree yes but you saying its a 4 doesnt make it so i cant recall the review that i read before getting the g35x but they test drove both cars and felt the g35x performed better on the sport side due to the extra weight giving the driver more confidence going into and around turns of course youre right if i had to try for complete accuracy id rate the g35 a 3 and the g35x a 32 it was easier to illustrate my point with round numbers but of course its my completely subjective opinion i also agree that a heavier car can feel more planted and confidence inspiring i wont deny that feeling appeals to many people too bad we couldnt have like a cokepepsi blindfold test and see the results im sure it would be a 5050 split between the awd vs rwd g35 yup im sure most people wouldnt be able to tell the difference i should also admit that much of my bias stems from my opinion that the rwd g35 is itself too big and heavy i dont know how anyone can call such a leviathan a sport sedan and adding 200 lbs just fuels my fire is this the article you referenced earlier httpwwwcaranddrivercomarticleaspsection_id4article_id3888 \\nummm id like to take this opportunity to say duh my bad blush yup thats exactly the article that i was referring to when i glanced at it yesterday i noticed a november 2005 date at the top of the page and didnt bother to look any further of course the date was yesterdays date and the real publication date was may of 1999 so that said it seems that my memory is a little faulty in that a rwd vs awd model shod like for like will show the awd model being able to handle a little better than its rwd sibling that one exception aside my basic premise of a winter tire equipped rwd sedan being more capable in the snow except for accelerationhill climb versus its allseason equipped awd stable mate seems to be well proven out in this article per pats suggestion of getting back on topic i suggest that if we want to continue this discussion we should create a new topic maybe awd cars with allseason tires vs 2wd cars with winter tires yes no best regards\\nshipo per pats suggestion of getting back on topic i suggest that if we want to continue this discussion we should create a new topic maybe awd cars with allseason tires vs 2wd cars with winter tires agree but i suggest just making it awd vs 2wd which covers everything handling tires snow rain new hampshire the bronx mexico etc  my basic premise of a winter tire equipped rwd sedan being more capable in the snow except for accelerationhill climb versus its allseason equipped awd stable mate seems to be well proven out in this article in braking yes a clear advantage the slalom test showed about a 12 mph advantage for the rwd winter tire shod mercedes vs the all season shod awd copy not really much difference there if you factor in the fact that when the roads are not snow covered your winter tire shod car will be a poor performer compared to the awd car with all season rubber awd still offers some compelling advantages in minnesota anyway there are long stretches of time that the roads are clear i hope everyone has a safe and fun thanksgiving looking for a new car has to have awd i see the debate above but i live on the side of a mountain its snowy and icy for about 3 months out of the year and i like my garage better than walking up the hill all said i need a car that has excellent acceleration lot of highway driving everyday  so i want some pick up i dont drive to the apex of turns anymore but i dont want to feel the thing rolling all over the place either i want it to be comfortable i am in it 3 hours a day  and it needs to be reliable i have a really long commute and i have no desire sit on the side of the rode i will be shooting to put 200k on the car or more finally it has to have an at so my wife can drive it too i dont want to go any higher than 40k out the door and would prefer 3536 what would the folks here choose and why thx should be right around 40k and if anything like the rwd model is a terrific ride based on your 2 limiting criteria awd and 40k do some research on these acura rl everything you would want if you can squeeze into 40k otd infiniti g35x easily fits your budget audi a4 quattro may have to compromise on some options to fit budget infiniti m35x likely outside budget range vw passat 36l 4motion roomier than a4 but not as much luxury take as close look at options decide what you need want and then price the vehicles i own a g35x but it gets plowed around my way last year i had no problems driving in winter but my allseason tires rsas were new then well see this yeareven water on top of snow and ice presented no problem\\nwith winter tires you should do fine in mountains\\nbut one thing that nobody ever mentions is ground clearence the sedans all probably have only five or so inches of clearence at suspension mounting points and my car seems to have even less at the front chin ive been lucky so far but that icy boulderlike residue left by plows does give me pause maybe an infiniti fx35 might suit your needs good luck the fx x3 are good vehicles but might put you over budget the 325xi would leave you underpowered according to your desire that leaves the g35 and subaru outback xt i believe the subie has a lot of ground clearance tight suspension plenty of room and a nicely powered turbo engine at 250 hp with 250 lbft of torque at 3800 rpm it is also a bangforbuck king in addition to top notch reliability price ranges from 286k to about 34k given your criteria this is the one i would choose its a great allaround beast of burden that according to the december issue of kiplingers the 2006 acura tl was chosen best in class for the second year in a row p bplayers list is helpful  similar to mwhitt im looking at awd sedans would like to stay around 3236k if possible and am currently looking at audi a4 quattro 20t\\ninfiniti g35x\\nlexus is250 awd\\nbmw 325xi\\nacura tl not awd but on my list anyway im currently in a 2003 passat turbo 4cyl i like the driving qualities want a more upscale interior as well as some extra power and the awd not sold on the look of the new passat looking to go to a more premium brand just started looking drove the g35x today which had nice amenities but the 280hp is probably more power than i need at the expense of some things that for me should be a nobrainer at this price range ie trip computer it also drives a little loud the sales guy described it as the trademark infiniti engine growl my commute is beatup city streets so im looking for a soft ride as opposed to an overlytight sport suspension havent yet determined which of the ones on my list is the benchmark against which all others will be measured  suffice it to say that for me the 03 passat is a pretty good benchmark at this point seems like many consider the bmw 3series to be the benchmark particularly for those like me who like the germanengineered driving experience whatever that means im particularly interested in anybodys initial reactions to the new lexus is250 awd  there doesnt seem to be much out there on it yet given that i havent driven the audi lexus bmw or acura yet im open to any input thanks in advance for your thoughts and feedback you may not get a soft ride for any of the cars on your list except for the a4 most of them are classified as luxurysport so the suspension may be too stiff for you make sure that you drive some of these bad road when you test drive another criteria to consider is space especially in the back set if you are not tall or typically very infrequently have average size people in the back then all these cars will be fine if space is an issue i think the is250 will be the first drop out i ended up with an 05 g35x in july there are a multiple of reasons to choose one car over the other but my process of elimination was rwd bias of the awd package\\ng35x has a larger interior volume than the bmw 3 series\\nhave owned german autos prior my 2000 passat glx was a wonderful car but needed a timing belt around 1k am radio had stopped working again 400 repair to keep stock antenna with existing radioand finally the interior at 75k miles was squeaking a lot finally my assumption that a japanese automobile will be more reliable than its german competitors so far im happy with the choice dont know about the 200k miles but i think the infiniti has a better shot than most you have to drive the cars that fit your parameters and pick which one fits your budget and tickles your fancy the best there are a lot of cars for you to choose from have fun shopping thanks for the input mnrep2 and bplayer great advice about testdriving on bad roads bplayer duh shouldve thought of that before i drove the g35x its been snowing here in cleveland over thanksgiving but not enough to really get a feel for the advantages of awd drove the is250 and the acura today yes the is250 is definitely tight on interior space as you noted bplayer not just the back seat ridiculously little legroom but headroom throughout  and im only 59 on a good day having said that the is has all the features i want without paying extra for a bunch of features i dont want the heated and ventilated seats are great the pushbutton start is awesome as with the g35x the is250 redesign is fantastic i found the pickup on the highway to be underwhelming  and i wasnt looking for outrageous it felt like my passat turbo would probably hold its own with the lexus on a pulloutandpass test headtohead the lexus dealership setup was truly impressive  the free carwashes tv room coffee bar eatoffthefloor service dept massive fleet of serviceloaner vehicles pickupdropoff service etc  my daughter compared it to a westin hotel the acura had a great set of standard features i was amazed at the pricepoint with all those features included  acknowledging of course that if it were an awd it would likely be 2k more much roomier than the lexus closer to the g35x in interior space but not as luxuriouslyappointed the dashboard gauges looked dated 80s or 90s styling despite the 32l v6 which is more than adequate for my purposes it didnt have the power of the infiniti my first car was a honda and i love the hondaacura quality and reliability both the lexus and acura handled rough roads firmly but not too stiff mnrep2 your experience is reminding me that im glad to be getting out of my passat before the warranty expires ive already had to have my antenna replaced under warranty as well as the seatheater shorted out and burned my jeans i wonder if audis have similar reliability issues next up  the bimmer and the a4 without driving it on paper the 325xi looks like itll require a number of options to compare to the others that will put it several thousand dollars higher ive got high hopes for the a4  expecting it to come in at a pricepoint and features that fit my budget and preferences bc ill probably be willing to take the 20l instead of the 32l a compromise that for me saves  buff dont forget that you must pay for or perform your own oil changes on the acura lexus and infiniti all the oil changes and 30k service should be considered the audibmw options wont cost you for service until 50k miles the audi is more than a kissing cousin to the passat same corporate parents i would expect similar or worse repair costs that said if you only keep the car for 3 years who cares i liked the rwd based awd of the infiniti versus the fwd based awd of the audi like the is250 the audi still has less space inside than the infiniti enjoy the hunt for your perfect car for the acura depending on where you live dictates the frequency of oil changes for example in extreme conditions the manufacturer recommends changes at 3750 normal driving conditions at 5000 and the least harsh driving conditions allows owners to change oil at 7500 given that 5000 is in the middle and oil changes at the acura dealership are 3000 and multiplying that by ten oil changes  30000 not sure how much the 30000 mile service is but i would venture that it would not be more than 50000\\nbuff i guess you can factor an extra 80000 in considering the acura buff dont forget that you must pay for or perform your own oil changes on the acura lexus and infiniti all the oil changes and 30k service should be considered the audibmw options wont cost you for service until 50k miles  dealers know that and will often throw in oil changes for a couple of years i paid nothing for service on my infiniti for the first 2 years  but not as luxuriouslyappointed the dashboard gauges looked dated 80s or 90s styling despite the 32l v6 which is more than adequate for my purposes it didnt have the power of the infiniti are you saying that the g35 is much more luxurious than the tl\\nyou got to be joking that has always been the g35 downfall its interior looking to replace 2001 audi a4 wagon  the two major problems are tight spacerear seating very tight and rear compartment cant handle two sets of golf clubs and mileage which in town hovers around 21 mpg looking at g35 acura tl or tsx lexus  what do you folks recommend am i too hasty in not investigating audis newer a4 options arrgh how bout the new passat that is bigger than any of the other cars you mentioned do you still want a station wagon looking for more space performance reliability i can get two sets of golf clubs in a 2005 g35x you will have to give us more information if you want more suggestions g35 and tl should be fine tsx and lexus is250350 will be too small for you i think dont know about audi  havent looked into it because it has always seemed undersizedover priced thanks for the imput looked at most of the contenders  listened to salesmens spiels hadnt considered the passat  looks as if theyve redesigned it for 2006 most reviews say its a little expensive relative to the japanese counterparts\\ntrying to get away from a station wagon  back to a sedan\\nthe new a4 looks great but still lacks cargo space\\ng35x has high mpg best overall is acura tl  is the rl just too much car\\nand then theres that cult favorite the outback would this be in the same class as the others\\nthanking you all for your input i sold my 97 c4s which i loved and decided it was time to get practical and hunt for a sports sedan i had an open mind and was open to all options including the g35 coupe is350 the 330i and the a4 i drove all four before i took any test drives i was sure i wanted the lexus however once i sat in it and started to drive i knew it was not for me it felt soft much like a large family car and the cockpit was very cramped as well as the steering wheel being too small it has pretty good acceleration but did nothing to inspire me and clearly is not a drivers car the 330i was very much a drivers car but i just didnt like the interior that much and truthfully didnt really like the snobby attitude at the dealership so that turned me off to them the g35 had tons of torque but the little things really bugged me for example the power seat controls being located up top and the interior didnt seem to have as high quality materials as the others i had driven in addition the fuel economy leaves alot to be desired my last stop was the collection they sell ferrari porsche maserati and audi no sooner did i walk in when i was being offered coffee and pastrys the dealership was gorgeous and the sales guy was a no bs type of guy who i liked i didnt really like the a4s i saw until i saw one with the sline package wow what a looker the interior was the finest i have ever sat in and it was tight and drove beautifully  20t  6 spd i was sold i knew audis depreciate horribly so leasing was the only option for me they had a great 24 month lease program with 75 residual value and 00139 money factor that simply cannot be beat i am driving a 40k car with nothing down and 480 a month as well as free maintenance to boot trust me i was never a fan of audi but after driving all 4 there was no comparison just make sure you get the s line package good luck to all sounds like the right choice for you shades enjoy your ride you are in the same boat i am in i have narrowed to the two extremes g35x and the outback xt limited for a variety of reasons i need awd so these are where i have landed frankly i like the audi best of all but nobody seems to be able to convince me of the reliability and service experience that i desire it is a great drive but these boards continue to say never own outside of warranty well i cant accept that i put far too many miles on a car to be trading every 15 years on the passat  my wife has an 02 4motion that has been a dream but her friends had nightmares on the same car and traded within 6 months not into roulette on the xt the owners say it is a great value handles well and great  value with their incentives you can out around 30k32k depending on option load i did a check of used cars on carsdirectcom and there are a lot with 150k miles add in that cr rated the subaru outback as one of the most reliable used cars to purchase i think i can get a g35x for 36k without ttl i drove that car for an hour the other day comfortable handled well powerful and my sisterinlaw says it handled beautifully in the snow and ice dont love the gas mileage and i really dont need 300hp but i trust japanese reliability above audi btw i looked at bmw xi nice car but cant justify the premium for the badge g35x doesnt have 300hp and 36k my god do you have every option on it g35s sell for a few hundred above invoice sorry i rounded up i tend to do that i know it has 280 my point was it is closer to 300 than anything else i have looked at which is quite a bit of juice on the 36k got your point a relative paid 353 or something like that last year i just saw on the other board 344 for exactly what i am looking for at premium and something else so that draws the price diff down to about 4k since you rack up the miles and would exceed normal warranty in a year and a half an extended warranty on the audi may bring it back into the picture that way you could could drive it for 3 years without a concern you might want to consider this for other vehicles as well just a thought since there is no porsche board so i would just side track the forum a bit\\nas a former c4s owner how is the reliability of the porsche compared to bmw and how is the the cost within the warranty and after warranty is expired\\ndoes it like bmw which is pretty costly\\ni am thinking about getting the new c4s thank you very much todays porsches are commonly considered bulletproof they usually lead their respective categories for initial quality and long term reliability at least from everything ive read thats what ive seen theres no comparing a vwmbaudibmw to a porsche for build quality or longevity i was under the impression that the cayenne was one of the least reliable suvs out there porsche actually has one of the worst jd power initial quality ratings but also has one of the best dependability ratings so go figure confuse i was talking about porsches not a vw suv thats not a porsche thats just an embarassingly ugly junk pilejust like the x3x5 porsche cars are scary reliable porsche truckswell theyre vws so you cant expect much errr sorry not buying the hill has to be both very steep and very slippery before it becomes an issue hmm if the is not very steep or very slippery both awdrwd and allseasonwintertires can handle it all whats the point of the discussion again we are talking about extreme driving conditions where traction is an issue otherwise whats the point of the discussion youre making this up as you go arent you obviously you dont have any actual experience with buying and driving on winter tires thank you for letting me on the news i have had experience with winter tires ever since my 1982 bmw 528e its been more than half a dozen cars since then for me yeah but if you have to do repairs it probably costs a mint even maintenance is probably costly at porsche specialist shops supposedly prototype to make its debut at ny auto show with 330 hp host of questions its engine answers the volley from lexus but will it have the chassis to match 3 infiniti fans certainly expect so since it reportedly borrows a lot from upcoming gtr and considering chassis of 5 and m are very closely matched most people dont need 330 horses will there be a g25 what will infiniti do to invigorate its v8 45 to put distance between its v6 and v8 theres an obvious power war between lexus and infiniti will acura have to ditch its sohc to join the war what will audi and mb have to do with their v6s or risk being left behind bmw might just want to do its own thing with its i6 its engine answers the volley from lexus but will it have the chassis to match 3 infiniti fans certainly expect so since it reportedly borrows a lot from upcoming gtr and considering chassis of 5 and m are very closely matched i do not think infiniti needs to answer to lexus why does the chassis need to match 3\\ngtr has a pretty good chassis of its own and i do not think gtt should be compared to 3 it should be compared to 911 or z06 i think bmw 5 and m5 have the same chassis most people dont need 330 horses will there be a g25 what will infiniti do to invigorate its v8 45 to put distance between its v6 and v8 i do not think 330 is enough i need 400 p\\ntoo many cars and engines will hurt your sales because of the huge overhead theres an obvious power war between lexus and infiniti will acura have to ditch its sohc to join the war what will audi and mb have to do with their v6s or risk being left behind bmw might just want to do its own thing with its i6 i think the power war is among all the manufacturers not just between lexus and infiniti because it is the simplest way to give you cars more values without raising the price\\nhonda will only offer v8 when there is a need and again there is not a need not now or ever on the street\\naudi a3 has a new v6 and mb e350 has a new v6 as well\\nbmw 3 series have a new v6 too no one is left behind bmw 3 series have a new v6 too in fact it is a new inline 6 cylinder engine now i guess the most exciting new car worth waiting for will be the infiniti g37 do not think infiniti needs to answer to lexus why does the chassis need to match 3 because right now the g35s chassic cant compare to the e90 or even e46 the chassis high ride height and roughness of the vq drove me to bmw if infiniti can fix those issues ill gladly come back to nissan \\ni do not think 330 is enough i need 400\\ntoo many cars and engines will hurt your sales because of the huge overhead tell that to bmw mb lexus and audi a 30 g35 with 240 hp would sell just fine a 35 with 320 would be the next bump everybody but acura and infiniti exist using the dual engine sales model having done much research and quite a few test drives its down to the line between acura tl and lexus es 330 but the issue that might tip the balance is mpg and gasoline given that gas may well rise to back to postkatrina levels it seems to make more sense to go for lexus  with slightly higher mpg and a regular gas consumer to boot sacrificing the slightly greater responsiveness of the tl anyone care to weigh in on this youre worrying about gas prices in this price range of cars i dont see any real difference on the mpg maybe you see something different than what edmunds is showing so it comes down to premium vs regular which is what 025 a gallon if that what are you saving couple of hundred a year if you are 15k a year driver if youre indifferent between the cars go for the lower gas costs i guess i wouldnt think that if you can lay out over 30k out the door for a car that this savings would mean a whole heck of lot i would say throw out the gas issue and pick the car you like the most seems like a nonstarter to me i dont get why you worry about gas prices its gone up for a while and people are still driving like crazy the diff between 87 and 91 is 20 thats only 250 diff for every 10 gallons mpg also depends on how you drive as well i can get better mpg in the tl than other ppl can in the es i think my 330i sucks a lot of gas but i dont complain i mean if youre gonan spend 3040k on a car whats another 15 a month elliedog imo i really enjoyed test driving the es and thought it was luxurious solid and a comfortable drive that being said yes you need only put in regular gasoline in the lexus but to say that the acura has only slightly greater responsiveness is a misstatement in my opinion the tl although fwd is in a different category than the es as far as performance is concerned btw are you prepared to spend 3000035000 this year on a vehicle that is getting remodeled for 06 i agree with all of the points made by those who commented before me i would particularly emphasize that there is no slightly greater responsiveness of the tl over the es its significantly greater responsiveness imho if you are a very conservative driver and are more interested in a soft ride than handling maybe the lexus is the best choice for you the es is getting todally redesigned in spring 2006 so be care of thatyou will be buying a car ready to be redesigned soon the new ones will have better power more features and hopefully a better sound system as the base in the es was nothing great you can put regular in your tl is you want and it may reduce its performance to es330 levels mileage will probably drop also i agree with the others these cars are really not the same at all in terms of driving dynamics why is it that anytime we do a comparo discussion we only compare new cars why not compare a brand new cts with a threyear old 7series for example or something that would cost about the same as the new cts i know some of us only want new but some of us are in the i have 40k to spend on a car and i want something cool and sporty and luxurious wed consider a used car fire up a new discussion on that subject if it interests you because the vast majority of people on this  related boards lease the reasons vary but the fact that being without warranty coverage on european cars in this price range makes sphincters tighten is very high on the hit parade right behind not being able to actually afford the car in the first place me i buy cars im with you all the way buying an offlease 3639 month old car is a very good idea but only for those with good longterm reliability that you dont think have been abused standard transmission cars with sport packages dont fall into that category so its not a good choice for me because the vast majority of people on this  related boards lease is that true i did not know that seriously cant you get a bmw warranty on a used bmw yes and no you can get a bmw cpo but for a very high price in the end i wouldnt trust an offlease car mixed with it being german nobody else makes cars that are as engaging imho so the choices become few and far between with my car ill turn it in then bmw will cpo it and resell the bucket of bolts to some poor guy hell drop 2829k for a car that will fulfill his friends negative comments on german cars hi all im thinking about either the is250 awd or a bmw 330xi this is my first new car purchase in a long time went to the lexus dealership for a test drive i live in chicago and there was a dusting of snow on the ground  nothing remotely serious first strange thing the guy coming in from his test drive remarks that the driver assist feature came on during his test drive i didnt pay much attention however i was taking a pretty easy turn which would not have been a problem for my old camry and the is slipped on the turn causing the driver assist feature to kick in this disturbed me i dont think though i have little experience the 330xi would have done that could this just be a tire issue or is this driver assist system screwed up has anyone else experienced this with the is or has anyone driven the is in snow i like the features for price of the is though it feels a little cramped but i really liked the way the bmw drove felt very firm and controlled however it wasnt snowing when i test drove the bmw i have never owned either a lexus or a bmw thanks for any help or experience wiggling hi wiggling  welcome sounds like the discussion at this link is just what you need 2006 bmw 3series vs 2006 lexus is enjoy i have a 325i not xi in the detroit area and so far have gotten along ok with the standard allseason tires through one winter although this year is looking like it could be a lot worse anyway my impression is that the more recent stability controllers are getting more sensitive and tend to kick in with very little slippage in some cases i guess this is good but i find that i often prefer turning off the dsc and letting the car spin its wheels and fishtail a little bit with the dsc on i had a couple instances of pulling out from a slippery side street onto a main road when the dsc kicked in and caused the car to feel like the engine just bogged down bigtime and there i was trying to get into a moving flow of traffic with no power id prefer a little wheelspin and im fully capable of keeping it moving in the right direction so dont let the stability controls kicking in unfairly color your opinion of either car even though the bmw is the obvious choice  sorry if this goes out of topic but if your car\\nhas more than normal reliability issues and has been in repair shop many many times would bmw still cpo it in any case shouldnt its resell value reflect this fact id be willing to bet theyll cpo it who knows for certain btw im not sure my reliability problems are viewed as problems by bmw they dont feel the engine stutter is a problem as they simply refuse to fix it the coils sensors and blown light bulbs were all considered no big deal as theyre known issues with e46s the broken ebrake from the factory was probably viewed as a factory default the electrical problemswell my dealer seems to think that its not immediately repoducible and therefore not a problem either i tested my new 2006 mercedes c350 luxury wo 4matic for mileage at a rocksteady 65 mph on level freeway cruise controlled and clocked an amazing 341 mpg within 22 miles it may have exceeded this but my commute destination had already arrivedbut with my normally unhealthy driving habits rushcentric i am averaging about 245 mpg the car is officially rated 2029 on cityfreeway i have yet to complete 1 month of ownership does anyone have the realworld mpg numbers for comparable 3series g35 or is350  on my 330i 6 speed i get over 30 mpg on long freeway drives averaging 95100 mph ive never tried going 65 on the freeway so i cant say what sort of mileage my 330i would get at that speed on my 330i 6 speed i get over 30 mpg on long freeway drives averaging 95100 mph ive never tried going 65 on the freeway so i cant say what sort of mileage my 330i would get at that speed blueguy  you crack me up directviewefdc5b231 i would be very interested in your folks thoughts at this other thread best car used or new for 40000 the basic parameters are sporty nice freeway drive seats 4 and gets at least 28 mpg since were spending 40k i probably dont need to specify luxury as most offerings at that price are going to have at least a minimum of luxury feel 2003 530\\nacura

cars and i like sportier vehicles so many of them are automatically off the list i can live without a lot of so called creature comforts what are your thoughts i posted the following in error several days ago in the luxury performance sedans board apparently there are fewer manual transmission fans there than i thought anyway fwiw a couple of years ago i learned that my present car lincoln ls was going to be cut adrift  its not discussed here but six years ago we thought it was going to be quite something oh well   itll good for the forseeable future but in the next 630 months ill probably pull the lanyard on something different i have three requirements for my lux or nearlux car 1 manual transmission 2 rearwheel drive 3 must carry my bicycle inside really big back seat folddown seatbacks or avant style then i have a few nicetohaves good longterm reliability 100200k miles decent fuel mileage  dealers that have a clue regarding sports sedans  proper service the only three lux or nearlux vehicles on the planet that meet my requirements are the bmw 3 the bmw 5 and the g35 coupe given that i compromised and added the is250 no folddown seat the a4 avant awd  the a3 frontwheel drive to my matrix and imho the longterm reliability of both the bmw  audi are suspect i tend to avoid bells  whistles but still like some amenities sport suspensionwheelstires upgraded audio  xenons homelink is simple  useful i appreciate being able to select just what i want german though the infiniti premium package covers most of what i want without too much fluff i looked at the 330 since the upgraded audio  xenons were standard but the extra dollars beyond that were wasted on me i guess i dont crave the extra horsepower  much of the rest i care about even less two that meet all my requirements bmw 3  g35 coupe came within 40 of each other sticker or invoice set up the way i want my present car has taught me that extra size and weight as in the bmw 5 are of little value hmmm    i yap a lot about asian reliability but the reality is that i could have a 325 for the same price as a g35 in country since im more than willing to do the ed thing the 325 starts to look even better plus which electric red is just about the most attractive to me colour in the class and finally shipo has helped me come to grips with the concept that owning a bmw doesnt necessarily cause one to become a poseur andor lower life form more later as i review the last 35 pages of each of the brochures those tables are where the action is for me  the standard equipment  option packages take awhile to dissect  compare edit  i may add the cts to the mix more research is required though im very reluctant to try yet another american franchise used to dealing only with people who have been in the aarp at least 15 years im really struggling im going from a convertible that is fairly spartan it has neither luxury nor sportiness but i like it for what it was still i dont want another one we already have an suv which gets used for toting the teenagers and their friends to soccer etc and for getting us up to the mountains on occasion so i need a daily commuter that i wont be embarassed to be seen getting out of in the corporate parking lot plusi simply can not drive a gas guzzler because of the job i have it would be inappropriate for me to drive something that gets 15 mpg and looks like it is getting 15 mpg my current car passes the smell test and does get 21 mpg but a mustang wouldnt and i do get some grins personally by driving a fuelefficient vehicle but thats just me my only experience buying used was not a great one yes i ended up with a nicer car than i would have bought new but i did end up with maintenance issues that i would have been less likely to have if i bought new will a 2003 5series really be that likely to cause me problems i appreciate your thoughtsbut how does the cts work for you does the rear set fold down can you really get a bike in there i drove an srx and i really liked it but we chose a different suv i bet the cts is a great ride they also come in red but euro delivery rocks why doesnt gm let us pick up cars at the cadillac plant since you are considering the a3 why not the v50 i believe it would be cheaper than most of the other cars on your list too a3 is fwd too but i really enjoyed renting one in europe once but it was a 19 tdi the reality is the the a3 is out because no rwd and the a4 has awd but given where i live i dont want to drag around the extra weight all in the front theyre just in for the sake of completeness  curiousity  what would one equipped the way i want cost that sort of thing i priced out the 28 litre cad last night and will do the 36 next i just dont see me setting myself up to be disappointed by another american car company thats pretending for awhile that it wants to build a competitive sport sedan eventually the bean counters will probably win as previous poster pointed out the a3 is fwd too and that was on the original list both are available in awd as well it would be cool if you could rent a car for a month for less than 50day to see if you liked it are there any businesses out there that work on that model\\ni guess there are places where you can rent just about any car you want for a week granted it might not be equipped like you want but if it has the engine trans setup that you want youd get a lot of good info damn i cant get my bike in this back seat am sure you can rent a cts for a few days to see if it is a poseur or the real thing im not sure the a3 is available in the us as awd if so edmunds needs to revisit their edmundscom database in any event awd is a barely acceptable alternate to rwd with fwd totally unacceptable in my world i neglected to answer your earlier question regarding cts folddown rear seats yes they are available in the 400 range what ive learned given my need to store my bicycle inside the car is that folddown rear seats doesnt necessarily yield an acceptable result in an effort to improve torsional rigidity some of the cars that advertise  deliver folddown rear seats dont mention that the resulting hole isnt rectangular and as wide as the interior its a rounded triangle that may or may not accept a bicycle sans its front wheel renting the car to do a test isnt necessary clean up your bike and take it to the dealer try it thats my plan the g35 coupe which is either 1 or 2 on my hit parade on any given day relative to the 325 has one of these triangular passthroughs in due course ill determine whether its adequate and of course i need to check out the bmw in the same fashion as well as the cts any car that cant accomodate my bicycle inside the vehicle need not apply a3 32 is awd edmunds is not very useful for new car facts they have decent reviews and good forums but never trust any of the info on the site otherwise httpaudiusacommodel_home0bodystyleid1300htmlbodystylea3sedan after reading so many educated posts here i took the plunge and bought a 06 cts with the bigger engine and lots of options my salesperson said the only item i missed was the nav so far i have 70 miles on it and no problemslol just wanted to thank all you folks for your input and knowledge regarding this beautiful car ill keep you all informed of any issues that arise or hopefully just to share the great driving experience congrats i assume when you say bigger engine that you are not referring to the ctsv it is great that a legitimate competitor in this class comes from the us new engine should offer more performance but not familiar with cts options sport pkg audio pkg etc what did you get also what color there is a beautiful metallic red that ive seen before i grew up in a caddy family probably before your time i can remember my dad taking me with him each time he bought a new black sedan deville  56 59 64 67 70 then went off to college he then bought caddy fleetwoods until he died never had the sts or cts back then and wonder how he would have liked them submitting corrections via the feedback form at the help link on the left would just take a few seconds and would be very helpful to everyone who is looking for the information  ok wait so when you said\\ngiven that i compromised and added the is250 no folddown seat the a4 avant awd  the a3 frontwheel drive to my matrix you werent serious\\njust want to clarify you werent serious\\njust want to clarify well im not entirely sure how serious any of this is but my hidden agenda is to compare everything that even remotely interests me that can be had with a manual transmission the pickings are getting slimmer i threw the audi offerings in because i thought they might finally be offered in the us with the diesel no joy i even looked at an x3 because it has the manual option and lots of room for the bike in any event ive got a matrix involving nine vehicles of which only a few are real contenders  bmw 3s 325  330  the g35 coupe if i wished to be whipped about the head and shoulders and disappointed yet again by an american brand that thinks it wants to compete id add the two ctss to the mix not bldy likely but still remotely possible frontwheeldrive volvo i dont think so read through your list both original posting and subsequent if youre including bmw 5series and 3series why not the mb equivalents you have the bmw 325330 and the g35 coupe id put the mb c280c350 solidly in the same plane  and slightly more desirable for my needs which are close to yours  but lacking the need for a bike to store  which might be a stickier point the mb is smaller than either of the others just curious you are correct about the mb my new c350 luxury rwd is one amazing power machine and super smooth and quick at hispeed passings luv it sporty when i need it and luxurious at other timesi am getting addicted to those heady rushes handling is lightnimble yet has a solid feel and the braking makes me confident for speeding negatives   it may be the most expensive in its category but only about 05k more than similarly loaded 330i another thing against it may be that it looks absolutely the same as the much cheaper c230 which may be why we do not see many c350s on the road but mostly c230sbut i do not mind the cost so long as the performance satisfies me how many miles on the dc c350 how many days in the shop 3120 miles so farzero days in the shop so far nice\\nyou got the rwd not the awd do not need awd where i live plus the mpg is big plus on the rwd what do you guys think of the upcoming lexus gs350h hybrid performance and mpg in a luxury reasonably sporty package i think it looks sweet siginficant hp good handling and the mgp of a camry or better i just wish it was only 40k can the mb cs be had with a manual ive been under the possibly mistaken impression that all mercs use automatics besides which the design robustness andor build quality reputation of the brand hasnt been all that hot lately also compared to the cars on my list the merc at least in my mind is more about luxury  less about sport i cannot answer to your qs on buildquality i am doing fine so farbut my 7speed c350 lux has a touch shift no clutch and also an automatic shift mb specs also state that there is no difference in acceleration numbers 060 is 61 secs between the two mechanisms if you are looking at pure sport look at the c350 sportwhich has the 6speed manual there is a detailed review both ve and ve at cd\\nhttpwwwcaranddrivercomarticleaspsection_id3article_id10116 cd tested this car 060 in 55 secs if you want to buy a hybrid as an environmental move good for you i dont think theres any economic payback for any of the hybrids yet plus their real potential benefit is in city driving so unless your driving is primarily urban you probably wont benefit much from the increased mileage negatives   it may be the most expensive in its category but only about 05k more than similarly loaded 330i uh try a good 56k more expensive than an ed 3 series plus maintenance costs buy the 330i ed and the c class msrp looks positively ghastly man when are people going to accept that an automatic with steptronicsportsticktiptronictouchshift is still just an automatic it doesnt come close to the speed or feel of a manual there are no clutches in those setups the only automanuals that come close are called smg decent and dsg superb but those actually have clutches and shift at a rate thats faster than a human can dance through a manual the c230 and c350 can be had with manual transmissions comparing ed bmw with us msrp mb is silly mb has ed as well i think that mb is a strangely overlooked brand in this category it is a fine car albeit less filled with nifty toys than its japanese counterparts but it is rock solid responsive and attractively designed it is a contender ive always found the cclass to be a handsome car i believe you can get a c350 with a 6 speed manual mbs reputation during the last few years does scare me a bit the car has been around since the fall of 00 as an 01 model drive the bmw and the mb back to back and see what you think is sportier the 3 series will come out on top i agree with blueguydotcom i dont care how close the 060mph  14 miles times are between sticks and their power sucking torque converter counterpart slushboxes are it just isnt the same driving experiencewise div2 said it best in his roundel article a few months back i also understand that stick isnt for everybody that is simply not correct i had done this analysis before purchasing my mb and wanted to share pricingfeatures of bmw 330i vs bm c350 sport the models were built via their web sites comparable options have been loaded of course people have their preferences for ride quality looks etc moreover the cclass can be easily obtained at near invoice price while bmw cannotfor me this tilted the net price difference to mbs favor my personal conclusion  the mb is significantly more powerful and smoother and has betterlooking interiorexterior the bmw is supposed to be better at handling and also has an edge on build quality but the mb has the starpower i chose the mb \\nbmw 2006 330i sedan m s r p 36600\\n 30

feasible ed prices for an mb is it even worthwhile to do mbs ed ive never heard of someone getting 56k off an mb msrp using the mercedes ed program quote from mbusacomhttpwwwmbusacomedpvehicleslineupdo now you can enjoy a 7 customer savings on c e s and clkcoupe model european delivery purchases this used to be 10 i think about 34 months ago bmw web site promises a saving of 2560 on ed 330i httpwwwbmwusacombmwexperienceeuropeandeliverysavingshtmnavidoverviewe d i think your info of 56k savings may not be current omparable options have been loaded of course people have their preferences for ride quality looks etc moreover the cclass can be easily obtained at near invoice price while bmw cannotfor me this tilted the net price difference to mbs favor uh what an e90 bmw can be purchased if one is willing to do the dealer game for 1k over invoice whats near invoice on an mb 200 500 btw the bmw cold weather package has your ski bagfold down seats bum warmers and headlight washers for 1k the mb you listed came out to be 2300 more expensive plus the cost of maintenance for 4 years 8001000 not sure what you mean by mb star powermb lost all cache the moment they joined up with dodge then again i cant see buying a car for how its perceived by others roflany person who uses bmws site for doing ed deserves the rip off that occurs that way if one looked into ed one would know theres an ed invoice price and you build your car from that and negotiate the dealers profit  8001200 an e90 330i with the toys i want sport comfort access leather is 408k ed invoice price including 1k dealer profit 35645 add in the bmwcca rebate and its 35145 a 5600 savings that 47k mb plus extra maintenance cost doesnt seem so appealing httpjonbimmerfestcombulletins3seriesupdate1pdf check page 3 euro delivery munich pick up thats your starting point on ed negotiations and theres a whole forum here devoted to it many people who frequent this board also have used ed if one looked into ed one would know theres an ed invoice price and you build your car from that and negotiate the dealers profit that is a very valid argument about the ed invoice price for bmw but the same can be said about the mb ed invoice price too it is the same gameyour point about the 56k savings is not really convincing so whats a realistic price for an mb c350 via ed i wouldnt know how to lay my hands on the pdf for bmw like you did for the bmw ed wholesale prices but it should be possible to make safe guesses of offset 2670 based on the mb msrpinvoice prices in us then one may also factor in the special sale events too to achieve a rounded diff of about 3k this diff can be used to drive down below the mb ed msrp prices would this assumption be incorrect i can understand a couple of hundred  here and there but your belief of 56k difference between ed of bmw and mb is not credible another thing i found when talking with mb dealership is that it seems they are willing to negotiate the c350s more than the topselling c230s one can use this to advantage nyccarguy writes in post 5049 mbs reputation during the last few years does scare me a bit the care has been around since the fall of 00 drive the bmw and the mb back to back and see what you think is sportier the 3 series will come out on top respectfully i dont agree  because one of the major premises seems incorrect about being around since fall 2000 first of all the engine and transmission for the c350 new to the cclass for 2006 and the transmission is new in total for 2005 i dont know how long the engine has been around  but not that long its a new car moves faster shifts better second the new mb c350 has greater horsepower and torque than the new bmw 330i  although they are close  not sure how this translated in the driving experience  but would have to test i cant imagine bmw would have much of an edge  the cars are nearly as evenly matched as you can get third for me maneuverability is a plus the mb cseries has a tighter turning radius than the bmw 3series its also 45 narrower  which is huge in the urban area where i live makes it easier to squeeze through and feel in control the best way to find out is to try each and see what meets your needs i was surprised by the new mb cseries on paper  but i cant talk too strongly in that ive only seen them not driven them can the mb cs be had with a manual yes as others have pointed out yes they can and its a very nice 6speed to boot short solid throws best among those i tested the others being the bmw 3series and the infiniti g35 ps i own two bmws and am quite happy with both but right now im salivating over an slk350 roadster first of all the engine and transmission for the c350 new to the cclass for 2006 and the transmission is new in total for 2005 i dont know how long the engine has been around  but not that long its a new car moves faster shifts better with mbs recent qualityreliability problems do you really want to take a chance on a brandnew engine and transmission yikes second the new mb c350 has greater horsepower and torque than the new bmw 330i  although they are close  not sure how this translated in the driving experience  but would have to test i cant imagine bmw would have much of an edge  the cars are nearly as evenly matched as you can get numbers on paper are only numbers on paper 060 times c350  64 sec 330i  61 sec numbers lie third for me maneuverability is a plus the mb cseries has a tighter turning radius than the bmw 3series its also 45 narrower  which is huge in the urban area where i live makes it easier to squeeze through and feel in control the mb has 8 better turning radius than the bmw hardly anything noticeable as for the mb being narrower  cclass shoulder and hip room are considerably tighter about 2 than the 3series rearseat legroom is also 15 tighter in the mb the best way to find out is to try each and see what meets your needs i was surprised by the new mb cseries on paper  but i cant talk too strongly in that ive only seen them not driven them exactly specs and reviews and comparisons are just paper there is no substitute for driving the two cars and comparing for yourself diesel is forbidden in the us right this is a shame as alpina have just output a nice diesel version of the bmw e90 3 serie httpwwwautobilddetestneuwagenartikelphpartikel_id10306artikel_seite 1 i translate you the specs \\ndisplacement 1995 cm³ 149 147 kw 200 hp 4000rpm max torque 410 nm290 lbf at 2000rpm sixspeed

expensive but on the other hand this is the cheapest alpina offer alpina is said to be for bmw what amg is for mbenz thanks for the info pote since asking the question ive taken the effort to answer it on my own the 9car matrix mentioned earlier by me has now become 11 would i wish to be caught dead in a mercedes no otoh i felt much the same about bmws until recently but for much different reasons i will attempt to be objective but that electric red bmw 3 is calling me ill buy enough insurance to get me to 100k and if its been a trooper to that point then ill go bare my favourite road in the world upon which to evaluate cars is between nevada  california in an area where almost no one goes there is a corner rh where the road drops away  if the car isnt up to it people die ive done it in a 240z a 510 two different miatas an eagle vision my lincoln ls and    wait for it a chevrolet belair some of my cars have done much better than others i think the 3 will eat it up im not so sure about the merc the g35 may do well but will have burnt much more fuel getting there and acceleration on this road is irrelevant  handling rules i know the engine and transmission of the c class is all new i was referring to the body style which came out in september 2000 as a my 2001 vehicle diesel is forbidden in the us right mb and vw sell diesel cars in the usa ford chevy mopar sell diesel trucks here quite simply americans tend to be myopic and ignorant thus they have harbor opinions on diesel dating back to the 70s and 80s diesels bdr127  first of all i was replying to a previous post  not necessarily touting the mb c350 a lot of people throw out lists here  and exclude mb from the comparison set the canadian starting this recent thread included the bmw 3series and the g35 but not the mb im still puzzled about that my purpose in the post is to point out that mb is a good option cant understand why so many people dont even consider it i never said the mb was head and shoulders over the bmw its just so many others say the bmw is great  and never consider the mb i dont get it  they look darn close to me with on paper a slight edge to mb for my needs in my car searches i drove volvo for the last 15 years ive always been happy with them until my most recent purchase visibility is poor turning radius is much bigger than previous version so now im looking for a replacement i didnt really consider mb at first either until i saw the c350c280 on paper the new cseries fits what im looking for small car high performance good visibility i agree the reliability issues are of some concern although im not concerned with a newish engine and transmission mb hasnt had problems there its been primarily electronics and some suspension from what ive seen just out of curiosity a side question who exactly is paying for the bmwcca rebate obviously not bmwcca i dont see how they can have the reserve to cover the potential claims that can happen in a year when a hot car is inctroduced is the dealer paying for the 1400 or bmwusa if the latter why not hack it out of their hands anyway with or without bmwcca membership by simply refusing to buy the car if you dont get the mostfavored treatment its not like bmwusa is getting money from the roundel or something to offset the difference in other words anyone who buys an e90 330i in the us in a conventional purchase is ripped off to the tune of 5600 for a car that is really worth only 3536k mb has its own msrpinflating shenenagins lease deals with low money factor and inflated residual a well equipped c280 can be leased for 365mo at prevailing normal bank interest rate and realistic residuals the monthly rent corresponds to a car in the 2628k range an e350 lease is 529mo corresponding to a car in the 38k range assuming unsubsidized bank rates and realistic residual the real loser of course is the consumer who will have to pay excise tax every year according to a certain percetage of msrp for a car actually is being sold in the market place for much much less the real loser of course is the consumer who will have to pay excise tax every year according to a certain percetage of msrp in other words anyone who buys an e90 330i in the us in a conventional purchase is ripped off to the tune of 5600 for a car that is really worth only 3536k i can agree with this statement somewhat one example buying a brandname suit at a discount warehouse vs buying the same suit at an upscale store one saves thousands buying the same suit at the former of course there is not real loser only real customers you can elect to pay the going rate or market price for the e90 or rolex mb armani suit tl or steak at the palm etc or not you dont like the going rate you are always free to vote with your dollars somewhere else to date i have only testdriven the c230 and the 325 i thought they were quite comparable in road feel with the c230 having to my eye the more appealing interior both seemed underpowered however so i plan on testing the 330 and the c350 both with mt bmw na pays the rebate i think they recognize the value of loyal customers and this is a pretty useful way to identify them and since it comes from bmw and not the dealer there is no way to negotiate it into the deal if you arent a member regards\\nkyfdx\\nhostprices paid forums on the other hand none of the diesel cars that mb and vw are selling will be able to pass the new emission standards applied to all cars gasoline or diesel regardless how clean the diesel fuel of future gets diesel combustion is simply a messier process due to its higher combustion temperature the very source ofdiesel efficiency also produces higher level of nox europeans governmetns tend to cut slacks for diesels on their higher nox emission thanks for the clarification roundel subscription however does not necessarily mean current or past ownership of bmw and vice versa    so the loyal customers part is hardly proven since the subscriber may not even be an existing customer the manufacturers incentive qualification is even more flimsy than existing owners of     qualifications that gm used to put out on their products    all of which meant theres extra money on the table for the taking whether you qualify or not    so long as you have the balls to insist just out of curiosity a side question who exactly is paying for the bmwcca rebate dont know dont care its 500 off the effective sales tax rate and more importantly the annual excise tax rate since that needs to be paid every year is much higher for vehicles that have inflated msrp but actually selllease for significantly less btw the current lease deals on some of the mbs actually make them attractive deals    so long as the sales and excise tax rate in ones home state are not too high eg the lease deals on c230 and c280 are practically in v6 accord and camry territory that of the e350 not a typo not c350 is in is territory incredible deals indeed not sure how namebrandness have anything to do with effective tax rate that figure though depends on the state depending on whether these taxes apply to the entire vehicle cost msrp or cap cost or the portion prorated for the lease in most states the annual excise tax is a certain per centage of msrp of the vehicle sales taxregisteration fee is also usually caculated based on msrp in recent years they used to be based on actual sales price or some kind of statemandated minimum for used cars depending on model and model year heres an example in nj the lessee pays applicable taxes based on the portion of the vehicle leasednot the msrp in addition registration fees are calculated based on the weight of the vehicle not the msrp nj is one of the 20 states that do not have excisetaxproperty tax that is based on the value of the car the other 30 states do httpwwwncslorgprogramsfiscalautotaxshtm for example in ma vehicle owner and passed onto lessee in case of lease is liable each year for 25 of vehicle value which is defined as 90 of msrp in the model year 60 of msrp the year after and so on one interesting thing i found about nj is that the 6 vehicle sales tax is only due if the vehicle is purchased in the state is that for real do people then buy their cars out of state to avoid it nj sounds like a cool place for car nuts    well 8 income tax is a bit stiff  no you pay either way if you buy out of state you will pay the tax to dmv when you register the car the selling dealer out of state doesnt do it but in state dealers do hey nj doesnt miss any opportunity to hit you with a tax and they sure wouldnt miss a loophole this big and with the cost of insurance it aint a great place for car nuts although i believe our income tax rate is well below 8 at least the effective rate is maybe that is the top tier marginal rate they make up for no personal property tax on cars by having killer property taxes on your house but at least no sales tax on clothes hmmm nj taxes they are but a fond memory i had the bad timing to lease a 2002 530i in the spring of 2002 while still living in new jersey they charge sales tax on the depreciated portion of the car ie the difference between the negotiated price of the car and the calculated residual fortunately for me i got the car via the ed program and as such i only had to pay sales tax on about 14000 the unfortunate part was that i moved up here to new hampshire not three months later where there is no sales tax on cars or any other sales tax for that matter however there is a vehicle tax applied by our town each year when you register it so i got dinged for nearly 1000 twice in 2002  of course its still pretty easy to justify living up here consider the following  even with njs high property taxes our property taxes went down about 3000 per year by moving up here advantage nh\\n our car insurance dropped about 500 per year advantage nh\\n car tax difference are a wash for the first year of ownership and then anywhere from 500 to 1200 annually for any makemodelyear of vehicle that im likely to want to drive advantage nj balancing out the above three items i figure that we are about 1500 ahead by living in new hampshire even with the annual vehicle tax then again we dont have any sales taxes or income taxes on anything but dividends so taking these last two items into the equation means big time advantage nh best regards\\nshipo then again we dont have any sales taxes or income taxes on anything but dividends so taking these last two items into the equation means big time advantage nh with those kind of taxes i dont only want to buy a car in new hampshire but also immigrate there then again we dont have any sales taxes or income taxes on anything but dividends so taking these last two items into the equation means big time advantage nh with those kind of taxes i dont only want to buy a car in new hampshire but also immigrate there live free or die baby live free or die glad i dont live in ma or the other 30 states 2050 40 i guess you could say mostor say a slight majority have taxes based on value as far as car insurance with a clean driving record you do okay here just dont have any claims against you or your vehicle fifteen years and still strong kudos for the bmw 3 series car and driver looking back on the posts if you were trying to suggest that folks who live in states who determine taxes by msrp take it on the chin by acquiring high value carsi guess they do the either have to pony up the taxes or move the responses oh there werent any speak to the number of people who actually drive these vehicles poseurs well of course and my point is theres nothing wrong with driving a car because you look good in it  it says here but those who work their cars and keep them for awhile fit into a different category does anyone who posts here want to be in that category im guessing    no being seen in whatever vehicle work parking lot or commuting is the real deal im going to guess    yes the responses oh there werent any speak to the number of people who actually drive these vehicles poseurs well of course and my point is theres nothing wrong with driving a car because you look good in it  it says here but those who work their cars and keep them for awhile fit into a different category does anyone who posts here want to be in that category im guessing    no being seen in whatever vehicle work parking lot or commuting is the real deal im going to guess    yes what are you talking about honestly the post this is connected to doesnt seem to gel with your sudden outburst i did some research and found this post 5019 cdnpinhead entrylevel luxury performance sedans 5019 12 dec 2005 625 pm have three requirements for my lux or nearlux car 1 manual transmission 2 rearwheel drive 3 must carry my bicycle inside really big back seat folddown seatbacks or avant stylethe only three lux or nearlux vehicles on the planet that meet my requirements are the bmw 3 the bmw 5 and the g35 coupe wtf maybe a 5 or 3 wagon could hold a bike a g35 coupe did you try that i cant see how thats possible given the fact the g35s trunk is tiny and its backseat is a torture chamber given that i compromised and added the is250 no folddown seat the a4 avant awd  the a3 frontwheel drive to my matrix the a4 avant a3 and matrix seem realistic might as well go mazda3  better handling than the other 3 and much better manual shifter too the is250 simply makes no sense given your bike requirementthe backseat in the is250350 is a joke ctsagain this seems weird with your bike requirement fwiw i think the cts and is250350 handle like pigs is this what you wanted ive driven all the cars you mentioned some not at wagons though although it makes me cringe to actually agree with blueguy  i do agree that your list of cars is odd considering your original requirements especially the g35 coupe fwiw i have a 04 325i sedan i have the winter package that includes the folddown seats and i have carried my bicycle a number of times with the seats folded down  it fits quite well although it helps if i pull the seat post out as well as removing the front wheel in the winter that builtin ski bag is really a nice feature and will hold two pairs of crosscountry skis without having to fold the seats down one other feature notable for bicyclists and others the e46 at least has builtin roofrack mounting points i bought a thule rack made especially for this car so when my wife and i are going somewhere together to ride it just takes a few short minutes to put the rack on with both bikes im not sure if the e90 has these mounts  its not something thats listed in the brochures and i even owned the car for a while before i discovered them im not sure if the e90 has these mounts  its not something thats listed in the brochures and i even owned the car for a while before i discovered them yes the e90 has the same type of mounting points as the previous e46 i have no idea if they are the same sizespacing but the e90 has them looking back on the posts if you were trying to suggest that folks who live in states who determine taxes by msrp take it on the chin by acquiring high value carsi guess they do the key is not high value but inflated msrp eg two cars both selling for 38k or leasing for 550mo    they have the same value but if one has an msrp of 55k and the others is 40k there is a significant difference in the tax due despite the identical market price its the same reason why i hate large mailin rebates at local retailers the consumers end up paying much higher sales tax rate insurance thats a point we can comiserate nj and ma have some the highest insurance rates in the country arizona can play too thousands of cars are stolen regularly and sent elsewhere itd be unpc to mention where point being they arent recovered az insurance rates which ive been told are among the highest in the country are driven primarily by theft  also by accidents resulting from a wide variety of drivers from everywhere oh boy the key is not high value but inflated msrp youre splitting hairs inflated msrp implies a value judgement buying a car is a value judgment the price is the price it costs what it costs to you the consumer hi im 50ish  a recent empty nester i typically keep a car around 1012 years have had buick sedans but am now ready for a bit of fun i mostly drive 12 miles a day straight down 1 street to work  back boring i know with a little more driving over the weekend i was looking hard at 04  05 bmw 330is loved the drive but thought the interior lacked some of the pleasantries that most all cars have these days even my 95 buick i love the exterior of the g35 coupe and thought it was really fun to drive but it seemed so noisy when i sat in the back seat now im looking hard at the lexus is250 and i like it a lot ive also looked at an acura tsx i really am trying to stay in a smaller car no longer than the tsxs 183 anyone have any other ideas as to what i should look at check out the cadillac cts  the mercedes c230 with those included your shopping list will look much like mine if youre buying something soon  dont want a manual transmission which i do give the lincoln ls a look as with other american cars the msrp  even the invoice is merely a suggestion  5  8k off is the rule rather than the exception have fun i thought the caddy cts was too big and i think i thought the lincoln ls was too but ill go look again i was hoping the new lincoln zephyr would be smaller than it is why is it so hard for me to find a small luxury semisporty car luckily my regal is running just fine  im in no hurry weve gotten spoiled having had no car payments for quite a long time maybe i should just drive the ole girl till she gives in acura tl is350 or new mercedes c350 if you prefer sporty semiluxury the bmw and g35 may be the better choice i think youll be hard pressed to find many options under your length requirement of 183 my limit is 188 due to my garage so length is one of the first dimensions i check i guess it depends on your definition of luxury are you looking for a luxury nameplate or just luxurious amenities like leather and power everything in addition to the mercedes cclass and bmw 3series the volvo s40 and audi a3 would meet your size requirement i personally would be concerned with the reliability of those options and would lean more toward your choices from lexus and acura if youre willing to do a coupe you may want to look at the rsx too if you just want leather and other goodies you may want to consider a mazda 3 a subaru impreza or a saab 92x which is basically a gussiedup impreza each of these can be had with leather sunroof upgraded audio etc while still meeting your length requirement if a shorter length is truly a requirement you may also want to consider a small suv i know its probably blasphemy here and probably belongs on a different forum butseveral choices would meet your requirement and add cargo capacity too my two cents the is250 is absolutely hands down the most attractive car on the list best of luck and happy car hunting greg hi greg it is a challenge finding something under 183 i guess i can go larger i just dont want to  my car now is 193  i just like the smaller ones i dont care about a luxury nameplate  i just like the amenities like leather  xenon lights  maybe the builtin garage door opener and i want illuminated radio controls on my steering wheel my old buick has those but my hubbys new maximas are not illuminated i just cant do an suv i havent driven the volvo s40 yet but i will  it looks kinda cute my exbrotherinlaw just retired from being pretty high up at ford  he told me to stay away from the volvo he recommends the is i didnt like the dash on the saab 93 but ill surf now  look at the 92x you mentioned as well as the mazda  subaru i looked at the rsx but felt it was a little too barebones for me the tsx is probably just right for me but the looks of the is just make me drool my dad had a hona prelude a hundred years ago  i wish they still made that actually id really like to find a fake 55  57 tbird that is a modern car under the shell susan you should look at the jetta too the sporty gli version just won a comparison test in car and driver beating the tsx and others the 20t version is the most luxurious model the gli is not in the same league as anything in the entry lux class its a sloppy handling understeering rollypolly corolla lookalike with typical vw engineering ie bad igo said the currentgeneration g35 coupe remains in the lineup for at least a year while the g35 sedan will be replaced after this model year infiniti plans to preview the new g35 sedan in april at the new york auto show he added besides the success with record sales infiniti also has a new lower average age of its buyers 150 46 igo said this is the lowest of all luxury brands it146s also 6 years younger than the average age of infiniti buyers a few years earlier\\nindeed the g35 coupe outsold the bmw 3series coupe in 2005 igo said\\nigo reminded reporters that this year marks the start of a renovation of infiniti dealerships which have maintained their look since infiniti was launched more than 15 years ago the first fully renovated dealership will be completed this summer in phoenix he said\\nhe projected infiniti146s us sales to be about flat in calendar 2006 with the 136401 sales of calendar 2005 some of this will be due to the changeout of the 2006 g35 sedan with the new 2007 model the g35 sedan is infiniti146s topselling car the g35 coupe is the second bestselling car httpautoshowmsncomasarticlercautoshow2006 more g coupe concept pics including interior here httpwwwnissannewscom the gli is not in the same league as anything in the entry lux class its a sloppy handling understeering rollypolly corolla lookalike with typical vw engineering ie bad but seriously blueguy what do you really think of the gli they know revealing the g35 sedan too soon will spoil sales of the 2006s argh the g35 coupe addresses some visual issues i had with the original  namely the lack of a character line wow stunning seriously stunning oh april is so far away i was expecting more of the concept theyve shown it looks like a warmed over version or a facelift of the current g35 coupe to me i like the new front end but the rear more or less looks the same to me now that interior is a night and day difference to the current car even when they tone it down for production it will be way better than current m anyone have any other ideas as to what i should look at suburu legacy gt i had a 2004 maxima i wanted a little more luxury i drove the 2006 mercedes c350 three times ordered one and put a 4000 deposit on it in september it was still not built as of 123105 my neighbor suggested i look at the 2006 vw passat 36l i laughed at him but went for a test drive anyway it was equal to or better than the mercedes across the board and 10000 less to boot i got my deposit back from mercedes and bought the vw on 1506 best decision i ever made thank you mercedes for not building my car great that you are happy with the passat 36l mb does have delays in building the c350mine too took about 3 monthsbut hey to me it was definitely worth it i am over 4800 blazing miles now you are just the type of buyer vw wants one who looked at the higher priced german iron and found it to be lacking for whatever reason then purchases a vw passat i just wonder if there are enough of you to make the passat the volume seller vw wants it to be well actually there are two groups you who looked up mb and didnt buy then there is the group that looked down  hondatoyota etc and found those brands lacking and deceided to spend more money on a vw very risky strategy for vw imo but i see the new passat everday now many of them m some more pics the more i see this car the more i like it the profile is so sleek im beginning to warm up to the tail lights as well httpshowsautospiescomgalleryshowsaspmanucatthispage39galleryid32  httpshowsautospiescomgalleryshowsaspmanucatthispage38galleryid32  my guesses g30 30l 260 hp v6 31000

a sloppy handling understeering rollypolly corolla lookalike with typical vw engineering ie bad but seriously blueguy what do you really think of the gli you call that thinking not a word of it is true tell it to car and driver who consider the gli tops in its class who buys a car based on what c  d thinks c  d is just a magazine i dont buy based on reviews i buy based on how the car responds to me drive the car for yourself unfortunately i experienced the displeasure of driving a gli and its exactly as i described it in my extensive review posted months ago great engine great tranny lousy handling theyve improved it from the last gli with the cruddy 6 speed and lousy vr6 at least maybe by gen vi they can make a gli that doesnt drive like a pillbug on wheels i just drove it yesterday  handling is great very taut instant torque a real pleasure i only quote car  driver because they get cars together and compare sidebyside which is hard for consumers to do and theyre performanceoriented but want luxury too like me i would like to read your review though just for laughs i guess we can add handling to the list of subjective characteristics one mans very taut is someone elses pillbug on wheels quoting edmunds first drive test\\nhighspeed stability was excellent when the road does turn the electromechanical steering is tight and sporty offering excellent feedback and feel and the suspension which has thicker antiroll bars gives the car a hunkereddown planted feeling in the corners push too hard and radical understeer rears its ugly head but the car is easy to drive quickly and much more fun than we thought it would be i didnt push hard enough to induce understeer but otherwise i agree sorry no mention of pillbug well i just drove the 06 gti here are my impressions nice fit and finish decent interior power in the gti with 18s package 1 and dsg was ample dsg was just as fun and snappy as ever unfortunately the car sits too high and the suspension causes too much understeer in hard cornering nosedive was ample in corners and the car due to the inherent problems of fwd couldnt pull out of corners fast enough for me overall a nice car good power great tranny but ultimately far too soft for my liking bummer i wanted to like it as it was last hope i didnt push hard enough to induce understeer but otherwise i agree sorry no mention of pillbug thats hilarious you admittedly drove the car sedately and then come back at me for tearing down the cars high speed performance characteristics as someone else mentioned one mans taunt car is anothers sloppy jallopy the 06 gli for people who drive as if medicated will feel tight and fun i tend to push my cars far more the end result then most cars to me feel undrivable on my drive of the gti the salesman was shocked that i didnt like the car he commented that nobody on his test drives has pushed the car as hard as i or as smoothly he actually wanted to know if i race in autox or semiprofessionally he expected i would have liked it given the way i drove it nope it cant hold a candle to what i drive now or several other cars think of it this way if you eat quality steaks and seafood daily then a stop at outback seems quaint but not worth enduring on a day to day basis our us spec gtis get the watered down rasied suspension to meet federal bumper height requirements and possibly soften up the ride for american tastes the general publicnot most nuts like us who post here was the gti better than the gli yeah a bit tighter than the gli its a really tall vehicle for something thats not very big like you slide across into a seat rather than dropping down into one odd almost suvish still i think i may be too hard on cars v others so you might see the gti as an utter blast shrug of the golf platform cars i liked the a3 the most still i feel my my affection for aduivw will have to stop at the dsg20 i dont think i can ever go back to fwd even something as mundane as a freeway onramp is a source of great fun in a rwd car basically after driving only my 3 daily for 6 months not including rentals for business trips i think ill never get another fwd car basically after driving only my 3 daily for 6 months not including rentals for business trips i think ill never get another fwd car  heartily agree if you are still looking look at the saab 93 20 t this thing is a blast to drive everything i have read say the reliablity is excellent on all the 05 and 06s and after reading tons of consumer reviews this is the car we like best great buy if you are still looking look at the saab 93 20 t this thing is a blast to drive everything i have read say the reliablity is excellent on all the 05 and 06s and after reading tons of consumer reviews this is the car we like best great buy not a very costefficient buy however the rapid depreciation on saabs is horrific if you plan on buying one also plan on keeping it a loooong time and driving it until it dies i came really close to buying an 05 330i i like the old style 3series over the new but for just everyday driving to work  back 7 miles down 1 street i really would like more interior niceties than bmw offers in the 3series at that price range it seems to me that a car these days should have a cd changer and any sort of security system the g35 coupe is my favorite on the exterior and i loved how it handled but the one i drove had a lot of wind noise that i think would drive me crazy after a while i wonder if it was just that 1 car  maybe i should go back  try again right now its between the tsx  is250 tl is longer than i want fortunately i want to buy in the spring or summer or even fall so hopefully the price on the is will come down a bit i feel like i should go with the tsx because of its value but it doesnt excite me the way the is did i tend to keep my cars a solid 10 years or so  i dont want to buy one and later feel any buyers remorse forgo the cds all together get an ipod copy your songs as 256 kbps mp3s sto it boomno more cd clutter no more searching for songs and now you have everything available in one click btw when the blazes are the entry lux class cars going to get indashflashramequipped music drives the lexus ls460 is finally getting one but why is this simple tech taking so long to trickle down of the buying market who would use it the lexus lss target group doesnt seem as tech savvy as the entry lux class buyers does the rapid depreciation make it a better car to lease or does that make it worse if the residuals reflect real life it will make it worse if the leasing company sets the residuals unrealistically high then it will make it better lower payment saab tends to do the latter making their cars relatively cheap to lease relative to their msrps regards\\nkyfdx\\nhostprices paid forums i really would like more interior niceties than bmw offers in the 3series at that price range it seems to me that a car these days should have a cd changer and any sort of security system a cd changer can be had for the 3er fairly inexpensively that being said why mess with a changer at all for my money ill get an ipod and plug it into the aux port regarding the comment about the security system you do know that all recent bmws since 1999 at the very least have been equipped with a very sophisticated and comprehensive antitheftsecurity system dont you true the e90 lacks an audible alarm but who really cares about that it146s simply a device that simply pisses everybody off anywhere within earshot and doesnt deter a thief one bit that being said for the very reasonable price of 23205 from pacificbmwcom a fully integrated and easily installable alarm can be purchased personally ive had one bmw with the standard setup and one with the full alarm package ill skip the alarm next time around best regards\\nshipo more and more car makers are supporting ipod integration they might as well be done with it and just put docks in the things regarding the comment about the security system you do know that all recent bmws since 1999 at the very least have been equipped with a very sophisticated and comprehensive antitheftsecurity system dont you true the e90 lacks an audible alarm but who really cares about that it146s simply a device that simply pisses everybody off anywhere within earshot and doesnt deter a thief one bit that being said for the very reasonable price of 23205 from pacificbmwcom a fully integrated and easily installable alarm can be purchased to build on what shipo said about the 3series their antitheft includes an ignition imobilizer basically you cant start the car unless you have the little computer chip thats stored in the key if someones breaking into your car to steal something inside of it then an audible alarm wont scare them off at all theyll just grab what they want cds money bags etc and run btw most people just ignore alarms going off in parking lots dont you p  if they really want to steal the car then bmws system is extremely effective in preventing that if they really want to steal the car then bmws system is extremely effective in preventing that absolutely correct to help further illustrate this point back in 1999 when i moved from a 1995 passat glx to a much more expensive 1999 328i my car insurance went down not that im complaining mind you i told my insurance agent but why because our experience with bmws is that they are very hard to steal and as such we have very few payouts for that type of loss thinking about this another way ive been active on the 3series and 5series discussions since mid1998 and in that entire time i can only remember one car that was reported to have been stolen apparently it was picked up and put on a flatbed or into a trailer and this was a car with the alarm system installed in the end if a professional thief wants your car heshe will get it and no alarmlojackonstar system will prevent its loss period full stop the end best regards\\nshipo if im remembering the same incident you are i believe the owner eventually decided that someone at the dealership had illegally gotten a key and either stole the vehicle himself or passed the key on the person who did not much a security system can do about that ah yes you did indeed jog my memory there was speculation about flat bedding the car when it was first stolen but youre right in the end it was determined to be the key situation you described blush i was confusing that scenario with one the my kid brother had at about the same time where his yukon complete with onstar got nicked the toronto police told him that it was most likely already on a boat and headed for russia securely inside the same shielded as in impervious to lojack and onstar signals container box that it was stuffed into right out of the hotel parking lot funny thing about that one the car was recovered a year later in indiana hmmm last time i checked indiana was a long way from moscow  best regards\\nshipo for just everyday driving to work  back 7 miles down 1 street i really would like more interior niceties than bmw offers in the 3series i was just going to let that pass but its been bugging me for a 7 mile drive on the same street i dont think id be real concerned about niceities after all how long does it take  10 minutes one thing about a bmw especially the 3 series is the way the interior is put together doesnt actually become obvious until you live with the car a while then you start to appreciate the way everything is at hand and is where it should be  the way everything is designed as a package and not parts just thrown together makes ownership appreciate as you drive it a bmw is for driving anyway not for looking at shades amen i can be driving 500 miles or 5 blocks and i eagerly look forward to that drive a 7 mile drive  7 miles of fun he obviously looks at cars differently i hope one day i never view my car as just transportation lifes too short a bmw is for driving anyway not for looking at a concise explanation of bmws current design philosophy not interested in either car at anytime i was just curious about what you thought i respect your opinionthats all howd you like that 130i reviewed in roundel pretty sweet a bmw is for driving anyway not for looking at what say idrive what say idrive i drive you drive we all drive idrive is an option and furthermore its easy to use sorry but every complaint about idrive reminds me of the people who complain about tivo or meesenger or any other product that will take a person 12 minutes to understand on a surface level idrive is an option and furthermore its easy to use sorry but every complaint about idrive reminds me of the people who complain about tivo or meesenger or any other product that will take a person 12 minutes to understand on a surface level the version of idrive in the 2002 7series was fairly difficult to use now however idrive is so intuitive to anyone that uses a desktoplaptop computer i think people just have preconceived ideas about idrive based on what they heard 5 years ago and immediately judge it without even trying it its easy to use now after many changes that too when the car is standing still bmws are cars to be driven last thing you want to do is open a laptop and start going through menus anyway this is my opinion and could well be different from yours however i havent seen many people i know who love the idrive in their bimmers conversely if bmw didnt incorporate new technology in its cars their competitors would pass them buy a doubleedged sword the funny thing is though that many the other luxury car makers are following bmws lead and putting in their own version of idrive notice how many other luxury marques are doing the whole joystick thing funny how bmw takes the heat 34 years early then everyone else follows along acura \\ninfiniti \\naudi \\nbmw looking for a midsized midpriced or lessluxury sedan most importantly has to be excellent in the snow good gas mileage would be a plus not too picky on bells and whistles thank you it would help me to suggest something if you define what midpriced or less means as a range without any other information some ideas would be subaru legacy not too much luxury though imo\\ninfiniti g35x\\nacura tsx or tl\\nlexus is awd\\naudi a4 quattro i think id like to keep it under 40k im not really a car afficianado usually buy a car and hold it for many years currently have a saab 93 but it is terrible in the snow even with snow tires perhaps i should get a young used low mileage vehicle rather than a new one being that im not a car person thanks ron if you want something simple nice good in the snow with limited luxury and back seat room a subaru legacy or legacy gt might be a good choice and they tend to last a long time they are not considered a luxury brand but aspire to be one but a very solid car and the gt is quite powerfulfun to drive main issues for me were subpar gas mileage smaller backseat and design was a little on the plain side although tasteful and simple this was my second choice to the acura tl tl was a better value proposition to me even though it cost more i liked the design features back seat room etc snow was not an issue in my purchase though luxury is a bit of a tough word to me now because nonluxury cars are more and more incorporating features that are generally considered luxury look at a full loaded accord v6 with nav vs acura tl or lexus es and you will see what i mean to me main differences are design quality based on taste material quality and tuning of engine suspension steering etc the specifics of luxury are not too important to me i do want luxury though and pretty much anything in the luxury category could fit the bill i plan on making a short list and seeing what makes sense a4 quattro avant with either engine\\na3 quattro with the 32 is a good choice too as others have mentioned 325xi do eurodelivery and youll get it for less than most of its competitors\\ng35x\\nis250 awd\\nrl can pick them up for under 40k and theyre really really nice should i be sticking with the awd vehicles is there a downside to awd what about four wheele drive  thanks fourwheeldrive as opposed to allwheeldrive is strictly for serious offroad lowrange rock crawling though it can be used in high range for the same sorts of things awd is good for the difference has to do with such arcane things as interaxle  limitedslip differentials im guessing you couldnt care less awd is automatic and is generally the best choice for those who are mostly concerned with highway traction as opposed to offroad stuff subaru is the reigning king of this but if you want luxury however you define it  theres lots of bickering potential here the bmw  audi options are good ones and some are willing to admit that the infiniti g can play too ive spent quite a bit but not nearly enough of my life in colorado and i can assure you that the most common vehicle driven by locals in the high country above 8000 feet  say winter parkfrasergranby is the subaru audi has been doing this longer than anyone and has the best bar none interiors in the business even if you dont know what luxury means after youve sat in an audi youll at least have a starting point ive been reading at a different edmunds forum that audi more the a4 is not as reliable as it should be and it may lack a bit of power is this accurate should i be sticking with the awd vehicles is there a downside to awd for most people its not really an issue but 1 with awd you get a slight loss in power and performance because engine power is split between all wheels as opposed to just two wheels 2 some people dont like the awkward feeling of the backandforth between oversteer and understeer 3 awd almost always results in lower gas mileage than the same car with 2wd 4 awd will almost always be more expensive than the same car with 2wd i could be forgetting some things regardless im not trying to make a case against awd because i had an audi a4 quattro and loved the awd system you just wanted to also know the disadvantages good point those 4 pictures are worth 40000 words i wouldnt get awd unless i needed it but living in a climate where lately a 2 foot snowfall is not out of the question awd is a good investment there have been arguments back and forth pro and con but my experience tells me awd is the ultimate winner for safe and efficient trave the 20t makes 200 hp and 207 ftlbs of torque at 1800 rpm all the way to 5000 rpm imho its a better engine than the nissan vq bmw inline 6 and toyotas lousy 2535s from the is250350 great peppy smooth hard charging little 20t blows away the competition imho have had bad experiences with cars in snow honda and saab both front wheele drive and would like a sedan that can handle the snow i live in massachusetts is an awd the way to go or is there another option or is there a front wheele drive vehicle that can get the job done have you tried a set of dedicated snow tires on your cars before my current bmw awd i had snows on a saab and had no problem jaj tried 4 new snows on saab 93 and still scared me in snow first tried two in front which did nothing the four only marginally improved situation i live just north of you in southern new hampshire and ran winter tires on my rwd 530i with great results in fact ill go so far as to say that it was the best winter ride ive ever had best nonwinter ride as well while ive never had a fwd car with winter tires i can only assume that a fwd saab so shod would do pretty darn well in the white stuff so given your experience a couple of things come to mind 1 you had crummy snow tires or\\n2 you need to consider relocating to florida  best regards\\nshipo i agree with shipo we have an 04 93 convertible with goodyear snow tires its a tank ion the white stuff not quite sure what the guy is expecting out of curiosity how long have you been driving in snow ive driven fwd wall seasons basically all my life with no real incidents to report this includes regular ski trips to me vt and nh the bridgestone allseason tires on my 05 tl are not very good in the snow and will be replaced but traction aids snow driving sense and luck have gotten me there safely any fwd wdecent snows should more than suffice for ne winters for going forward awd with snows would be the ultimate i know there is no shortage of disappointing reviews about the lexus is350 but the paragraph below from the wall street journal sums up the is350 quite nicely that can be a plus for a big luxury car but in a sport sedan we expect a seatofthe pants feeling and we didnt get it from the is 350 were tempted to blame that on such features as the lexuss electronic throttle which uses sensors on the gas pedal and computerized engine controls to replace the cable that usually connects the drivers foot to the engine or maybe its the fact that the is 350 isnt available with a manual transmission we had a lot of fun driving a bmw 3 series with its manual option but those answers seem too simple after all weve enjoyed driving cars with automatics  or even models with too much electronic wizardry  when a winning vehicle lies beneath the gadgets somehow the is just doesnt hang together to create what wed call a drivers car that sums up the is350 decent car but not a drivers car by any means been driving in ne 30 yrs have no problem in wifes oddessey a prior forum comment may have been right on with the suggestion of a better set of snows thanks httpwwwautobilddetestneuwagenartikelphpartikel_id10563 for the german speaking very interesting comparison test between lexus is 250 and bmw 325\\ndoes lexus build better 3 series to sum things up \\n1 the 3 is a bit quicker 0100kmh in 73 instead of 81 the is engine is a bit strained\\n2 it offers more mpg by 1015\\n3 its ride is more comfortable lexus had 18 inch tires the lexus is 1500 euro cheaper do you really think the 35 from toyota is lousy\\ndid you test drive the is350 the reason i am asking you is i am waiting for toyota to introduce the gs350 because it seems like something i would be intrested in the current awd drive version of the gs is very sluggish in my estimation as well as the 530xi from bmw audis a6 42 awd seems like the way to go but when all the options are added its gets a bit pricey if this upcoming gs 350 is a slug i will be very disappointed i agree with you most other lux carmakers are following bmw with idrive kind of interfaces and letting bmw take the heat imo technology just for the sake of technology serves no one i am a big bmw fan and plan to buy my first this year spring just dont like some of the things that have happened in the past few years in these segments new age style included i think the e90 is the best design to come out of bmw since bangle took over again my opinion do you really think the 35 from toyota is lousy fast fairly smooth engine nothing to write home about did you test drive the is350 yes felt it was soft steering didnt communicate well to the driver had lousy seats poor visibility tranny was horrible and the car understeered like a fwd vehicle if this upcoming gs 350 is a slug i will be very disappointed itll be fast im not interested in merely fast i want a sharp handling involving drive the is350 was neither i gothcha blueguy for me fast is priority because i have something to prove handling must also be up there but i wouldnt break my neck to get formula one handling how much handling do i need on the i95 you can only go so fast on the freeway back roads in the woods and onoff ramps but with great handling those ramps the back streets and the roads in the middle of nowhere become heavenly handling wins over power if i can get both ill take it for now im driving the best compromise ive found ideally bmw will release a 335i soon and i can get the power bump i long for this may seem like a dumb question but i really dont know a lot about luxury sport sedans i was curious as to whether or not a dvd based navigation system can play dvds i mean it would make sense to me that they wouldi was looking at a g35 coupe on ebay that showed kill bill playing on the navigation screen but he modified his system so his xbox could play through it and he might be playing the dvd through the xbox see it here httpcgiebaycomebaymotorsinfinitig352003vortechsuperchargedg35coupe 6speed_w0qqitemz4606845482qqcategoryz43914qqrdz1qqcmdzviewitem i just think when you pay 2000 extra for a 7 screen in your car it should do a little more than tell you where to go i agree with blue you dont always use available power but handling comes into play on every inch of the road just my opinion and preference how much handling do i need on the i95 on my piece of i95 nj tpk i am constantly dodging various junk strewn on the road 2 x 4s steel brackets padlocks broomhandles yaddy yadda plus when you use 18wheelers poky camrys and tardy town cars as pylons handling rules  i was curious as to whether or not a dvd based navigation system can play dvds no as far as i know there are not any factoryequipped dvd navigation systems that also play movies for luxury sport sedans the infiniti m does in the optional journey package i think you can only watch movies on the navigation screen when the car is in park though but you can get a res for the back seat of the m i would agree w bdr127 i have a c280 w awd i am guessing i lose 23mpg vs rwd i took a recent road trip and only averaged 275 mpg cruising 75 many will argue that rdw or fwd is all you need and not without merit my preference was to sacrifice the 23mpg and power yes it is a noticable difference if you drive with any spirit w rwd or fwd you will do much better w snow tires you will likely be better off with tires designed for ice and snow than ms or as for winter driving assuming you keep it on the road although they often have a softer tread compound making them wear quicker i have not really noticed a back and forth oversteerundersteer  or maybe im just used to it as i have been driving 4wd and awd for years and may unconsciously compensate for it or use it to my advantage cost is a disadvantage although the level of the impact can be argued if you choose to run two sets of tires and consider the resale value the awd will have i beleive here has been a whole discussion on that subject cost is also subjective if you are considering multiple vehicles like subaru vs 3series or cseries or whatever im sure that last statement will ruffle feathers but everyone has a different vehicles they will consider ultimately drive em and see what you like ideally bmw will release a 335i soon and i can get the power bump i long for i am not sure they will because one of their most renown sports tuner alpina already offers a 34 liter 300 hp version the e90 version should be out soon http2122274810indexphp the heart of the new bmw alpina b3 s is its inline sixcylinder engine with 34 litre displacement peak performance of 305bhp 224kw is garnered at 6300rpm with maximum torque of 362nm achieved at 4800rpm 90 of available torque is at your command from 2500rpm to 6500rpm making driving a daily occurrence dont know why alpina is so little known in the us i agree with blueguydotcom the is350 is one fast ride the suspension was too soft the car pitched and rolled the brake pedal was soft speed is last on my performance list in ny the highways are crawling with cops and when theyre not traffic is terrible it would be nice but isnt necessary i got back into my 01 prelude type sh after driving the is350 and despite its serious horsepower  torque deficiencies is a much more fun to drive car dont have any interest in aftermarket tuners the 35 and or 30tt bmw is supposed to produce soon should do the trick dont have any interest in aftermarket tuners do you consider amg or the motorsport division of bmw as such if yes then naturally alpina who works basically the same way with bmw cant be of any interest to you maybe should bmw shoehorn a 4l v8 to make for a 340 but it would be too close to the m3 i heard that the 6in line has limitations that make pushing to 35l displacement difficult amg i have no use forits mb afterall as for m its an actual division of bmw alpina is not alpina is like dinan just a tuner i want nothing to do with alpina is like dinan just a tuner i want nothing to do with how can you compare alpina to dinan do you know many bmwbased brands that can be bought and serviced in the bmw network in europe\\ndinan just makes some aftermaket tuning pieces whereas alpina has its cars built on bmw lines and fit with their powertrains in their own factory engine is individually signed by the engineer in charge alpina dont sell upgrade chip and can not sell performance upgrade for second hand bmw the b5 they are making is considered as the most serious rival to the m5 with the benefit of extra exclusivity http2122274810downloadstestberichteen1118397377autocar_05_2005pdf it is true they dont have a strong offer for the e90 except a diesel that makes 23 mpg at 125 mph you dont want alpina this is your choice but pls dont compare alpina to an aftermarket tuner even if the latter is expensive  anyway it is your choice but alpina cant be compared to hartge or schnitzer or even brabus i would not compare dinan with alpina dinan is a tuner alpina is professional engineering company\\nbut i have to disagree with remark regarding inline six limitations\\njust take a look at inline 6 tvrs engines\\nhere is the spec for some of them\\n36l 350bhp torque290 ftlbs\\n4l 380bhp torque349 ftlbs sport car international has a comparo between the is350 g35 c350 and 330i when i saw the story i just knew how the cars would rank 330i is350 g35 and c350 however the actual ranking turned out to be 330i c350 is350 and g35 in that order from first to last i couldnt believe it at a glance the is350 beat all others in acceleration and build quality but didnt cut it in when it came to driving lack of character and the highest astested price were the gripes they say its the kind of car youd recommend to a friend but wouldnt want yourself m thankfully a bmw 330i was used in the comparison i was all excited about buying a bmw 325xi touring i test drove the 3 series touring many months ago and was amazed at how slugish it performed my view was confirmed by two bmw325xit reviews from national post and a british car magazine called autocar both testers achieved 60mph in 80 seconds ouch in canada they are currently selling a 06 bmw e90 323i with a 170 hp 25l engine  my 99 e46 bmw323i has 170 hp and accomplished 60mph in less than 80 seconds unfortunately the current 06 e90 323is gets to 60mph in 80 seconds ouch i know i know you buy bmws for their handling but is such sluggish performance from a company like bmw acceptable imho the answer is no\\n_ here is a provactive comment there are essentially two cars in this segment to buy from all others are a waste unless you get an incredible deal agree or disagree 1 bmw 3 series price the 325xi to a comparable mercecedes c240 or audi a4 20 and you find best value for what it offers especially with new maintenance program that effectively brings the price down a bit more and if you opt for leatherette in price comparison i like audi but not discounted sufficiently for its poorer record in quality and lower resale value comparably equipped car is only slightly cheaper and not worth the savings audi and mercedes dont have a single attribute over the 3 series in this category though i prefer e o4 a6 to 5 series and s or a8 to 7series 2 acura tl it is a blah car but great quality power and interior no option pricing reliable reasonably stylish g35 was the other car in this segment but i cant see what the g35 has over the new tl and again the tl is close in price so why go inifiniti if you love infiniti beg borrow and steal to get into the m35 volvo s60  not comparable underpowered weaker quality image etc\\nsaab 93  nice but a level under and comparable to a tsx\\nlexus i350  not fun cheap looking interior to me nothing compelling\\ninfiniti g35  buy the tl for same power and nicer quality g35 coupe would be an exception for this rule if you are coupe person\\naudi a4 again buy the 3 series for slightly more and make it back in service coverage resale value and quality also interior is great quality but seems dated bmw now has a reasonably proficient 4wheel drive system so quatro less key\\nmercedes c too expensive too many cut corners buy the e used or go for the bmw\\ncadillac  not a bad car but not compelling not cheap enough\\nlincolen zephyr  same price as any of the above and weaker than all of them i cant see what the g35 has over the new tl ummm how about rwd vs fwd thats a big one in my book big enough that if i had to choose between these two id pick the infiniti best regards\\nshipo good point but then you could nearly get a nearly comparable 325 just go leatherette and you sacrifice some power but gain in handling and weight distribution i live in a snow belt and drive a 328 in snow with traction control but i have not been as impressed with the g35 in bad weather and at the limits so id go tl though before the new one was out i might have gone g35x and had the best of both worlds love that car just dont like the interior quality my point was only comparing the g35 and the tl if you want to throw bmw into the mix then id certainly choose that instead of either of the other two btw with the bmw i would much rather get a rwd sp version and winter tires as opposed to the xi which is how i set my 530i up for the snow we get around here year round performance whats not to like shades best regards\\nshipo hi from dallas ive been driving a regal grand sport fwd for 13 years and am finally ready for a new car everything i like is rwd being in dallas i obviously dont need to concern myself with snow issues but i do want to feel comfortable in wet conditions  the occasional icy drive home from work i like the is g35  330i im a 50ish female with a light foot pretty much just drive back  forth to work 7 miles each way  not much highway driving do you think ill be ok with a rwd thanks good point but then you could nearly get a nearly comparable 325 just go leatherette and you sacrifice some power but gain in handling and weight distribution why would anyone give up almost 2 seconds 060 mph class leading interior space tractor like traction with the awd rwd biased handling in normal traction situations and luxury touches like keyless igntion and reclining rear seating thats why i drive the g35x because the new 3 series is the class leader yes youll be fine with rwd even north of dallas just remember that when the weather is bad rain snow ice etc just drive like there is an egg under your brake and accelerator pedals easy does it  and  keep moving sometimes you cant avoid it but try to gauge traffic and if the roads are slick try to drive so that you dont actually come to a full stop i live in the north have never put snowtireschains on my cars and have never been stuck if it is really horrible dont go out otherwise drive carefully and remember that just because you can go doesnt automatically mean you can stop for all you four wheel drivers in your part of the country i would say buy anthing you want just dont try to drive like crazy ifwhen the weather gets bad pearl thanks for the tips i usually dont go out when the weather is terrible usually its a question of getting home when they let us leave work early because of ice that happens maybe 1 day a year here my speeddemon days are over wish i still had my 71 mustang so i think i will get what i want  not make fwd a criteria i agree that the rwd decision is a nonissue in dallas i mean if you cant drive an rwd car safely yearround in dallas where could you drive one after all im up here in detroit and am doing just fine with a 325i on allseason tires go for the bimmer but i have to disagree with remark regarding inline six limitations sorry i wasnt clear enough i heard that bmw would need to fully redesign a block to make it 35 l instead of 30 the current 30 comes from successive evolutions from the original 25 to 28 then 30\\nshould a 35 be redeveloped the overall block length increase would compromise crash test ratings so it seems 30 is a limitation difficult to overcome in this context\\nif bmw want to switch to v6 increasing displacement will be easier and this is what mb did but straight 6 have some advantages that v6 dont have balance so i prefer straight 6 myself because of this bmw may directly switch to v8 for their top end the current 30 comes from successive evolutions from the original 25 to 28 then 30 ummm no the previous generation of i6 from bmw was as you describe however the i6 that is in the 2006 and later e60s and all e90s is an all new design that came out of the gates at three liters ive never known bmw to design a new engine that didnt have the ability to grow the displacement best regards\\nshipo i said the key is not high value but inflated msrp your response\\nyoure splitting hairs inflated msrp implies a value judgement buying a car is a value judgment the price is the price it costs what it costs to you the consumer no personal value judgement was implied in my use of the term inflated msrp at all inflated msrp means an msrp that is far higher than actual market clearing price for example mb e class with 57k manufacturer lease incentive that indicates an inflated msrp another example\\nboth tl and 95 sell for about 3132k in the market place they are by definition comparable in value yet one of them has an msrp of 39k whereas the other is around 34k the 5k difference is sheer inflated msrp that does not accrue at all in terms of value in more than half of the 50 states the inflated msrp gets taxed every year of a cars ownership the price is the price i dont buy your example of junk economics you pay what you pay i cant believe this dead horse is still being beaten lets stop beating it  can we move on if you say so then no problem\\nwe will see if it works out this way but why dont bmw add a turbo like they did for the earliest 745 i am dreaming of this six in line with a compressor or a turbo with minimum lag if bmw added some direct fuel injection they could even improve economy like volkswagen did for the 20 tfsi\\n300 hp 280 lbf this would make an interesting offer alpina does this but we need to go for the 44 v8 516lbf a real delight on 5 or 7series the comparison that edmunds did on the a4 vs 330 is almost completely different from the recent roadtrack comparo i know they are comparing two different cars in the bimmer catagory but if you look at just numbers and the fact that the a4 for roadtrack was equipped with far better tires it would seem as though the a4 stacks up a little better than edmunds would make out actually a whole lot better\\ngranted the tires are a huge issue and you can go so far as test track conditions to forgive the big disparity thats why its best to drive cars for yourself and make your own judgments\\none other point is that imo audi has a key ingredient that bmw lacks that being a certain driver friendly something where you can drive an audi all day and never get beat up they are much more forgiving as a gt car imo\\nalso sosk i live in houston where we probably get more rain but much less ice a good set of tires for the appropriate season will go a long ways on any car that with adjusting driving habits when the weather turns foul should keep you safe\\nfinally i recommend driving as many of the cars in your needs category as possible to see which one fits you best i would recommend a japanese brand if you intend to keep the car for 13 years as you did your last one\\ngood luck and let us know how you do hi houston thanks for the rec on the tires  ill certainly remember that ive driven so many cars that im almost getting tired of it i still think im leaning towards the is250 i know it doesnt have the power that the is350 has but its got enough for me i liked the tsx but it just doesnt have the wow factor for me and i like a little wow and i must agree on your suggestion to go japanese thanks again for your input check out the latest rt they compared 7 awd sedans i think the is was 2nd or 3rd behind audi and suburu g35x was 6th not aging well they said thought i should sharethis weekend i travelled to bay area from sacramento and obtained the following measurements nonstop distance reading  123 miles\\navg speed reading  70 mpg includes traffic slowdowns and mostly in the 80s and a few rushes to the 100s\\nmpg reading 316\\nroad type about 45 miles of uphill driving rest was flat the car continues to amaze me in either the january or february issue of car and driver they admitted that there was a tie its because the numbers were rounded up because each category was averaged among the editors after review they still managed to rate the 3 series ahead anyone who read the article knows its bs its bs because lexus didnt win or lexus gave the is its best shot and still couldnt manage to unseat the 3 series even with some glitches with the test vehicle or are all comparos where bmw wins bs why are you worrying what a magazine or other posters say about a car you obviously are obsessed with buy it drive it live with it let it be bro itll be what itll be no need to have to defend which is better its all opinion and in my opinion id rather own the 330 so i happened to be on the us trademark website for work and punched in g37 just for the hell of it and lo and behold it came up as being trademarked by nissan on january 26 2006 m37 and fx37 were trademarked on the same date this pretty much confirms that the rumored 37l fz engine is going into the g m and fx and that they will change their moniker to correctly reflect the size of the engine check it out httpwwwusptogovindexhtml who cares how many points cd gave these cars the categories are weighted according to editor preferences read the article decide which characteristics you place a high value on and then see which car wins for you if you want high feature content for the dollar and a powerful motor the lexus is obviously going to rate higher for you if you value chassis dynamics and control feedbackresponse and an mt the bmw is going to rate higher what are you looking for see luxury performance sedans post 6338 to read all about bmws new biturbo 6supposedly to be used in a future 330 this engine will have no noticeable powerlag and 060 time in the 330 will be faster by 05 seconds looks like bmw has done it again my goddaughter just emailed me her analysis of several cars she was considering thought you all might like to see some of her comments for reference shes mid 20s an accomplished athlete graduated last year with a masters degree in biomedical engineering she had been driving an toyota celica and occasionally her older brothers restored alfa graduate but decided it was time to get a new car she and her brother took a skip barbers driving school together about 2 years ago so i guess she qualifies as an enthusiast i am cutting and pasting her comments below ______________________________________ 1st place 330i 6speed overall most fun to drive of the 4 door sedans not a fan of i drive but it was not as bad as i had read unfortunately expensive options and not much price negotiation 2nd place tl 6speed biggest positive surprise handling was better than expected considering front wheel drive nice 6speed that was crisper shifting than even the 330i some torque steer sporty clean interior nice amenities very reasonably priced and no bs option list 3rd place g35 coupe 6speed sedan exterior is a turnoff coupe is much nicer outside but still a dissapointment inside powerful engine but noisy and unrefined at high rpms compared to the 330i and tl close to bmw relative to steering  handling no rear seat headroom 4th place lexus is350 biggest negative surprise no manual transmission not even an smg option what was lexus thinking salesman claimed that i was exactly the target market they were shooting for yeah right girls cant drive sticks i said it looked to me like the target market was testosterone laden guys that have a lead foot and no other driving skills too bad nice powerful engine decent handling best interior but thanks to automatic transmission least fun car to drive 5th place a4 32 attractive but a little bland exterior nice interior performance was hohum felt very heavy reliability an issue 6th place c350 everything 23 rungs below the 330i plus terrible reliability record ill either go for the 330i or perhaps the tl with the idea that if things go well financially i might go for the new m3 in a couple of years what do you think\\n______________________________________ there you have it from one prospecitve buyer who is considerign the entire compact sports sedan market thanks for the comparo i especially enjoyed the lexus i remarks gotta laugh at the newbie salesmans pathetic comment on exact target market the target market usually do not want to be tagged with the targetting eg moms dont want minivans but secure men with large cargo loads do the youth dont want cars targetted at youth but older folks looking for the best bang for the buck do city dwellers dont want softroader crossovers they want the most impractical offroad heavy machines that hardly ever get taken off the road whereas the suburbanites with occasional snow and offroad needs actually dont mind getting the softroaders call it ego or whatever the salesman should have known better interesting but odd sounding designations imo any guess as to what the hp will be over 300 is a given i guess huh m lol youre exactly right about that ive heard that the folks at the new scion brand are upset that their youth brand is being bought by some retireeage customers who see the boxy cars as very economical and practical of course this totally turns off their target market who would not want to drive a car that their parents or grandparents would drive does anyone know where i can get a laser engraved plate frame i want to have it crystallized by the guys at autoicingcom have you tried an internet search im sure there are companies out there who have web sites that provide this service for those of you in the tri state area the show dates are april 14 through the 23rd from a distance i saw what appeared to be a small cheap black compact parked close next to my g35 sedan as i approached i was thinking that i hoped the occupants didnt ding my door with their little car i was surprised when it turned out to be a new 3series it was only the second i had seen in person the first was from the rear on the road i was struck by how small it seemed and its lack of presence next to my g35 the styling is not attractive to me and the rear is especially bad add to that the fact its way overpriced and its definitely out as an option when my lease is up in june i would not even consider the tl because of the fwd hondaaccord platform and the quality issues my friend has had with his headliner falls down paint falls off etc the lexus shotcomings are as you mentioned  it will probably steal some sales from bmw automatic buyers its styling and size seem similar to the bmw while the infiniti coupe is a great looking car i like the practicality and convenience of the sedan and imho i think the sedan looks better for a sedan than the coupe does for a coupe i was going to test drive the new 3series but that is no longer necessary it may handle a litte better than the g35 but so does a go cart and its not enough better to make a difference when size styling and other factors are considered i am looking forward to a 2007 6mt g35or g37sedan but ill exercise my purchase option or get a short lease on a 2006 if i cant get the 2007 before i have to turn my 2003 6mt in as far as im concerned there are still no real competitors to the g35 in a rwd 6mt sedan as far as im concerned there are still no real competitors to the g35 in a rwd 6mt sedan possibly why you are not called upon by the auto enthusiast press to offer your expertise to the public this is a fairly pathetic comment that in combination with the rest of your opinion holds little value for anyone looking for a realistic review of the distinctions of these fine cars the bmw lexus acura mb et al are all fine examples of their makers take on the small sporty sedan category they may have a similar mission and respective execution toward that mission may be similar in some respects but all are not viewed the same by each consumer due to unique qualities of the driving and ownership experinece important to each individual my guess is that your perceptions may most likely not be widely agreed upon maybe im wrong paragraphs are helpful things ive deleted the rest but that was the primary point im looking forward to buying one of those small cheap in this case red compacts  a 325i you probably dont care but most of the rest of the world does quite nicely with smaller cars with smaller engines i guess you come from the size matters school of thought lets hear it for presence another board has put forth the notion that any vehicle with less than 250 hp has no business claiming to be luxury in any shape manner or form others of us think differently handling matters fuel mileage matters many things matter that american marketing tends to ignore you are entitled to your opinion but so are the rest of us so i ended up going from an e46 330i zhp to an e90 330i if infiniti can button down the handling id be happy to jumop ship as far as im concerned there are still no real competitors to the g35 in a rwd 6mt sedan just because you dont like the dimensions and rearend styling of the new 3series it doesnt mean that its not a real competitor to the g35 just because you dont like the dimensions and rearend styling of the new 3series it doesnt mean that its not a real competitor to the g35 how about the fact that a premium pack 330i is 4500 more than a premium pack g35 sorry i thought my post was clear that i was expressing my opinion of my choices with my money for my money it is the right size and offers what i want and the others dont and again it is my money i am spending it is like ones opinion whether he likes spinach or the color purple its not arguable but it may certainly be discussed if you all want posts with facts than why bother  just go to a car magazine manufacturers specs etc i thought these boards were about opinions and impressions posts constantly regurgitating the same facts would be boring indeedie the infinit has 298 hp the lexus has 306 hp\\ni was actually looking forward to checking out the new 3series and i was expressing my dissapointment and i thought i was being respectful and conveying my thoughts about my decision process as other posters are talking about theirs i was and am really somewhat upset that i find no other alternatives attractive at this time i did not say that there were no alternatives for others only that there are none for me at this time who wants a 6mt sedan not a coupe in the right size for me not too big not too small etc if price were no object and a coupe was desired my first choice would be an m3 and that is just the right size for that type of car if you dont want to hear others comparisonsopinions than whats the point of discussing them i dont think i criticized anyone elses opinion and did not expect to get flamed for apparently having the wrong opinion i have been very happy with my choice of a g35 and would not want it to be smaller or bigger but i do need to decide on a replacement for it not owning any of these cars i did own a bmw 1600 for 10 years from 1970 to 1980 i have no particular bias one way or the other as such i interpreted your first post as simply your opinion why the g35 fits your needs best unfortunately some people dont like it when their opinion of which is the best car isnt shared by everyone thats why all these edmunds forums continue to rehash the same discussions over and over and probably few if any opinions have been changed how about the fact that a premium pack 330i is 4500 more than a premium pack g35 qbrozen that might be your reasoning but the original poster robertr never gave that as a reason i highly suggest reading through his post i posted this over in the bmw 3series 2006 forum but i thought it is applicable here as well good safety review for bmw and its new 3series httpwwwiihsorgratingsratingsbyseriesaspxid458 i agree its really about the price more for the bmw less for the subaru it seems that over four years the g35 sedan is evolving into the coupe with headroom its also lighter and cheaper evenso it has gained weight 3369 to 3449 and relatively more in the front 5248 to 5347 does anyone know the specific technical differences one more thing but i digress are splash guards really really worth interrupting those clean lines wow do i envy you i wish i could decide whether or not a car was worthy of my hardearned money based simply on seeing one in a lot sure would save me a lot of time  then again i like test driving new cars i usually have to test drive them before i can dismiss them except when they dont over a manual then its a slamdunk ps for the record i think the new 3 is too big bring back the e30 since you quoted him i didnt think it necessary if the quote you pulled wasnt representative of your argument  well lets just say you might want to be more careful and direct in the future to avoid confusion no harm done i am trying to decide which one is the better value i need a car that will handle well on bad roads as i live in the upper midwest i know the a4 quattro will be less expensive but am concerned about reliability after reading many postings any thoughts would be appreciated assumption when you say i need a car that will handle well on bad roads as i live in the upper midwest what you are really saying is i need a car that can absorb rough roads and pot holes without destroying wheels and tires i would think that either would be sufficient assuming of course that you dont opt for the sport package on the a4 20t which has the same rubber as does the a4 32 it all rests with the amount of distance between the rim and the tread consider the following audi a4 32 tire 23545 r17  sidewall height 420\\nbmw 325i  xi tire 20555 r16  sidewall height 444\\naudi a4 20t tire 21555 r16  sidewall height 466 as you can see the nonsp version of the a4 20t has the greatest side wall height while the narrower tread of the 325i will allow it to cut through the snow better which one is the best if you want awd and a true sp then your only option is the a4 best regards\\nshipo i am trying to decide which one is the better value i need a car that will handle well on bad roads as i live in the upper midwest i know the a4 quattro will be less expensive but am concerned about reliability after reading many postings any thoughts would be appreciated audis are getting killed in reliability ratings lately are you committed to an entrylevel luxury sedan those w low profile tires  billed as great handling will almost certainly provide a rough ride in upper midwest roads ie pothole city maybe consider something along lines of acura mdx if you want the luxury feel and the good ride quality maybe consider something along lines of acura mdx if you want the luxury feel and the good ride quality at the expense of any decent handling at all any 3series or a4 even without the sport package will be able to run rings around an mdx geez i cannot even in my weirdest dreams nightmares actually imagine cross shopping an mdx with either of the two german sedans meade is looking at thought 2 maybe meade is looking for a sedan that has a manual transmission that in and of itself would rule out an mdx best regards\\nshipo i just traded my 4 year old 325xi in for a a4 cabriolet that is audis 30 awd convertable i believe that i may trade my loyalty to audi for good i also have a bmw x3 the a4 did go for 50k but it is a solid luxurious performance vehical a big reason for the trade is that i was tired of taking the bmw to the shop the 325xi had recently developed rattles in the back seat that prevented me from driving it or being a passenger i love the a4 many things seem smarter in the cabriolet the transmission is a fancy multitronic breed and is very nice many of the techno features seem better the luxury inside is more plush in the audi have yet to see how it is in four years however many reviews out there point at this model as being a solid value i just traded my 4 year old 325xi in for a a4 cabriolet a big reason for the trade is that i was tired of taking the bmw to the shop umm youre tired of taking your bmw to the shop so you bought an audi yikes so taking an audi to the shop isnt as tiresome so taking an audi to the shop isnt as tiresome my point was that audi tends to have a worse reliabilityservice record than bmw it certainly isnt an upgrade which is what the original poster was implying bdr m bad i pressed the wrong reply button sorry heres another piece of anecdotal evidence a work colleague of mine bought one of these after less than a year she either sold it or got them to take it back on a lemon law case due to the amount of time it spent in the shop hope your luck is better i just purchased an a4 and didnt look into the reliability of it prior to leasing but i had a 2004 325i it was in the shop a lot all because of computer problems i almost think they over enginer some of those cars with too many gadgets the computer system would malfunction every couple weeks and i would have to take it in finally they took the car back and i ended up getting an x5 never had any problems with the x5 and havent had any yet with the audi which i love by the way maybe the audi shop has different magazines the only real contenders in this class are the bmw 3 series infiniti g35 and leuxus is 250350 a4  for those who cannot afford an a6 plus it is outdated\\ncclass  for those who cannot afford an eclass plus it is outdated\\ntl  nice car but it seems a little large for this segment\\ncts  no serious luxsport sedan fan would even consider this atrocity buckle up and hold on because the new big three in this segment are going to be churning out some fantastic cars in the upcoming years be looking forward to the new is500 v8 coupe and bmw twinturbo 3 series coupe the a4 and c class are only for people who cant afford the a6eclass you believe this yet dont believe the 3series and is are only for people who cant afford the 5seriesgs ive always felt this line of reasoning and it pops up here at edmunds often lacks merit in general but applying this reasoning to audi and mb but not to bmw and lexus just seems ignorant to me i think you need to learn about three little letters  i m and o the tl seems too big you obviously havent checked the dimensions of the g35 lately  3500 and 112 wheelbase no serious luxsport sedan fan would consider the cts youve never driven it have you you may not care for it i dont either btw but it is a capable performer and satisfying to drive big 3 huh imo there are at least 9 players in this segment and subaru and mazda are knocking on the door and stealing sales all of these companies have exciting cars on the horizon a4  for those who cannot afford an a6 plus it is outdated hmmm it seems to me that the a4 in quattro guise wins plenty of races over the 3series and others in the european car formulas how is it not a contender best regards\\nshipo edit ohhh i see fedlawman took the bit in his mouth as well  the 3 series is currently the most sought after sport sedan bmw designs it for people that are looking for a 3 series experience mb designs the cclass for people that want a mercedes but cannot afford an eclass price tag the lexus es is built more for people that cannot afford their higher models mb and audi must feel this way too since they put very little effort into their designs i drove a cts at gm event in fall 2004its plain garbage drove like an abrams tank and had an outdated interior suffice to say that the above list of comments are your opinion and not true facts well that may not be totally true they are indeed facts to you the flip side is that i will take issue with your assertion that the is is a true contender geez that car is simply a poseur car especially with the automatic only is350 yeesh so are my opinionsfactoids any more accurate than yours i doubt it blush best regards\\nshipo come on man it is certainly not a poseur car its very fast and handles well great engine and is based on a brand new platform when i see a cclass and an a4 i just see that their respective companies simply have these cars available for people that like their brands but dont want to pay a huge price tag what did audi do with their redesign gave it all red tail lights and a beard take a look at the a8lgorgeous why didnt as much thought go into improving the a4 conversely when bmw made the e90 3 series they knew that it was immensely important to their brand and they made huge improvements to it to respond to what 3 series customers were looking for more modern styling more power more lxury and its selling very well come on man it is certainly not a poseur car its very fast and handles well great engine and is based on a brand new platform ahhh i think you got my point to me any car in this class that cannot be had with a true three pedal manual transmission is a poseur car my opinion which is of course a fact to me and only me  regarding your comparison of the 3series and a4 visàvis the other cars in their lineup that doesnt really hold water either why simply because the audi a8 and a6 redesigns typically happen before the a4 just as the 3series was the last bmw to be bangalized that having been said audi has a history of face lifting the a4 just prior to a complete redesign and this seems to be the case here as well given that an all new a4 is due out next year as such i think youve jumped the gun in your analogy by several months at the very least best regards\\nshipo so are auto 3s and a4s makes up about 8090 of sales depending on who you ask poseur cars it was just a response to the market maybe a mistake for lexus but not a huge one since the market for manuals is very small i would like to enjoy a manual but i just spend too much time in heavy traffic to deal with that are different things to different people come on man it is certainly not a poseur car its very fast and handles well great engine and is based on a brand new platform ive driven the is350 it certainly is fast probably one of the fastest cars ive in my short 14 years of driving exeprience ever driven next to my dads 66 427 corvette roadster and a family friends 89 porsche 944 turbo i didnt like the way it handled lots of body roll  too softly sprung my tastes the copious use of i  my denotes this is in fact an opinion not fact as far as the stick thing goes lexus offers a manual in the is250 it wouldnt hurt for them to put one in the is350 if they dont sell just yank it from production after the first 2 years simple as that bmw audi mb acura cadillac infiniti all offer 3 pedal versions of their respective cars in this segment no matter how few

just my opinions i voted with my money though so this wasnt a hyopthetical exercise i would like to enjoy a manual but i just spend too much time in heavy traffic to deal with that you suffer so much traffic that you cant own a manual tranny yet you need a 35000 sedan with sport suspension and 306hp your logic is astounding neko sorry i ever doubted yourotflmao and your personality is astounding why do you have to resort to personal attacks i dont get why you mt afficionados are so pompous whether youre driving a honda civic or a 5 series if a 35000 sedan with sport suspension and 250300 hp is so illogical then why do so many people drive them and if you didnt like my analysis check out blueguydotcoms who said that they all pretty much suck surprise most people drive automatic transmission camrys and accords if they dont drive an suv this board is an alternate universe where each sedan is compared to a mythical sports machine that can outrun a corvette outhandle a porsche 911 and still get front row valet parking when you go out to dinner with 4 people in the car i want power and handling at a price i can afford in a comfortable goodlooking sedan most of this class is even sold with automatic transmissions against our sport sedan wishes nirvana for me would be a manual 4 door m3 at a 40k base price nirvana for me would be a manual 4 door m3 at a 40k base price youre a few years too late for that the last 4 door m3 was the e36 produced from 19971999 i think that could be had for around 40k i want power and handling at a price i can afford in a comfortable

time but the g35 is 2nd cts  merc c are tied for 3rd that said my present vehicle with a manual is hanging in there no rush i actually bought it as i will the next and it is hands down the car i would buy for my wife or sister my younger brother gets the g35 as it is less money and more power havent figured the is 350 out unless it is me in 10 years when i get too lazy to shift and like the service and reliability lexus offers im keeping my 2 year old 330i performance package manual i really like the fact that i average 30 mpg doing 75 mph have almost sports car handling with decent acceleration and a few luxury features like heated leather sports seats and xenon lighting i dont get why you mt afficionados are so pompous im not an mt afficionado my volvo is a quiet and comfortable automatic tranny car its got a soft suspension and 170 hp  perfect for rush hour if a 35000 sedan with sport suspension and 250300 hp is so illogical then why do so many people drive them i dont know you tell me gee i dont knowyou must be right and everyone else must be stupid i guess well different people look at different things  and rank things differently in order of importance someone wrote about 20 posts ago that the mb cseries is for those who cant afford the eseries hah total bs imo i want a small maneuverable car with a tight turning radius and a high performance engine the tl doesnt give that neither does the mb eseries the cseries does for that matter the 3series bmw does as well not quite to the same degree but close id never consider the tl too wide a turning radius too big or the eseries for the same reasons neko rumor says lexus will offer a manual for the 2007 model not sure if its going to happen but lets wait and see lexus will bring is300 back in the fall this year not sure how many trims but they sure have more horsepower than current is250 models btw which dealer did you purchase your is350 from i got quite a deal at lexus of naperville woodfield schaumburg  arlington palatine did not give me a lot of room for negotiation and hence i ended buying at naperville dealer my eye on the purported 335i that will arrive in 07 or 08 i heard that the 335i will be sold solely as a coupeconvertible if that is the case then i am not interested in the 335i if a 35000 sedan with sport suspension and 250300 hp is so illogical then why do so many people drive them i dont care if 6 billion in this globe drive one i want mine with a stick why do you have to resort to personal attacks i dont get why you mt afficionados are so pompous whether youre driving a honda civic or a 5 series i like to have the option of manual when i buy a car does that make me pompous i like to have the option of manual when i buy a car does that make me pompous no but your opinion of people that drive an at does i dont care if 6 billion in this globe drive one i want mine with a stick\\nyaaaaaaaaaaaaay good for you dewey i looked at woodfield mcgrath and arlington nobody seemed to have much inventory for the 350 none of them would negotiate too much i ended up going to woodfield just because they had the color i wanted come in they are very nice at woodfield and mcgrath arlington is kind of creepy feels more like a chevy dealer there \\ni wish i could decide whether or not a car was worthy of my hardearned money based simply on seeing one in a lot  you can if you dont like the way it looks its not worth your money whats hard about that confuse no but your opinion of people that drive an at does your tranny choice is your choice why should other peoples opinions bother you i dont know why dont you tell us i dont care if someone drives an mt or at but you obviously look down on those that drive at \\ni drove a cts at gm event in fall 2004its plain garbage drove like an abrams tank and had an outdated interior you didnt mean it that way but that would actually be a compliment the abrams tank drives quite well it can literally turn on a dime theres not a car on the planet that can remain flatter in a turn and if it had abs it could probably stop from 60mph in under 80 surprise p p  i want a small maneuverable car with a tight turning radius and a high performance engine the tl doesnt give that neither does the mb eseries  huh confuse the tl has a 260something hp engine and you do know theres a such thing as the e500 and e55 amg confuse whens the last time you did some research but you obviously look down on those that drive at i do confuse whoops that wasnt you that said that earlier sorry  i want a small maneuverable car with a tight turning radius and a high performance engine the tl doesnt give that neither does the mb eseries  huh the tl has a 260something hp engine and you do know theres a such thing as the e500 and e55 amg whens the last time you did some research ill try to respond for himnote the bolded part the tl has a 260 hp engine but doesnt come close on the bolded partespecially the turning radius you might need to return to school to learn how to read a sentence containing an andhint it means both things have to be true neither the tl nor the eclass are large cars and theyre both maneuverable your point was neither the tl nor the eclass are large cars and theyre both maneuverable your point was i was just commenting on the tl according to theautochannelcom here are some turning ratios for cars in this class 2006 is250  355\\n2006 g35  36\\n2006 330i  361\\n2006 e series  374\\n2006 tl  397 2006 crown victoria  403 now do you see the point the tl has a turning ratio much closer to that of a crown victoria than to other cars in this class see how someone could say that the tl isnt a small maneuverable car with a tight turning radius  not just my opinion either i have read many reviews by people who liked the tl who complained about the turning radius and how that makes maneuvering in tight spaces parking garages for example a pain the tl has a 397 foot turning radius geez even the 300c beats it by nearly a foot with a 389 rating and the avalon betters the tl by almost 3 feetat a 330ilike 369 but of course the avalon isnt small and its not a sports sedan to answer the original question id go check out the 330i i love my tl so dont get me wrong the turning radius sucks my partner and i laugh about it when we are in tight spaces we call it our little yacht i have gotten very efficient at three point turns ill second that the tl is fab but it does have the turning raduis of well a crown vic other than that it is powerful and maneuverable but not a small car either midsize thanks for your post ive been searching for turning circle data for a number of cars and your post filled in a couple of blanks besides which the link absolutely rules in terms of comparative data i was able to fill in a couple dozen more blanks in my excel sheet with what i learned there with more to come thanks again except for the avalon all of the cars listed with short turning radii are rwd cars vs the fwd acura fwd geometry accounts for most of the difference couple that with aggressively wide tires and it isnt surprising errr how about the audi a3 and a4 the are rated at 3510 and 3640 respectively  best regards\\nshipo doesnt count they arent on the list above id tell you more but it would be offtopic are known for their exceptionally wide turning radiuses i practically have to make a 3 point turn to get into straight parking spaces with my prelude a small price to pay for great handling are known for their exceptionally wide turning radiuses i practically have to make a 3 point turn to get into straight parking spaces with my prelude a small price to pay for great handling but why pay that price for great handling when you dont have to the is250 g35 330i a3 and a4 to name a few all handle at least as great as any honda or acura many would say they handle better than any honda or acuraand are much easier to park focusing in only on turning radius as a way of comparing these cars is inherantly unfair while the tl may have a much larger turning radius it is also a much larger car than the 3 series bmw add to that the 18 wheels and wide tread and that results in a wide turning radius given the size difference i see these cars being in the fringe of one anothers class from a comparison perspective i just bought a maxxed out maxima sl that compares more directly with the tl and they are almost same in size performance and turning radius add to that the 18 wheels and wide tread and that results in a wide turning radius say what the diameter of the wheel has nothing whatsoever to do with turning radius fwiw the tl comes standard with 23545 r17 mounted on 17 rims best regards\\nshipo focusing in only on turning radius as

compares more directly with the tl and they are almost same in size performance and turning radius i was focusing on turning radius as an objective measure of maneuverability i certainly wouldnt buy a car strictly based on turning radius but it goes into the equation for me and there isnt a size difference between the tl and the g35both have 98 cubic feet of passenger volume the 330i does only have 93 btw  trunk volume of the tl is only 125 cubic feet compared with 148 for the g35 330i is 120 so i could argue that the g35 is overall passenger plus trunk a larger car than the tl with a much smaller turning radius the tl is at a disadvantage in terms of maneuverability because of its front wheel drive designnot trying to reopen the frontvsrear debate i think that the tl is a great overall car i find myself in parking lotsgarages fairly frequently so turning radius mades a difference to me there are obviously good and bad points for all carsturning radius is a bad point for the tl i heard that the 335i will be sold solely as a coupeconvertible if that is the case then i am not interested in the 335i it would be the 335ci then i dont buy that for an instant the i has been in need of a powerful sedan version since the e46 changeover bmw screwed sedan drivers with the e46 m3 an e90 m3 sedan would be great but far too many people make an ignorant connection between 2 doors and sports cars v 4 door cars id much rather the stiffer chassis of a sedan and the framed window glass over the flexible design of the coupe and its lousy window design no but your opinion of people that drive an at does nothing pompous about saying at drivers are lazy seems to be a factmost will cite i drive in traffic wahwahwah neither the tl nor the eclass are large cars and theyre both maneuverable your point was point of view if an e46 feels large then its quite possible for some of us to find the the tl and e to be positively massive my bad i meant 335ci bmw is being presumptious not only in their connections between sport and two doors but also with nonsport and touring wagons if there was a bmw 330xi touring or even better a 330i touring prefer rwd i would have one in my garage right now unfortunately bmw only sells 325xi touring and 530xi touring wagons not my idea of excitement at all or how about the 1 series hatchback wagon nope not here folks we are going to have to settle for a 1 series coupe shame shame bmw at least audi caters to seekers who want more sport in their wagons by selling a4 32 and s4 avants and ofcourse the a3 quattro it would be the 335ci then rumor has it that bmw is dropping the c designation i guess somebody in munich figured out that there are other ways to determine whether its a coupe or a sedan counting the doors perhaps keep in mind its information i got secondhand so its not worth much well at least we agree on something dewey hatches are cool i dont know what id do if i didnt have one hatchback to carry stuff in i hate having to put a bunch of stuff in a conventional trunk its so cumbersome after using wagon for hauling things cheers and here is another point we can agree upon it is a shame lexus killed off the is crossover i am surprised at how well infinitinissan have held the details on the upcoming g yes we saw the likely coupe version displayed but as far as i know there are precious few technical details available on it or the fourdoor which will be shown in ny in a few weeks some japanese magazine speculated on a 37l engine and supposedly nissan has trademarked g37 m37 etc but we have heard nothing that i know of regarding specs on this engine or anything else transmission etc about the new g nissan is almost toyotalike on hiding the info this time what for petes sake is all of this preoccupation with turning radius unless you are directionally challenged and need to make repeated uturns on narrow roads i cannot imagine the average driver turning their steering wheel lock to lock frequently enough to have the turning radius be an issue i have a tl big and a 911 small and i can honestly say that neither one of them can do a complete one shot uturn on my street and yet neither one of them has ever presented me with the slightest problem in dcs tightest underground parking garages some people carefully position their vehicles between the lines others abandon them somewhere in the parking lot if the ability to do the former is at all important turning radius enters the picture back in the day when i was paid by the mile to drive we usually referred to the trucks that werent lined up properly as company drivers fwiw those who own their own tractors dont look too highly upon people who get paid by the hour  appear to lack certain skills the ability to precisely position a vehicle is important to some of us not so much to others give me 40 acres  ill turn this rig around has a point to make but i very much appreciate not having to deal with it in my daily driver those fwd fans who dont notice the difference would make great truck drivers some people carefully position their vehicles between the lines others abandon them somewhere in the parking lot if the ability to do the former is at all important turning radius enters the picture\\n______________________________________________\\nwell damn enter me into the parking olympics surprise\\ni have never ever had the remotest difficulty positioning my tl or former fwd maxima between the lines of a parking space either your pulling my leg on this in which case i compliment your subtle humor or youre actually serious in which case i think youve really tipped the scale from the sublime to the completely absurd i should have included two more words  more easily as in if the ability to do the former more easily is at all important   you are correct it is possible to perfectly park any vehicle given sufficient skill andor time the pleasant thing at least in my world is to be able to turn on a dime therefore do a number of things more quicklyeasily perhaps im looking for a reason why so many people park the way they do its a fools mission to be sure given the number of people who dont use directional signals it all comes down to being considerate  or not perhaps im looking for a reason why so many people park the way they do its a fools mission to be sure given the number of people who dont use directional signals it all comes down to being considerate  or not now there is something we can agree on  what possesses some people to park as though they are mentally and physically challenged ill never know just this weekend i was out with the girls in our 911 im not the type that will park in the next zip code but i will pull tight against the curb on a space that is on the right side of a set gives the car next to my left plenty of room and usually takes me out of range of thier passenger door did that in the corner of a restaurant parking lot on saturday came out to find the only other car in the section a fx35 immediately on my left a full two feet into my parking space making it impossible for me to open my door wide enough to access the back seat intentional who knows but as i was loading both of my kids into the back from the passenger side guy pulls up in a utility van and says looks like you need help he then pulls in tight next to the drivers side of the infiniti with about 3 to spare and has his buddy back into the space im vacating there was no way anyone was getting inside that infiniti except through the rear hatch not something i would encourage in front of my kids but i definitely got a kick out of it i am looking at a 325xi list 3859500 my net 3684700 has premium auto cold weather and satellite prep can i do better i am in nj price is from flemington yea thats an insult to abrams tanks parking makes me nuts i left my car in my companys parking structure sunday the place was totally empty and i parked 10 spaces from the elevator when i returned with a friend some er parked right next to my car he had the entire structure and much closer spots to the elevator arghstill mad thinking about it i feel your paini just noticed a new kink in the side of my g35 and no idea where this comes fromand its quite deep tooi am the person that would park in the next postal code in a parking lotdrop off my passengers and then go park or pull into those end spots and park really close to the side without a sparking spot i sometimes park at the back of the lot with many empty spots to the left and right and empty rows to the back and front and people still park beside my car  no reason ever for anyone to be even close to my carbut somehow they find themselves there and batter the heck out of my carsometimes i think my car must be a big magnet that just pull other cars in wherever i park count me as a turning radius enthusiast in 25 years of driving i never was concerned about it  never even thought about it of course for 14 years of that 25 i had a car which had a tight 32 turning radius i cant find any decent cars on the market that can match that today well anyway when i got my most recent car the turning radius is between 39 and 40 im appalled i live in an urban area i cant make tight turns it takes 3 tries to get into parking spaces that i used to do in 1 i have now added turning radius tightness as a major consideration in the cars im looking at i am the person that would park in the next postal code in a parking lotdrop off my passengers and then go park or pull into those end spots and park really close to the side without a sparking spot i sometimes park at the back of the lot with many empty spots to the left and right and empty rows to the back and front and people still park beside my car  no reason ever for anyone to be even close to my carbut somehow they find themselves there and batter the heck out of my carsometimes i think my car must be a big magnet that just pull other cars in wherever i park for whatever reason cars that are conspicuously parked far away become a target for animosity i think some people viewed it as snobby and assume the owner thinks my car is so good that it doesnt deserve to be near the commoners cars whether that is the owners intent or not some other driver just have to lash out and be jerks obviously the car being parked far away isnt hurting anyone in fact it actually leaves more closer spaces open its really a cowardly act since there is often a low likelyhood that theyll get caught oh well confuse'"
